Harry, "How can I help you?" Harry asked.The redhead nodded and said with a soft voice: The only thing that is preventing me from teaching in this school year will be the teachers' lack of knowledge about potions."Do not worry," Hermione reassured him as she walked out to her room for breakfast next door where everyone else was asleep after being told all their secrets by Dumbledore before them both left at 4 am on Wednesday morning to go back home until Monday evening when they would have some time

Harry were silent for a moment, before the boy just stared at him. "Why did you ask me to be your apprentice?" he asked."I'm not sure," Harry answered straightly and quickly put his arm around her shoulders as she nodded slowly in agreement again - though with some surprise there was no real emotion or lack of interest on her face after that time anyway".It's about having fun while being magical... I think it will make people more curious...""Well then! There is one other

Harry."He nodded. "I am glad to hear you are here, Severus," he said gratefully in return for the kiss that was now on his lips as well - a genuine smile wrapped around their face. He turned and stepped back into Suri's arms again before placing her hand on Sirius' arm; she took it gently but gave him another squeeze when she saw Harry still standing next door at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry with an airy grin across both hands tightly pressed against hers

Harry, who had a worried expression on his face. "You're being mean to me.""I'm not," Harry agreed."Yes you are" Dumbledore said sternly and then looked at the man with that sad smile of an owl as he took out two daggers from one pocket before shooting them through him in half-hearted laughter - which was quite amusing considering how clearly it seemed like Harry's mind wanted nothing more than revenge for what Voldemort had done after seeing this."So... What happened?" asked

Harry to the side, she thought. He was still in the kitchen and having a good time with her."You know what?" Harry asked after he sat down on his bed next to Hermione's girlfriend Annie who had been sitting at an empty table beside him as they waited for their room mates back up the stairs."I'm sure it is," Mrs Norris said quietly once more before sighing softly into Nate Silver from behind while Tom continued reading another letter which seemed almost like something out of The Wizard Wheez

Harry was still out of breath. He reached for his wand and put it on the table beside him."Potter, I have no idea how to proceed," he said calmly before pulling himself up off her in a matter-of fact manner but not by force or violence"I am glad you are alright Harry Potter is getting better as always.""Thankyou Mr Malfoy that has been a pleasure seeing your hand again""Goodbye mate!" he yelled back at her with those two words burning inside them like hot

Harry-Who-Mustn't Have... He's a Death Eater! I've been looking for him since he was born, and there are two of them in the castle. When you're not around, it'll be hard to find anyone who can protect Harry.""It must have really hurt," Snape said with an airy smirk on his face."You know that feeling when Voldemort is gone?" asked George nervously as they left the pub at 7:30pm on Saturday morning"Of course it

Harry's wand, and he felt it flare with a bright red glow. He turned around to see Draco in his common room."Oh! The potions master is here!" Harry exclaimed excitedly as he reached for the vial of potion ingredients which was wrapped tightly into an envelope under Snape "You're welcome... I'm sure you'll be fine though...""Thank Merlin," Snape said brightly.He bowed politely before handing over another letter from him to Hermione who had asked if she could come pick up some

Harry there is no way I can save you and this entire affair!" Harry protested. "What are we supposed to do now?""Leave," Suri said, standing up straight."No! This isn't my fault Sirius.""You're right not one of us has the guts or will dare challenge your authority over someone else's property..." She pointed out in a loud voice as her eyes scanned all around them for anyone who was still wearing their clothes or had made it outside with them."I'm sorry

Harry when I'm done with my summer holidays." She laughed. "I'll be back to see you at the end of September.""What?""Well, in case it's not clear now that Sirius is still alive," Hermione explained as she walked away.Hermione knew who he was and how he got his name from a missive sent out by the Ministry on behalf!"Hi! Sorry about all those letters we received this week but can't stop thinking for myself if there are any more questions

Harry, in a loud voice."You're not going to tell me I've had this dream before," Harry said firmly. "I don't want it.""Are you sure?""It's just that if Dumbledore knows about it, he'll know what we can do against him and how much worse things will get for us than being buried alive by our parents - or even Death Eaters! He would never have let the Ministry find out!" Ginny exclaimed with an amused grin as she hugged her husband."

Harry and Hermione, I know you're not exactly a friend of mine. And it would be unfair to think that your friendship with Harry is nothing more than an excuse for you being afraid."Hermione's eyebrows shot up in surprise at the thought as she looked down again "I'm sorry but what are we talking about?""Um...you have been missing something," Luna said gently trying her best smile at him before continuing on after them both answered "Nothing really.""You don't need me explaining anything

Harry at the same time. "You can't believe I am asking you this.""It's not your fault," Severus said, smiling slightly."I'm sorry that it happened to me or anything like a normal person would do if they knew what was going on and just told us their thoughts in advance instead of letting them tell others how things were coming out," he explained with more dignity than any other man had ever done before as well - although his eyes seemed quite pointedly serious for something so trivial.

Harry, who had been at the center of the battle for five years. I was a bit surprised to find out that you were still around when my brother died." Harry smiled sadly as he sat in his bed with Professor McGonagall. "I am glad.""It's alright," Hermione said softly and looked up into her father face again before she moved away from him so they could go back together on their own honeymoon after dinner later today...She sighed heavily. She knew it wasn't wise not

Harry. She was no longer in a mood to be alone, but she knew it wouldn't help her sleep."I don' want you around here," Harry said as he approached the fireplace with his wand pointed at Hermione's body and asked, "Do I need any of this?"Hermione nodded slowly before looking into him again for clarification on what had just happened that night"No!" Neville blurted out violently after hearing them both say such things togetherâ€¦And then they all stood there staring daggers

=== GENERATED SEQUENCE 16 ===
Harry had put in a request for an interview with Professor McGonagall, and she was surprised when Dumbledore refused. She found herself crying."I'm sorry... I just wanted to ask you something about the spell that makes me feel so alive...""Yes?""You're right! It's called my 'painting charm'." Dumbledore said as he looked at her."And how does it work? How do magic make you think differently? And why am ichor born of this spell?!" Hermione asked

Harry, he was already on his feet."Are you alright?" Harry asked as he pulled away from the redhead. "I'm fine.""You're right," said Hermione seriously and she looked at him with concern but nodded anyway to help her up a little bit so they could sit down again for tea."It's not like I can walk in here anymore... It sounds dangerous...""That is true!"Hermione gave Sirius an apologetic look before reaching out towards one of them without looking back even

=== GENERATED SEQUENCE 18 ===
Harry, the man who had brought me here to try and help you with your troubles is dead. But he will not live forever.""No! He's gone!" Harry cried out in pain."It was him," Mrs Norris said quietly as she took her wand from his pocket while looking at a faded photo of Ronald Weasley that was hung on one wall beside them - Hermione could tell it looked like an old photograph too: "Ronald spent most winters living in Albania until 1981 but now lives anywhere else except

Harry/Hermione. I am happy to help you out with your summer homework! You can use the class rooms at home or wherever." Hermione said as she led Harry in a large group of students through some slides and quizzes. They all sat down for the first time since their sixth year together, enjoying the fact that they were both able-bodied adults now so no one had ever been forced into sex work before... There was something about her smile which made everyone want more than anything. But then

Harry's hand was on his forehead. "It must be alright, Harry." His voice faltered slightly as he tried to steady himself and the tension in their bond grew even more apparent. He looked up at Hermione who was still sitting with her hands crossed in front of him while Professor McGonagall continued talking about how much they loved each other very dearly - it had been months since she'd last seen them together but when this past weekend finally came around then things were looking a lot better for both friends

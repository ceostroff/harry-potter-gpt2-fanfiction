Hermione was the one who had taken over."What?" Harry asked. "Do you think he is really mad? Do I have to tell him that or do we just keep quiet, and go home with Hermione for now"?"I don't know," said Harry bitterly.""Well then... Why not ask Mr Potter about it right away?", wondered Ginny nervously as she took a deep breath before nodding her head and leaving the room in peace again.''There's no need of any further trouble! You're already

Hermione smiled at her. "I think you should just tell me, Hermione.""Of course!" she said excitedly."Yes I will," Harry agreed and soon enough the two were kissing on a bed together that was still very much an old one as they had both been living with their parents for almost twenty years. It hadn't been pleasant though to be found out about things but it certainly wasn iced up by their friends so no surprise then.It took several days before Professor Snape called them back again

Hermione."He said, "I am glad you are here. I will be on my way soon.""Thank goodness for your help," Hermione replied warmly as she walked out of the classroom and into a small garden in front her with various plants growing around it while Harry looked after his father. He had read about him before but he couldn't believe that they would give their son such an opportunity to spend time together when so many people were already feeling lonely or scared.A few minutes later Hagrid arrived

Hermione looked up at the worried expression on her friend's face. "Don't worry, I'm just going to leave you alone for now."Harry didn?"I don' want any trouble," Hermione said softly as she hugged him tightly and kissed his cheek lightly before pulling back into a hug with Neville who wrapped hers around their neck again which he shared in another kiss that made everyone jump from one direction or other until they were both laughing hysterically when Harry finally spoke."So what do we have here

Hermione looked up from her book and smiled. "Well, I think this is a good time to make dinner."The waitress came in with two plates of grilled chicken and eggs on the side table which Hermione quickly grabbed. She took one bite at it as she held out both hands for Harry Potter - who had just come home after seeing his parents' dead body - before continuing down stairs into Gryffindor common room where he sat eating another plate while Ron talked about what was going through him and how

Hermione looked at him. "I'll be fine," she said, making Harry smile."You're welcome to come with me as soon you like.""Very well," he smiled and took her hand. She kissed him lightly on the forehead before heading out of his office for a quick shower after dinner in their new home that evening when they would return later this summer. They had just finished breakfast together but Hermione was already tired enough by then! So instead…she headed down the stairs towards bed again knowing it

Hermione and Hermione stood in the middle of a large circle and waited for their friends to join them. When they arrived, Harry saw two women with pink hair standing next one another. He quickly grabbed his wand, watching as the other woman began waving her magic around. She appeared at first confused but then she smiled broadly."Harry! How is your charm working?""It's just that it can only work when you are holding onto something or someone else," Hermione said calmly before smiling brightly again while looking back

Hermione's eyes widened and she knew that this was going to be awkward."I know, I just… we don't have time for such a discussion," Hermione said with an innocent smile. "But it is important.""Yes?" Harry asked. He saw her take another deep breath before he could say anything else but nod in agreement as she pushed him into the bed again where they sat together until late afternoon when they went upstairs at once so their things could get sorted out quickly without having too much fun or

Hermione frowned. "I'll just have to figure that out." She looked at her friend who shrugged and nodded slowly, taking in the appearance of a smile on his face as he continued walking up behind them with an impish grin across their faces before turning around once more after Hermione had finished speaking again.""Alright," she said quietly; they didn't need any more words for it was already over when Harry came into view from underneath the covers between two doors leading down toward Gryffindor Tower where Neville

Hermione looked up from her book and smiled at him. "So, how's your relationship with Harry going? I mean it has been a while since you last saw me.""I am really happy to see that he is still my best friend." Hermione said as she gave him an encouraging smile before hugging him tightly again for good measure"You know," Suri teased but nodded in acceptance once more when they had returned home. When the door was closed behind them Suru felt like stepping into someone else who

Hermione, in a nervous tone, shook her head. "I was just wondering if you want to go back there and meet me? I don't know how many times we've had sex or anything.""I'm not even sure," Hermione said with an angry look on his face."Well then it's my turn for the day! We should make our way over here before dinner so that can be quick."The two girls sat down at their table as Neville entered through one of those large windows where he

Hermione and I met up with Bill Weasley. He had a new girlfriend, Hermione Granger."Bill shook his head in disbelief before continuing to speak for Harry who was still fuming at the news that Ginny's body would be found within hours of being discovered by their parents.""I will give her my best wishes," said Harry as he sat down next door while Molly brought Teddy into Neville Manor where she offered him a kiss on one cheek after another but it didn't last long until they were both crying again when

Hermione raised an eyebrow at the boy."You know, I think it's nice to have you around. How are things going?""I am so glad that my mother and father could come along with us," Harry said smiling happily as he sat up straight on his bed in a hot towel next not far from Hermione where they shared towels together for warmth while she slept under her blanket. "It means such a lot.""How do we get there? Do any of our friends even want me here or anywhere

Hermione looked at the man in disbelief."I'm not mad," she said with a smirk. "But I am worried about you.""You don't seem to be so sure?" The older woman asked, clearly frustrated by her condition and Harry's response had been very emotional as well: He was always really happy when he could tell Hermione that his life was changing because of her illness - even if it wasn' magically possible for him right now...She sighed heavily before continuing on without comment again:"I

Hermione looked at her. "You're not going to be late? I'm so sorry!"She was glad she didn't have a second to herself."I'll miss you," Harry said softly, holding her hand as he continued his walk down the stairs towards Hufflepuff Tower and into Malfoy Manor - where they met with Neville Longbottom's father on Christmas Day 1991.Harry smiled warmly; although there were still some of those few months left before Hogwarts had ended he felt like this year would end

Hermione had put in a request for an interview with the Daily Prophet, and she was delighted that they were willing to answer her questions. She also wanted Harry Potter's mother - who would be joining the team this year as well...At first, Hermione thought he might have been jealous of his fame but then started wondering if it could change things once more."I am sure I will find him very interesting," said Ron Weasley curiously before continuing on"You mean like your parents? I'm not even thinking about

Hermione was a bit disappointed to find out that her blood status and the fact she didn't like it were all just as important to Harry."It's been an interesting year," he said, smiling at his wife. "We've grown up quite well.""I think we're on good terms with you now too. I'm not sure if what happened in school is going unnoticed or whether there are other things behind your curves which make people treat you differently than when they first met me?""Of course,"

Hermione was the only one left to do so, with Professor Sprout going straight for her. She had tried holding off on getting into the room before—she didn't know how long she'd been there; perhaps it wasn' enough time?—but now that all of them were gone, Hermione's mind couldn vernacular remained a mess."Don?'She glanced at him and then back up as if he hadn 'gone'. He seemed very nervous about her in general but his eyes made her feel

Hermione's eyes were wide with tears, and she looked at Harry."I want you to be happy," he said softly. "You're my best friend.""Thank goodness I'm not in love. No one ever says they are or wants me like that anymore!""But Hermione will always remember how much we bonded over the last few months because of each other so you have all this time together now?"Harry smiled warmly as his heart skipped a beat faster than it should've for no reason; just

Hermione smiled at the mention of her name."Thanks, Miss Granger. I'm sure you'll be fine.""I know," Harry said with a grin before he gave Hermione a hug that was so soft and warm it made his skin crawl up against hers as she kissed him on both cheeks lightly then turned to look back into James's face again after they had talked for some time 
together".Are you alright?" Sirius asked in a low voice but held his hand out to them all"Of course not!" Hermione

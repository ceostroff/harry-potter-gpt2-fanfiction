Hufflepuff was the first to take notice, but she didn't think it would be a bad thing. A year ago they had been in Gryffindor and were debating on their house positions! It wasn iced up that both Slytherin's and Ravenclaw hadn'nt won yet so this time around everyone thought he might have gotten more points for being an Hufflepuffs than his brother."What are you thinking?""I'm trying out of school.""You're not!" Harry yelled as

Hufflepuff were the only pureblood students who had been expelled, and Harry was glad that he didn't have to go through all of them. He wasn icky with his wand use but could cast spells on himself or a friend if necessary. It made him feel less like an intruder as well."Hermione's friends are still here," said Hermione seriously after she looked at her watchmate again in confusion for a second before continuing "I'm sorry about not getting back into classes sooner.""You're really going

Hufflepuff."He nodded. "I am glad to see you are enjoying the holidays, Severus," he said in a calm voice and a little shaky-voiced tone as if that was not what Dumbledore wanted him there for now anyway.""But why is it so hard?""Because they hate me because I'm their teacher, not your brother or sister!" Snape protested angrily at being called an uncle when he hadn't even heard of his father before Fred's death had happened last week... He wasn ick

Hufflepuff, on the other hand was too busy with her homework and drawing notes to notice that she wasn't doing anything. She glanced around as everyone stared at her, who were all looking shocked."So… what's wrong?" asked one of them nervously while another looked a bit worried.Hermione didn ive noticed how this whole situation had gotten outta control for Hermione because it seemed like every time Harry spoke about something he would end up in a conversation between herself or someone else being more than just plain

Hufflepuff was a little too easy to beat. He even had the perfect finishing move on his wand, but it would have been far easier if he'd shot himself in both hands first and then thrusting them at Harry with one hand before shooting him straight into Azkaban without having done anything else - or worse."You're not going anywhere!"Neville just smirked as well; despite everything that happened between them, Neville still managed this flick of energy from Draco's hex.oooIt seemed like every

Hufflepuff was a bit afraid to admit it. "It's not like you could have been more than that," she said quietly, and the Gryffindors' face contorted into an expression of shock."I thought we would do well with Slytherin?" Harry asked sceptically as he took out his wand from under him before setting down his wand again in front of her desk-Harry felt Hermione gasp and clutched at one arm whilst pulling on her own leg so hard they might crack when it

Hufflepuff team. He had been so happy that his best friend was safe, but now he found himself surrounded by everyone from the Slytherin house to Gryffindor and Hufflepuffs...even Death Eaters like Potter were looking forward on being friends with him!In fact it didn't matter if Dumbledore's plan worked or not anymore - Hermione wasn't sure how many people would be interested in her friendship as she knew they couldn ersually love each other anyway.The last time

Hufflepuff's Petunia and Neville were on the quidditch pitch at Flourish Cup. Harry could see his best friends' faces when they walked into the Great Hall, hugging each other."Thanks for staying with us," said Hermione as they sat down in their seats near Gryffindor Tower after a game against Ravenclaw Quaffle team. "I really hope we don't have to wait too long before I can join you.""It will be alright if it isn" said Ginny seriously though she

Hufflepuff had been the one to get him into a duel, and as such he was considered by most of them for that. This time around they were looking at James, who didn't want anything more than Sirius's help.Harry just stood there, quietly wondering why no one else would do this. He knew everyone hated their friends; even Dumbledore… but how could anyone believe it? All Harry cared about now wasn' his parents… and if only Osiris did something with Voldemort... And yet here we are

Hufflepuff had a good look at the house and headed to the cupboard. He looked around, but was met with people looking back in time."He's always been there for me," Harry said softly as he pulled out his wand from behind him"And you know I have no problem making sure that nobody gets hurt because of Potter or Dumbledore.""Of course not!" Hermione called over her shoulder trying desperately on an expression she'd never seen before when they were still friends together.",Harry chuckled lightly once again "

Hufflepuff, in a few minutes' time. It was obvious that she had never truly been able to get her mind off of what Harry saw as the Dark Lord's plan and just be on his side against Voldemort, but he seemed sure enough at least not too many people would have believed him if they knew this. Hermione found herself thinking back over it again."Harry! I am so sorry for being late!"The only thing keeping them together while Ginny readied herself mentally before returning with her own thoughts was

Hufflepuff and Slytherin. And the Hufflepuffs.""That's wonderful! I wish it was a bit easier on you, but for now I just want to be sure that when we go back into Hogwarts they will have no problems with us being there."Harry smiled at her before turning around so he could walk away from them with his cloak."Alright then," she said. "Let me know what your thoughts are about this chapter-""I'll see ya guys in Hogsmeade!"

Hufflepuff's defeat was rather surprising to the man, especially considering that he had been in such a good mood after having played so well. Even though his team were struggling against Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, they did not lose duelling until their first match of the season."You know I'm quite fond," said Harry as the Slytherins took turns playing Quidditch matches with Professor Pyrites, who sat across from them next door at breakfast just outside Parseltongue Hall on Saturday

Hufflepuff were the only ones who actually dared to venture outside of their dormitory. The adults sat down and set up a table with food on it, but there was no tea or coffee in sight."Hello everyone," Professor McGonagall said. "How is your morning?""Very good indeed! I am so glad you came back today after our break from work as well!" Harry exclaimed excitedly before continuing his thoughts about what had just transpired between them: he didn't know if Neville would be able

Hufflepuff. She was no longer in a mood to be an easy target for mischief and didn't want anyone else looking at her."I thought I would ask you something, Miss Granger," Severus said with regret as he pulled the bag over his head before continuing on without saying anything further about it or even bothering taking notes again - "You should go get some sleep then.""It's not like we have much time together right now..." He looked down into Harry who shrugged slightly apologetically but kept his eyes

Hufflepuff had put in a request for players to submit their names and letters, so that they could participate. They also invited both Slytherins into the tournament with interest from other teams too."It's been almost two years since we've gotten any good results out of this class," said Hufflepuffs headmaster Terry Trelawney-Granger before announcing his team as "The Ravenclaws". "We are proud each year to bring you all our best students but only one person is left

Hufflepuff."Harry's voice trailed off. "Are you alright?""Yeah, I'm fine.""I just…" he paused and looked up at the man in question—he was tall and handsome enough to be taller than Harry Potter himself but not as much of a size or height advantage due his deep brown eyes that had been fixed on him almost completely over time when they first met—his eyebrows creased slightly. He didn't look too good though. It wasn icky looking so it probably wouldn'

Hufflepuff was the most interesting match to watch and I will admit it is one of my favorite. The Wizengamot didn't play very well so there wasn' a lot that could have been done differently, but this game felt like they were able make some changes as long Asuna doesn'. At least she had her freedom in everything though...
It's not known how much longer until Harry Potter becomes canonically confirmed (though maybe he'll get an answer sooner rather than later), although we are still

Hufflepuff were the first to find out, and it was not until they had enough of their spells in hand that Harry could try and cast them. He wasn't even sure what he should do with the information yet but decided after a momentary pause as Hermione began speaking again."I know I shouldn' have gone for that one," she said quietly before continuing her explanation "It is just... It's good to see you! There are no mistakes.""That is quite true," Harry agreed while leaning back against

Hufflepuff's portrait was placed in the living room. "Who are you?""I'm Harry Potter."Tom nodded slowly and said, gently:Harry grinned at her as he saw that she looked quite nice. He took his time reading up on every aspect of magic for him before finally deciding to go with Remus."You don't look like a Weasley.""Not really," Tom assuredly replied absently; James could see how sincere they were both about their friendship - though it wasn icky-sweet

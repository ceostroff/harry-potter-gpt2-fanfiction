Mr. and Mrs. Granger were a lucky couple. They gave birth to two geniuses, a boy and a girl. The boy was Kent Granger and the girl was Hermione Granger.The brother and the sister, both were geniuses, not only for their academic excellence but also maturity. Anybody who interacts with the pair, praises Mr. and Mrs. Granger for giving birth to such good children.In fact both Mr. and Mrs. Granger themselves were very happy, not only because their children were geniuses but also for their filial piety.But who would've thought that reality was completely different.Kent Granger was in fact not actually the child of Mr. and Mrs. Granger, at least his soul or consciousness wasn't.He had memories of 30 years of life in a world quite similar to the current one, at least on the surface.If his guess was correct, then there might be another magical world hidden under the plain sight.The reason he suspected this was because his sister's name is Hermione Granger, who is two hours younger than him.He had watched the full Harry Potter series and their was a character named 'Hermione Granger', one of the lead characters played by Emma Watson.She looks a lot different than what was portrayed in the movie, her hair was more bushy and her front teeth were more distinct. The most confusing was her personality. She was mature and not so overbearing as shown in the movie. She might've acquired that quirk later.Kent sometimes suspects that she was more adult than him. It was quite a mystery.But he did not have the time to solve the mystery because if his speculations were correct and this world was indeed the fictional world of magic then it got a hundred fold dangerous especially if you're related to one of the main protagonists.There was another mystery, which was "how he died?". He didn't have the specific memory about it. He was going to marry the girl he was in love with. His last memory was meeting with his friends and inviting them to his marriage.The mystery was quite difficult to solve so he temporarily gave up, instead he started preparing for the worst.It didn't take long to confirm his guess though.On his and his sister's fifth birthday, there was a bizarre incident that happened which might be puzzling for the Granger Couple but for Kent it just confirmed his guess.A book was flung from the bookcase straight to Hermione's cousin who was making fun of her teeth. Fortunately her cousin was alright.This was a case of accidental magic. And it might indeed be the fictional world of Harry Potter or a parallel world quite close to the original fiction. He was not sure if his foreknowledge would be of any use. But that was a thing of far future at least six years later.Kent only hoped that he also had magic otherwise he didn't know how he would cope with the dangerous future that was probably gonna happen.As a muggle, he would be quite defenseless against magic.It didn't take long for his worries to transform into excitement though.On that night after the joint birthday celebrations when Kent was lying on his bed worrying about his future, a clicking noise sounded in his head.[Ding! Simulation system is Activated!]A string of white letters was floating in front of his eyes. He rubbed his eyes, but the string of letters was still present. He tried touching them but couldn't. It did not take long for him to calm down and think properly.'Okay then, I've got a system but I don't know what it's functions are. First I have check what this system is all about,' he thought as he took a long breath."Now let's see..., System what is your function?" asked Kent lowering his voice so as to not disturb his sister and parents.There was no response."Lord System, may I know what is your function and purpose?"Still no response."System, please?""B*ullsh*t System," Kent cursed out loud."Kent, what happened?" came a female voice from the next room. It was his mother."Nothing Mom, just some annoying fly," said Kent."Okay, sleep early son."'I might be hallucinating then,' concluded Kent after getting no response from the system.But there was still a bit unwillingness in him. So he decided to try again for the last time.This time, instead of shouting or cursing, Kent decided to concentrate on string of letters that was still floating in front of his eyes.Suddenly his vision darkened and he felt a suction force. But it was just momentary.As soon as his vision returned, he found himself in a dark room.Looking around he couldn't see the end of the room. There was like hue that was obstructing his vision.Suddenly a subtly glowing screen appeared in front him. It looked just like those 3d hologram in Sci-fi movies.Taking a closer look, he found that it was a panel with five options.oooDeduce and OptimizeSimulationLibraryDownloadInventoryooo'It's real!' exclaimed Kent in his mind.Coming closer, Kent clicked on the first option "Deduce and Optimize".The screen changed.oooDeduce and Optimize: With the help of the information stored in the library, the user can deduce and optimize anything, ranging from a solution of a question to optimizing martial arts skill etc. The user can also specify the requirements of the optimized result. There are currently five skills or solution that can be optimized simultaneously.Slots [5]1. (empty)2. (empty)3. (empty)4. (empty)5.

After that he checked each option one by one.oooSimulation: After optimization of certain skill, the user can experience and practice the skill. The time spent here is 100 times faster compared to real world.(Back)ooo"Hmm, this look useful. I have to test it. I will try it tomorrow." Kent muttered as he clicked on the next option.oooLibrary: The user can consciously store any form of data like book, picture, sound or symbol they see or hear. It serves as a data centre.(Tips: No matter what language the data is in, the user can translate the said data to understandable language.)Current Content : (Empty)(Back)ooo'Wow! That's a useful function!' Kent exclaimed in his mind. Returning to the previous page, he then clicked on the "Download" option.oooDownload: The user can download any data from the library to his conscious memory.Warning: May induce headache during downloadReminder: A humans memory is not unlimited.(Delete: User can clear certain data from their memory)(Back)ooo'With this, I can claim to have a photographic memory.' Kent concluded with excitement."Now let's see, the last one. Hmm, I hope it is what I think it is," Kent muttered as he clicked on the 'Inventory' option.oooInventory:A storage space of 5 cubic metres. Living beings are not recommended to be stored.Current Content: (Empty)ooo"Hmm, neither too large nor too small. Well it's enough space. It's a pity that living beings can not be stored." Kent sighed. He was not disappointed though. It was already a miracle to have a multifunction system.Suddenly a thought came to his mind."How do I get out of this place?" He asked himself."Let's try this."Closing his eyes he concentrated on the feeling when he was sucked into this place and thought about going out.And just like that he again felt a similar suction force and the next moment he found himself sitting on his bed, probably on the same spot before he entered into the black space of the system. He checked the time to find that he spent about half an hour inside the system space.After an hour of excitement, thinking about the future, how he would use the system to its best capacity, Kent was exhausted. After all it was a five year old body.He yawned and switched off the lamp. Lying on his bed it didn't take long before he fell asleep.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?

The next morning, Kent woke up a bit earlier than usual. Everyone including his parents were sound asleep.Yesterday's excitement still hadn't died down and he also wanted to confirm that the system was not a dream.Suppressing his hunger, he concentrated on the system. But unlike yesterday there was no suction force, instead the same panel appeared in front of his eyes.He was still in his room, just the screen was floating in front of him. He clicked on the "Optimization" option and just like previous time, another page appeared containing the description of its function."Phew! Fortunately it wasn't just a dream," he sighed with relief."Hey! Kent what are you doing?" came a girl's voice from the door which was ajar. She had already entered the room."Wha–?! Oh! Hermione, why are you here?" Quickly composing himself, Kent asked while pretending not to see the screen projected in front of him. He was also paying attention to Hermione, curious if she could see the screen."I just heard some noise from your room. As you never wake up so early, I thought I'd check up," answered Hermione."By the way, what were you doing waving your hand in mid-air?" she added with a doubtful look."Oh! Nothing, just that I was still sleepy and my eyes were a bit groggy." said Kent making up some stupid excuse under Hermione's scrutinizing gaze.But inside he was panicking.'Phew! Almost got caught, I have to be more cautious. Hermione is sharper than I thought. At least she can't see or touch the system screen,' he thought calming his nerve."Okay then, I'm gonna wake mom and dad," said Hermione."I've to brush my teeth," groaned Kent. As a son of two dentists, there's a distinct emphasis on dental health.After having breakfast, due to not having school today, Kent went went to the public library 10 minutes walk from home. Mr. and Mrs. Granger found nothing unusual about it though. After learning to read and write, Kent always have been fond of reading books. As for Kent himself, he had to endure 4 years of wobbly hand and feet to get used to the new body.Also, not to attract too much attention, he had to pretend to be a normal four year old boy occasionally showing some mature behaviour so as to appear as genius. Gradually he was able to show some of his excellence without garnering unwanted attention.With an equally excellent Hermione, the genius of the brother-sister pair was attributed to their genes."Hermione, do you wanna go to the library with me?" asked Kent."No, I will be staying at home for today." answered Hermione."Are you okay?" asked Kent as he brought his hands to Hermione's forehead to check her temperature."I am okay. I just don't feel like going to library today." said Hermione, avoiding Kent's hand."Oh, okay then," Kent sighed with disappointment but inside he was happy. He would be able to experiment with the newly acquired system without any difficulty.After 10 minutes of happy walk, Kent reached a huge building with an equally large door. The structure of the building was a bit old styled but that didn't diminish its majesty a bit.Checking in with the librarian, Kent took a book on exercises from the shelf and sat at one corner of the long table.No one was surprised seeing Kent reading a oversized book compared to his tiny hands, an annoyance Kent always complaining and grumbling about.The reason for the lack of surprise seeing a five year old boy reading a bit advanced book was Kent and Hermione's frequent visit to library as well as being an well known genius in the neighbourhood. They were a local celebrity.Opening the first page, Kent brought up the system panel and then the 'Library' option. After familiarising himself with system, Kent found that he didn't need to physically touch the screen to operate the system. With a mere thought everything could be done; it requires a bit of practice and concentration.Activating the library function, Kent read the book word by word. He didn't need to understand or read out loud the words.He finished reading the book within fifteen minutes as there were more pictures than words.One by one, Kent went to shelf and took out various books on exercises and martial arts.It was already noon when he was finished recording all the information available in the library about Martial arts and exercises.Although Kent's behaviour was a bit unusual today, the librarian didn't question him.'Maybe he didn't find what he was looking for,' thought the librarian. On asking, Kent simply said he was looking for more comprehensive book on martial arts.On hearing Kent's answer, the librarian suggested the name of some bookstores where he could find better martial arts book. The librarian also suggested that it was better to look for a dojo. Martial arts is after all oriented toward physical work rather than books and pen.Kent nodded and thanked the librarian for the advice. Kent couldn't just say that he had a system which could optimize and simulate martial arts. He himself even doubted the credibility of the said function of the system. Only time would tell whether it is as good as the description says.Saying goodbye to the librarian, Kent went home.After having lunch, Kent directly went to his room. After locking the door, he sat cross-legged on his bed and opened the system panel.After activating the "Optimize" option, a new page opened up.ooo[Finalise what you want as an optimized output](Blank)[Select the data based on which you want to optimize the result](1. Essence of Martial Arts by Jim Hoblin)(2. Martial Arts for dummies by Rob Demiurge)(3...)(4...)(5...)[Specify the basic qualities and purpose you want in your finalized output](Blank)(Submit) (Back)oooThe instructions were pretty clear, so Kent filled the first blank as (Martial arts that exercises and builds my body to its finest).As for selecting the data, he selected all 53 books, he recorded today in the library.Finally for the basic qualities and purpose, he wrote (1. No bulging or extra muscle, 2. No extra unnecessary movement, 3. Flexible and strong wrist, 4. Subdue your enemy in the fastest possible time, 5. Good evasion, 6. Short burst of high speed movement)Then with a thought, he submitted his entries. In the next moment, panel returned to it's previous page but there was an extra line under the "Deduce and Optimize" option.oooDeduce and OptimizeSlot[1] (Martial arts that exercises and builds my body to its finest [Estimated completion time 1 day 2 hours 5 minutes]SimulationLibraryDownloadInventoryooo"Now that the optimization is taking place, let's check the download function," muttering excitedly, Kent clicked on the 'Download' option and chose a book to download. After confirming his selection, with a thought he activated the process.The next moment..."Argh," groaned Kent while rubbing his forehead.'Sh*t! There was clearly a "mild" word before headache in the warning, so why the hell does it hurt so much?' Kent cursed in his mind.'Is my pain tolerance so little?' he shook his head so as to deny his own speculation.Soon the pain subsided and a new set of knowledge was present in his brain. It was like he memorised word by word and even the pictures were vivid."The pain was worth it though," he cheered."Now Let's check the 'Inventory' function," he decided.He picked up a toy car and then mentally activated the "Inventory" function. The toy car vanished from his right hand as if his hand wasn't holding anything before.He then reactivated the "Inventory" function, this time it was not to store something but to take the toy car that was stored inside the storage space. With a mental command, the small toy car appeared in his right hand.After experimenting with the "Inventory", Kent found that if he wanted to store an object, he must touch it with his bare skin, be it hand, leg or any other part of his body. Also the object must not shake too much or the speed of object must not exceed a certain speed relative to his body. The speed limit was yet to be determined; it required a more rigorous experiment.Checking the time, he found that it had already been 2 hours since he started experimenting with various functions of the system.As for the remaining two functions, he had to wait for the optimization to finish to ascertain the usefulness of the two said functions, whether their description was on point.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?

The next day, it was already 4 pm when Kent and Hermione returned from school. There was no fatigue whatsoever, instead a small smile hung on his face. Inside he was filled with excitement.He found that the process of optimization was finished. Now he only needed to check it.Suppressing his excitement, he with his sister Hermione ate their meal. After that he directly went to his room, saying he wanted to have a rest.Locking the door, he sat on the bed. With a thought, the system panel appeared in front of him.oooDeduce and OptimizeSlot[1] (Martial arts that exercises and builds my body to its finest [Complete]SimulationLibraryDownloadInventoryoooKent clicked on the "Slot[1]", a new page appeared. There was a download option below it, he clicked on it.Unlike yesterday, the severe headache that Kent was ancipating didn't come, instead it was far milder.'Did my pain tolerance go up?' He thought doubtfully, but soon it was replaced with excitement as a new set knowledge appeared in his mind. It included a set movement, the breathing rhythm, even the slightest movement of fingers were included.'It's too precise,' he thought.'Is it any effective though? But before that let's see how the simulation works.'Returning to the previous page he clicked on the 'Simulation' option. A new page appeared.oooSimulationSimulate (Martial arts that exercises and builds my body to its finest)?(Yes) (No)(Back)oooKent clicked on 'Yes', a new page appeared.The next moment, his surroundings changed from his room to a grass field. As far as eyes could see there was only green. There was no trees, houses or mountains, just plain grassland.Soon the system panel appeared.[Simulation Starts in 10 seconds][10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...0]When the countdown was finished, Kent found that his body was moving on its own.After few seconds, he realised that his body was moving according to the set of movements he just got. Even the breathing was not in his control. He could feel twitch of each muscle but couldn't control it.So instead of resisting, Kent started going with the flow. It went on for about an hour until his body stopped.There was no physical or mental fatigue.'It must be due the fact that it's just a simulation,' he whimsily concluded.In the last hour, his body repeated the movements about five times.A new page appeared on the system panel.oooManual Practice Progress: 0%25% - (Beginner)50% - (Intermediate)75% - (Master)100% - (Perfection)oooKent understood the purpose of the manual practice. Although in the auto pilot his body would move according to the optimized movements but it was after all auto pilot. To realise the movements in real life Kent needed to master them on his own.Kent closed his eyes, steadied his breath. Recalling his experience earlier during automatic simulation, he started moving.It was slow at first as Kent had to keep account of everything including movement of fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulders, knee and also rhythm of breathing, even breathing using the abdominal muscle.It was really difficult at first. But gritting his teeth, he kept going on. Whenever there was a slight mistake, a beep would sound in his mind and his body would go to auto pilot mode to correct his movements.He didn't know how many times he failed, but he didn't give up. The circumstances didn't allow him to give up.The knowledge of the terrible futurehad always been weighing on his mind. The emergence of the system did reduce some worries but still the main thing had to be done by him. He didn't have the luxury to slack.Sometimes he thinks it would be better if he knew nothing of the future.'No! I have atleast a fighting chance with foreknowledge I have,' he yelled at his lazy self.Without any further distraction, he fully concentrated on moving and breathing according to the knowledge he had gained earlier.As there was no fatigue and hunger, he gradually lost track of time. His mastery over the set of movements gradually increased until it reached perfection.[Manual Practice Progress: 100%] Getting the notification, Kent stopped. Looking at the screen, a huge smile bloomed on his face.He exited from the Simulation panel. The surroundings again change back to his room. Looking at the clock, he found that only 1 hour has passed in real world. According to the time ratio of 100:1, he spent about four days in the simulation space.Thinking about this, he was very excited. He wanted to practice the set movements in real life but remembering about how he pretended to be exhausted in front of his family, he gave up.'Well, I'll start exercising from tomorrow,' he decided. Now that he had achieved perfection in the simulation space, he had a feeling that he would make no mistake during practice in real life.The next morning, Kent woke very early. It was cold but the excitement that comes from doing something new overwhelmed the coldness of the weather. After taking care of hygiene, Kent changed to a set of comfortable clothes suitable for exercise.In the backyard, under the dim light of the dawn, Kent started practicing in a steady manner. After a while he found that the set of movement had become an Instinct to him.'So that's what system meant by perfection,' mused Kent as his movements become more rapid.After doing 3 rounds of continuous movement, Kent stopped. He was very exhausted.'First time exercising is always difficult,' he consoled himself.Taking a five minute rest, he again started practicing. This time he could do only 2 rounds of practice. After that he had no energy to move around.'I may have to optimize a nutritional drink tailor made for me,' Kent decided.As far as he was concerned, it was not very difficult to concoct a nutrition drink with help of the optimize function of the system, he only needed to record information on biology and chemistry.In fact he had already decided that he was going to record every "knowledge worthy" books from the libraries in the upcoming days. It might require years but he had time. He decided so because everytime he needed to find solutions to something new, he didn't need to run everywhere to collect data. Its far more convenient to have everything that you need, in your reach.Practicing for another half an hour, Kent went to shower.Despite the cold, his morning practice warmed him up enough to resist the chilly weather. The hot water from the geyser also helped.During breakfast...Mr. and Mrs. Granger was sitting side by side on one side of the square table, opposite to them on the other side of table, Kent and Hermione were sitting."Kent, why did you shower so early?" asked Mrs. Granger with a bit of concern.It was early December, the weather had already started to get colder than usual. Mrs. Granger was worried that Kent would catch a cold. She knew that Kent was far mature than his peers, so she found it unnecessary to reprimand him."It was because I had become sweaty after exercising," answered Kent."Hey Hermione, wanna do exercise with me– *cough*" Kent almost choked on his food."Eat before you talk!" chided Mrs. Granger."Okay okay," said Kent as he drank some water."Hmm, okay," Hermione nodded in response to Kent's offer."Good," Kent smiled.After being reborn in this world Kent had always been worrying about the future. As a result he didn't paid attention to Hermione. But still he noticed some peculiarities about Hermione, especially her maturity. He could clearly remember from the movie that although Hermione was brilliant but was never that mature.'Well, the fiction also didn't have a brother of Hermione,' mused Kent in his thoughts."Whatever," muttered Kent as he continued eating."Did you say anything?" asked Hermione who was sitting beside him."Nothing," responded Kent.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

It had been a month since Kent got the simulation system and he had never been happier.The set of optimized exercises that he got was far more magical than he thought. In only two weeks he could feel the difference. His stamina, speed, flexibility and reflex, everything had been enhanced. Additionally the nutrition drink he optimized using the system was a great supplement for his and Hermione's exercise.They both grew a few centimetres in the last month.It was impossible for Hermione to copy the the set of exercises to exact details as she didn't have the simulation system and also her physic was of a female, so there ought to be few deviation but the end result were pretty good.Hermione was also very happy and at the same time a bit shocked. Well, anybody ought to be shock when a set of pretty ordinary exercise could produce such magical result.In the past month, there had been another major thing that happened, that is, he and Hermione got along pretty well. Earlier she was a bit colder to him, to which Kent couldn't find any reason.Seeing the magical effect of the 'Optimization', Kent optimized another set of exercise just for wrist and finger movements. It was for easier and faster wand movement in the future. He didn't share it with Hermione as he couldn't say that he knew that they were magical and they would get Hogwarts letter on their 11th birthday.As for how Kent knew that he was a wizard, it was the leaky cauldron. No muggle would be able to see much less enter the leaky cauldron, but he could see and also enter. He didn't linger much as he didn't want to venture into the magical world without much protection.In addition to doing exercise daily and practicing the set of wrist movements Kent also kept recording any valuable books he got, Mathematics, Engineering, Computer Science, Electronics, Chemistry, Physics and Biology and also the auxiliary subjects like drawing, sculpting, designing and many more. He didn't need the knowledge at present but it might be required in the future. He also wanted to start early in the magical education but considering the risk of exposing himself to the magical world early, he gave up the thought.Well he didn't want to eat more than what he could chew.In the spare times, he searched particularly for books or any form of knowledge about runes, ancient relics, metaphysics and mythology and chinese qi(spirit) meditation available in the non-magical world. He wanted to develop a skill like 'danger sense', so that he could have a better chance at surviving the bleak future.He knew it would be difficult but that didn't stop him from trying. The first two trials ended in failure. When he set the desired function and purpose of the skill and selected the appropriate data from the 'Library', he got the notification that there was not enough relevant data.'Who knows how much knowledge I need to collect to develop the skill! Will I even be able to develop such skill? No! I can't give up!' Kent was in a dilemma. As there was no convenient mode of acquiring knowledge like Internet on a mobile or a laptop, it was pretty difficult to go around libraries and bookshops to collect the necessary data. It takes a lot of time.'Well, I will collect as much as possible in the spare time and after a year, I will try again to depelop the danger sense skill' he decided after some pondering.1 year later..."Finally, Lets hope that it will work this time," mumbled Kent. He was sitting on his bed with the door closed. It was nighttime, so it was unlikely that anyone would come but to be sure he locked the door from inside.Kent had collected as much as he could in the last year about metascience, mythology, runes etc.He opened the system page and clicked on the 'Optimize' option.ooo[Finalise what you want as an optimized output](Blank)[Select the data based on which you want to optimize the result](1.

It was because even if a piece of data was not relevant it would be excluded automatically.Its like if you want to develop a martial skill and select some data on martial arts and also data on how to cook, the system will still optimize the martial skill.After selecting the data, he specified the function of the skill, i.e., detect danger to oneself in advance including the direction in which the danger is coming. It would be disastrous if you know that danger is coming but don't know from where its coming.After rechecking all the entries, he hesitated for a moment but clenching his fist, he clicked submit."Fortunately!" Looking at the system screen, Kent sighed as if a heavy weight had been lifted off his shoulders.oooDeduce and OptimizeSlot[1] Advance danger sense [Estimated completion time 2 years 6 months 13 days]SimulationLibraryDownloadInventoryoooHe closed the system panel happily.Thinking about the future, it didn't take long before he fell asleep.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

Swish! Swish!Like a blur, Kent's hands and feet were moving in a synchronised pattern. The movements looked more like dance than martial arts.His right hand was holding a short stick like a baton.If a person looked closer, he would notice that Kent was manipulating the stick with just the index and middle finger. There wasn't even a hesitation. The movements were so fluid that the stick looked like an extra limb of the body, it was Kent's goal after all.For wizards and witches, wand is a vital part of their lives, a means to protect or destroy. As a person who knew the grim future of Harry Potter world, Kent was going to make sure that he would survive and his new family was safe from harm.For that he was doing his best. Doing exercise daily, drinking the 'not so tasty' nutrition fruit mix, reading and recording books or any form of useful data when he was free.Although the growth of his body was slowing down compared to the explosive growth in the first year after getting the system.He expected it and he was happy with it. It would be illogical to think that human body could grow indefinitely if given sufficient nutrients as well as doing exercises in a regular basis. There are other factors like growth hormones, genetic heredity, gravity etc. which influences the growth of human body.No matter how slow the growth was, Kent didn't give up. The martial art exercise was not just for the physical growth of the body but also stamina, speed, strength and flexibility. Although his body's growth had slowed down but the increase in the other attributes didn't slow down instead it sped up. He was now more in control of his own body. If he tried he could outperform most teenage athletes in their respective fields.Although Kent missed his adult body of his previous life but it was not that significant anymore. His new body was lot more flexible and stronger than his previous life's adult body. And he was gradually adapting to his new life as his previous life's memory was fleeting away like a breeze. Only the future plot of "Harry Potter" was intentionally recorded and memorized by him using the library and download function of the system.After exercising for an hour, he freshened up and drank the fruit mix he had prepared earlier. It had become a habit to keep extra two-three bottles of fruit mix in the freezer.Finishing the fruit mix, he went to his room without waking others up.Hermione had a headache yesterday night, so Kent decided to exercise today without her.Thinking about system, he was excited. He waited for nearly two and a half year for countdown of the 'Advance danger sense' skill to finish.There was only few minutes left before the optimization of the skill was completed.Closing the door of his room, he sat on his bed and opened the system panel. Although the panel was invisible to others but Kent always felt insecure opening the panel out in the open if not necessary.oooDeduce and OptimizeSlot[1] Advance danger sense [Complete]SimulationLibraryDownloadInventoryoooWithout any hesitation he opened the completed 'Advance danger sense' skill and downloaded the same into his memory. There was no headache or even a slight pain whatsoever in the process of influx of new information into his memory.He was speechless after getting the information of the danger sense skill. According to the manual, he needed to imagine a set of pattern and symbol that were so intricate and complex that he felt dizzy just looking at them. It was said in the manual that not only you have to memorize the array of pattern but also have to visualise it for a duration of five minutes every three hours and you have to do it until it becomes an instinct. Only after making it an instinct will the skill to be considered completely mastered.Fortunately the 'Download' function of the system helped him imprint the complex pattern in details into his memory otherwise he didn't know how he could memorise the said pattern much less visualise, it would take much longer than what he would hope for. But now that the first step, that is, the memorisation of the array of symbol was completed, he only needed to visualise it every three hours.He knew that it would be a lot harder than it sounds, like when he's in school or while he's sleeping.He closed the system panel and quietly lied on the bed. He didn't use the Simulation function of system because he knew it won't work. Whenever there is a practice involving the mind, the Simulation function would show error saying that system cannot control the user's mind.The error didn't disappoint him, rather it reduced Kent's little worry about the system. He didn't want to be puppet of the system after all.Dismissing the distracting thoughts Kent watched the white ceiling of his room and pondered about the schedule for the practice of visualisation. The most troublesome thing is visualisation during sleep and class.Although the array of pattern was etched into his memory but consciously visualising the said pattern is entirely a different thing.Nonetheless he had to do it.He sighed and got up from his bed. Tidying up his room he went downstairs.His father was reading newspaper while his mother was preparing breakfast. It was not surprising that his parents didn't call him as they knew that he was awake."Dad, Where's Hermione?" asked Kent from the stairs."She's sleeping," answered Mr. Granger as he put down the newspaper."Oh," said Kent as he turned back to go upstairs."Kent, don't wake her up, she needs rest," came his mother's voice from the kitchen."OK mom, I'll just check if she's alright," replied Kent."Make sure you don't disturb her," added Mr. Granger in a serious tone."I won't disturb her, I promise," said Kent as he went upstairs to Hermione's room.Quietly opening the door to Hermione's room Kent went in and saw that Hermione was panting heavily in her sleep and her face was flushed.'Somethings wrong,' without any hesitation Kent placed his hand on her forehead.'She's burning!' he exclaimed."Mom! Dad! Hermione's having a fever and it's very high," yelled Kent from Hermione's room.Kent's shout woke Hermione from her sleep."No! not Harry, noo, Ahhh," screamed Hermione as she abruptly sat up.'Harry?' Kent's expression froze for a moment before he was distracted by the sound of a pair of footsteps coming from outside the room.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

"Wha–?! Where am I?" asked Hermione looking around, confused and dazed."Calm down Hermione. You were having a nightmare," said Kent with a stiff expression. He still hadn't recovered from the previous shock.The door opened and Mr. and Mrs. Granger walked in.Seeing that his parents were already here, Kent made way for them."Let me check," said Mrs. Granger as she hurried forward.Putting her on Hermione's forehead she exclaimed, "You are burning, Hermione!""Dan, immediately call a doctor. Her temperature's too high," ordered Mrs. Granger."Uh, the phone's downstairs. Okay, you stay here. I'll be right back," said Mr. Granger as he hurried downstairs to make the phone call."Hermione, how are you feeling?" asked Mrs. Granger with concern."I... I feel a bit thirsty," answered Hermione weakly tilting her head sideways, confused."Kent–""Here Mom," Kent handed over a glass of water he had already prepared, to Mrs. Granger.Taking the glass, Mrs. Granger let Hermione drink slowly from the glass."Okay, you lie down a bit. I'll go get the thermometer," said Mrs. Granger."Mom you stay here, I'll go," Kent offered to help. Without waiting for her reply Kent went downstairs."It's in the cupboard beside the Kitchen's door," informed Mrs. Granger loudly."Yeah, I know," answered Kent who was already halfway through the stairs.It was 2 o'clock at noon when Hermione's fever subsided. The doctor prescribed some antibiotics and advised her to have some rest.There was nothing serious, at least, the Granger couple were told so.But Kent had different thoughts. If he remembered it correct, Hermione uttered the name "Harry" before she woke up.'It can't be a coincidence,' Kent didn't think it was just a coincidence. Kent knew that they didn't have any relatives by the name "Harry" and as far as Kent could recall they also never had classmate named "Harry".That could only mean that Hermione dreamt something about the future and it wasn't a pleasant dream from what he could infer from her panicked face and scream.'It seems that I can't overly rely on my foreknowledge. I can at most take it as reference. Nothing more,' closing his eyes he organised his thoughts."And I have to hurry up and master the danger sense skill," muttered Kent. After today's incident, he felt more insequre and uncertain about the future. His presence alone might've changed the trajectory of the lives of various people.'Hope that, history's the same as I know otherwise my exclusive knowledge about many important secrets may become useless,' he prayed silently."Okay whatever, it's better to think about the present," throwing away the unnecessary thoughts, he sat upright on his bed and took a deep breath."What?!" He tried visualising one corner of the pattern but found that he could not. No matter how hard he tried he couldn't visualise portions of the pattern separately.After few more tries, he realised that he had to picture the whole pattern in his mind, only then could he practice.Without any further delay, he concentrated on the pattern.He didn't notice it before but after a minute of constantly visualising the pattern, he had a feeling that he was going to grasp something, something that felt so close and yet at the same time, very far. It was an illusory feeling.He couldn't quite understand what was happening but instinctively he kept trying to understand.Forgetting the passage of time he kept visualising the array of patterns before he was snapped out of the vague state with a sharp headache.He immediately felt sluggish as if his body had run a marathon.'What happened?' Kent was scared.'Was it the array of pattern? How much time did I spend visualisation?' He looked at the clock."Sh*t! It's been half an hour already!" Kent shouted out loud before he put his hands on the mouth and looked toward the closed door of his room anticipating a scolding from his parents, especially his mother for the use of inappropriate word."Phew! It was close," getting no response from downstairs, he heaved a sigh of relief."I have to set an alarm next time, otherwise I would be too tired to do anything other than practicing visualisation," he muttered feeling the fatigue.At the dinner table...While eating, Kent subtly observed Hermione who looked a lot better than before.'Frequent glances toward mom, opening mouth for no reason, occasional clenching of fist, tapping on table. Hermione must be anxious to talk about something. Is it about the nightmare?' Kent came to a conclusion.Recently he had compiled a comprehensive book on human psychology and behaviour using the system.Kent had watched TV show in his previous life where a former CIA officer was introducing how one can identify if someone was lying and even can tell what a person is thinking just by looking at their body language or facial expressions. It was even possible to manipulate one's action using subtle psychological cues.So he also wanted to try.But what he didn't expect that his decision to compile the psychology book would bring him such a surprise. It was like a non-magical version of Legilimency."Hermione, how are you feeling now?" asked Kent trying to get her attention."Uh, I'm okay," answered Hermione absent mindedly.Not getting Hermione's attention, Kent decided to test something."Harry Potter," said Kent."Wha- cough, cough," Hermione choked on her food.'I was right!' Kent cheered mentally."Here, have some water," Mrs. Granger who was sitting beside Hermione handed her the glass of water."Kent, don't talk while you're eating," chided Mrs. Granger in a stern voice, glaring at him."Sorry mom," apologised Kent meakly lowering his head. But his eyes were still on Hermione, secretly observing her body language and expression.It didn't take long before their eyes met.Kent gave a knowing smile to her curious and questioning look."We'll talk later, in the morning," said Kent as he passed by Hermione on the way to his room. It was a soft whisper audible enough to be heard by Hermione.She nodded after a slight hesitation.The brother-sister interaction remained unnoticed by the Granger couple who were discussing whether to open the clinic tomorrow.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

The next morning, Kent woke up a bit later than usual. The mental fatigue caused by the visualisation of the pattern for half an hour had far more serious consequences than he thought.'Next time I have to be more careful,' he thought while his hands and feet were moving gracefully in a coordinated fashion.After three years of daily practice he didn't need to consciously think about moving his body anymore while practicing the set of martial arts. It had become an instinct.But after practicing for so long, he also had started to notice some obvious shortcoming of his practice.At first when he optimized the set of exercises he mainly focused on shaping his body to have more stamina, flexibility and speed. It was oriented toward dodging and escaping rather than attack.As a result he lacked a proper means of combat.It wasn't that having high stamina and flexibility wouldn't help him attacking his opponents but there was a huge difference between having only speed and having both speed and a proper combat tactics. Because its quite impossible to make decisions for every attack you do with conscious mind as it would make your movements slower and predictable.So he decided to compile and optimize a set of melee combat tactics which also included the use of dagger.Fortunately he had accumulated huge amount of data in the library of the system.It took only half an hour to deduce and optimize the melee combat tactics."Kent, freshen up. Breakfast is ready," suddenly his mother's voice sounded from inside the house.'Mom's already awake?' Kent questioned himself before he realised–"Oops I forgot, I woke up late today," muttered Kent tapping his forehead."Okay mom," replied Kent loudly.After a short discussion during breakfast it was decided that Mr. Granger would be going to the clinic while Mrs. Granger would be staying at home.Although Hermione's fever had gone down and she was in normal condition but still Mrs. Granger insisted on staying home, just to be sure.Hermione and his mother was sitting on the sofa and watching the television when suddenly Hermione stood up."Mom, I'm going upstairs to Kent's room," informed Hermione.She was still anxious about yesterday's matter, how did Kent know about 'Harry Potter'?'Did I talk while sleeping?' Hermione thought as she hurried upstairs."Don't run on the stairs," chided Mrs. Granger."Okay mom," Hermione was already on the 1st floor by the time she slowed down.Kent just finished the practice of visualisation of the pattern when he heard a knock on the door.He looked at clock sitting the desk beside his bed and noted down the time. After three hours, he would have to practice again.He opened the door to see that Hermione was standing there."Why was your door locked?" asked Hermione as her eyes roamed around the room looking for clues to what Kent was doing.She was disappointed that she couldn't find anything worth noting."I was just meditating," chuckled Kent looking at Hermione's behaviour."Do you want to become a monk or something?" asked Hermione jokingly."Who knows?""Well, let's get down to business," said Kent seriously as he took out a pile of paper from the drawer of the desk.Placing the pile of paper on the bed, Kent asked, "You want to know how I know the name 'Harry Potter', right?"Hermione nodded and sat on the bed, looking curious at the papers placed on the bed. They looked like parchment paper.Kent dragged the chair to the side of the bed where he put papers and sat on it."But before that," Kent took a deep breath and asked,"Do you think magic exists?""What?!"Hermione was taken aback by the sudden question."How did you–""Guess, right?" Kent handed her the top most paper from the pile. There was a realistic drawing of a series of boats with four kids each floating towards a magnificent castle illuminated with lamps, under the night sky."Where did you get picture?" asked Hermione staring intently at the drawing.'Looks like she recognised it,' Kent guessed looking at the subtle changes in Hermione's expression.Kent had drawn the pictures yesterday night just to check whether Hermione had clear memories or visions of the future or just some occasional visions. As for Hermione being from future, he was not very sure. Kent had observed her for the last three months but couldn't find anything that would indicate that she was from future."I drew it," chuckled Kent and handed over the rest of the drawings, "also look at these."Hermione took the parchments. Putting the rest back on her side, she unfolded the one at the top. It was a considerably small compared to the others.Unfolding the paper, she saw the sketch of a huge man in shabby clothes holding an equally large umbrella. Most of his face was covered in beard which reached down to his belly."Hagrid," she whispered subconsciously tracing the drawing with her index finger. She didn't notice that Kent was looking at her closely.Her whisper only solidified Kent's guess that Hermione not only dreamt of future but also she could recall the content of the dream.Putting aside the picture of Hagrid, she picked up the next one.Looking at the sketch of a classroom, she frowned. It was of a classroom where students dressed in robes were paired together and there were cauldrons placed in front of them. A man with long hair was standing in front of them holding a short stick. Kent had perfectly portrayed the professor's serious and gloomy expression.Hermione looked a bit uncomfortable when looking at the man. This time she didn't whisper anything but looking at her expression Kent knew that she recognised the man.She soon moved on to next picture. One by one she picked up the drawings and watched them silently.Finished looking at the pictures, Hermione took a deep breath and said one word, "How do you know?""Hermione, in the beginning I asked you that if you believed that magic exists, right?"Hermione nodded."I also believe magic exists and I also believe that we both have magic powers.""But–""Don't be in a hurry do deny it." Kent interrupted her and continued speaking."You remember that in our fifth birthday when cousin Sally teased you about your front teeth and suddenly a book was flung from the shelf toward her,"Looking straight to her eyes Kent asked, "What do you think, caused the phenomenon?"Clearly remembering the incident, Hermione was stumped by Kent's questions."But, It could be wind or–""Do you really think that wind would have such an accuracy that it only flung the book without disturbing other things and most of all there wasn't even strong wind or storm at that time." argued Kent."Okay, let's just say that the incident was a coincidence but what about our dream.""Yes, I also had dreams about the castle and the classrooms and many more," Kent admitted. Looking at her unbelievable expression, he argued, "How do you think I drew those pictures?"There was a brief silence. Kent sighed and stood up."You probably heard about fortune telling, right?" Kent went to desk and picked up a book on metascience on Divination and gave it to Hermione."What if, the dreams we had were from future?" Kent voiced his thoughts and without giving Hermione a chance to argue back, he continued to speak."It sounds unbelievable, right? I also didn't believe it at first but there are some places I recognised from the dream. One of them is 'Leaky cauldron'. It's a shabby pub on the Charing Cross road. I also visited the place and saw the same kind of people with robes and wands. I even saw them levitating objects," explained Kent although the last part was a lie. He didn't see someone levitating objects. He just made that up.Hermione's expression brightened up."I think magical people or better call them wizards, they might have magic to turn away any non-magical people that's why we don't hear anything about them and the reason I could see them, I guess that I might be magical as well.""I also think the magical world might be dangerous," Kent took out some other papers that were in his pockets and unfolded them one by one.There were drawings of huge snake, a huge creature with a small head carrying a big club, three headed dogs, giant spider."Basilisk, Trolls, Cerberus, Acromantula. I have seen them in my dreams. The Basilisk can kill a person with–"Interrupting Kent in the middle of his talk Hermione explained the rest of it, "–its eyes and if a person looks at them through a reflection they become petrified,""And according to what I remember from my dreams, I was petrified by looking at its through a mirror." confessed Hermione.'I might be wrong about her. She knows more than I thought. Did she get memories from the future without affecting her personality?' thought Kent confused by the contradictory fact that Hermione's personality remained the same even with rather complete memories from the future.'Or her personality is same as that of the future? My impression of her may be biased due to my previous life's memorie–'"What happened?" Hermione' s voice woke him from his thoughts."Yes, as I was saying, the magical world is dangerous. So it's better not to venture into the world without sufficient protection." Kent voiced his thoughts."Yes, I know. I had a nightmare yesterday about the man with pale sickly complexion. He called himself V-Voldemort. H-he ki-killed–"Hermione started panicking."Hermione! calm down. That could really just be nightmare," said Kent snapping her out of panicked state.Hermione quickly composed herself."Okay, now that you are calm. Let's talk about the future,""If what we saw in our dreams are accurate then we better prepare ourselves for the worst and I think its better not to inform our parents about this. They might not believe us or even if they did, what we saw was not something our parent can handle," suggested Kent."Hmm," nodded Hermione agreeing with Kent.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

After another few minutes of discussion with Kent, Hermione came out.Without looking back she ran to her room and shut the door tightly.She couldn't hold it in anymore.Inside the familiar walls of her room, she finally let go of her pretence.Kent would be surprised seeing her like this. He wouldn't have thought that occlumency was more than just protecting your mind from legilimency.Thinking about the future, Hermione's expression turned sad and nostalgic. It looked like she had gone through countless vicissitudes of life. Her eyes gradually moistened with drops of tears rolling down her cheeks.It was hard, even for a highly skilled occlumens like her. Keeping her real self under the vineer of a childish personality was harder than she anticipated, especially after seeing those familiar faces, remembering the joyous times, the sad times and mostly the last two years of her life in the future. She along with Harry were under the constant hunt of the dark lord's underlings before she died under the curse of the said dark lord.Hermione was indeed from future. She didn't know how she returned to the past after dying but she was happy that she got a chance to correct the countless mistakes and wrong decisions she made in her life.But there was a single variable in all this. It was her brother.Kent Granger didn't exist in the future. As far as she could recall she was the single daughter of her parents.It didn't just end there. Kent was far mysterious than she thought at first.First of all, he was far more intelligent and mature than what a kid of his age should be even if he was a genius. Maturity and knowledge just don't come out of nowhere. It comes with experience.Kent was also more confident and sure of himself which is generally seen in adults.She had a guess that Kent might be same as her, that is, adult consciousness inside a child's body.Her suspicion deepened after their fifth birthday.He had came up with a set of martial arts which "could" shape the body to it's fullest "potential". She didn't take it seriously at first but as an excuse to observe him more closely, she decided to accept Kent's offer and exercise with him. He even came up with a nutrition drink, although it tasted bad but it was better than those potions she drank in her Hogwarts years.But within a week, she got an unexpected surprise. The combination of the exercise and the nutrition drink worked like a charm. She could literally feel the changes it brought to her body. Although it might not be as instantaneous as those potions but it felt more natural.And within one year, her physic changed from a normal girl to an athlete's or even better.This also deepened the mystery of her brother.Sometimes she was tempted to use legilimency on him but her moral integrity stopped her from doing so. Although during the war against Voldemort, she had picked up the rudimentary legilimency skill but it was rough and rude. It wasn't as subtle as of those highly skilled like Dumbledore.And more importantly, Kent wasn't her enemy.She never felt threatened living with Kent under same roof. Instead she felt a little safer and she tended to believe her intuition more than her eyes, the war had demanded so. When friends as close as your brother abondon you and betrays you for comforts of life, you've got to develop some skills.But she wasn't sure if he knew about magic though.But her doubt was soon cleared one year after her fifth birthday when Kent suddenly started practicing the same martial arts but with a short stick in his hand.She had watched him carefully during the practice and noticed his graceful manipulation of the stick with his fingers.It was also one of the reason Hermione staged such a scene yesterday about her nightmare. Accidentally revealing the name 'Harry' in front of Kent.Another reason was, she wanted to know if Kent was indeed from the future.Today's incident confirmed her guess.He was indeed from the future. She didn't believe any of his "visions seen in dreams" excuses. The portrait of Hagrid, the drawings of Hogwarts castle, potion classroom. Even the gloomy expression on Snape's face was spot on.Divination was much more complicated and vague than that. As far she knew all the prophecies were vague.She had to admit that her brother's drawing skills were superb.'It makes things easier and also a lot more complicated than before,' Hermione sighed.Easier in the sense that Kent's biological age was same as her and mentally he was also an adult like her. She could at least relate to someone in her age group, be it her brother.And it was harder in the sense that she wasn't sure if they were the only ones who came back from the future. And also which future did Kent come from? The parallel universe theories are pretty complicated.Putting away the distracting thoughts, Hermione pondered, 'maybe I should teach him occlumency.'But she immediately scrapped that idea.'No! I need to observe him more,'It was not that she suspected Kent was an enemy but on careful thought, she found that she didn't know him as well as she believed.She was also sure that he hid many things from her just like she hid many things from him.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

The last six months were hard for Kent. It was mainly because of the practice of visualisation.He had clearly underestimated the difficulties. He couldn't always carry an alarm clock with him, could he? Like in class. It was also difficult to wake up in the middle of the night to practice. He hadn't had a proper sleep in the last six months.He was reprimanded by his teacher more than once for being distracted during the class.It was also tiring to practice it every three hours. He found that although he followed the instructions as best as he could, he still felt tired at the end of the day. This also increased his calories intake. He even drank the nutrition mix more than once a day. Fortunately his parents were dentists. It would be difficult for a normal family to bear the cost.In the end, his hard work had paid off. After the first three months of struggle, he immediately felt the changes. His perception of the surroundings had subtly changed. He noticed many small and insignificant things that he would usually ignore.The knowledge of psychology and his enhanced observations complemented each other. He could more or less predict what a ordinary person's gonna do in the next moment. It was a magical feeling.Also after the first three months of practice, he had basically grasped the schedule.He no longer needed to close his eyes to visualise and concentrate and he also could wake up on time to practice, during the night.This also increased the efficiency of his practice and it only took another three months to partially master the danger sense skill.Whenever there was a danger, he would feel a slight stinging sensation and immediately know the direction it was coming from. It was pretty similar to the 'spider sense' of spiderman.The only shortcoming was that he had to stay vigilant for his danger sense skill to work. That's why he believed that he hadn't completely mastered the skill as said in the manual – only after making it an Instinct the skill could be considered mastered. He was confident that he would be able to do so within a year."Stare at this pattern for a minute," Kent said to Hermione, showing her a pattern drawn on a piece of squared parchment.It was exactly the same pattern which Kent had practiced visualisation for the past six months. After mastering the skill, he found that he could visualise portions of the pattern separately. That gave him the idea of drawing it on a parchment and then show it to Hermione and see if it works or not.At first he was reluctant to share it with Hermione but after the incident involving her nightmare, they became very close, occasionally sharing things about the future they "saw" in their "dreams".After considering the future troubles, Kent felt it was silly and impractical to shoulder all the responsibilities alone when you have a smart sister who knows about the future.So Kent decided to share it with Hermione. The skill, if Hermione could master, would become a vital part of their fighting strength against the "dark lord".His art skills, which he had to spend countless hour in the simulation space to master, had helped him in his endeavour.There were few differences though, between the pattern on the paper and what he had in his memory.It was really impossible to copy the intricate pattern to the minute details. But he found it was pretty effective after testing it. He just wanted to know if it would work on Hermione.Hermione looked at pattern and asked, "what is this?"She was puzzled looking at the gibberish pattern which made no sense to her."Don't be distracted, just look at the whole pattern and try to concentrate on it as much as possible," said Kent.Seeing Hermione's hesitation, Kent persuaded, "just try it, you will be surprised.""Okay, if you say so," Hermione finally agreed.After only few seconds of staring at the pattern she went into a trance.'So, it also works on others,' thought Kent looking at Hermione who was standing in a daze looking toward the pattern on the parchment which was stuck on the wall.'It's almost three minutes,' He looked at the clock and decided to wake her up."Hermione, Hermione," Kent shook her shoulders.Hermione woke up from her trance with a gasp as if she was deprived of air."Are you okay?" asked Kent with concern.Adjusting her breathing, Hermione exclaimed out loud, "what just happened?!""After looking at the pattern, you went into a trance for three minutes straight," replied Kent as he sat down on his bed and continued, "no worries, I was also in a trance when I tried it for the first time,"Without waiting for her to speak, Kent asked, "Do you remember the feeling when you were in a trance?"The question made Hermione thoughtful. Thinking quietly for a moment, she answered, "I can't quite accurately describe it but it felt like I was going to comprehend something. It-it was like... when you read the first few sentence of an essay and think that you understand what's the whole essay is about but the next few sentences make you realise that you didn't actually understand anything. This process goes on. It was so frustrating!""Good analogy," Kent nodded thoughtfully."What is that pattern?" asked Hermione."I don't know myself," admitted Kent truthfully. He really didn't know. It was the system that deduced and optimised the pattern from lots of information collected over an year by him. It would take a lot of time– which he didn't have, to search through the library of the system to find the source."Where did you get it?" asked Hermione."Well, let's just say, lots of knowledge and a powerful mind." Kent gave her a vague answer."Okay, putting away the unimportant questions," said Kent not caring if Hermione was dissatisfied. The system was his biggest secret which he didn't want anyone other than himself to know about."You see if you visualise that pattern for five minutes in the interval of three hours, you would develop a skill which will help you sense danger in advance," explained Kent concisely.Looking at her expression, Kent laughed and asked, "You don't believe me?"Hermione nodded frankly. Although the pattern was quite mysterious but it was still unbelievable to think just by visualising the said pattern, one would develop the skill to sense danger."Flying brooms, dragons, unicorn, talking portrait and magic itself is an impossible thing but they still exist, so why can't the fact that the piece of pattern on the parchment can help develop a intuitive sense of danger be possible," argued Kent.Kent then suddenly thought of something and looked under his bed."You may not believe my words but you have to believe your eyes" said Kent suddenly as he pulled out a plastic bag containing three tennis balls."Lets go to the backyard.""Tennis balls? What do you want to do with tennis balls?" asked Hermione on the way."You'll see," said Kent as they soon reached the backyard of their house."Okay, you hold this for a sec," Kent handed over the plastic bag to Hermione.He walked to the centre of the yard.Then he took out a piece of black cloth and covered his eyes with it."Hermione, throw the tennis balls toward me. Aim for my chest or head, wherever you want. Just throw with the intention of hurting me," Kent instructed."Did he really mastered the danger sense skill?" Hermione muttered. She finally understood what Kent wanted to do but she was still skeptical whether Kent's words were true.'Whatever, let's see if Kent can really dodge the balls while blindfolded,' Hermione took out one of the tennis ball from bag and put rest back to the ground."Here I come," Hermione threw the first ball aiming for Kent's shoulder. As she was standing really close to Kent, about ten meters away, the aim was pretty correct.The ball went straight toward Kent's right shoulder.But when it was just about one foot away from Kent, he jumped sideways to his left. The ball hit the fence on the back missing him completely.'It must be a fluke. He probably heard my voice and dodged the ball,' Hermione concluded and to prove herself right, she picked the next ball quietly and walked sideways to her left. Aiming for Kents abdomen, she threw the ball. This time, the ball was faster.But the result was the same. Kent dodged the ball at last moment by jumping sideways to his right.She was still not reconciled.Picking up the last ball, she threw it with all her strength."Oops," She gasped as soon as the ball left her hand. Due to her using full strength, the aim was a bit off. She wanted to aim for his shoulder but the ball went straight toward his face.But similar to the first two tries, Kent dodged the ball in the last moment just by ducking his head."You must be cheating," Hermione ran toward Kent to check whether he had properly covered his eyes. Even after seeing the cloth tightly wrapped around his eyes Hermione remained skeptical."This time I will tie it around your eyes. Let's see if you can still dodge," said Hermione as she untied the blindfold."Okay, whatever you wish," Kent laughed. He was having fun seeing Hermione so frustrated and flustered.After making sure the blindfold wasn't transparent, Hermione tied the blindfold back around his eyes. She even made sure that it covered both of his eyes completely."Are you happy now?" Kent sighed helplessly."Let's see if you can laugh after this time," Hermione said as she picked up the three balls and went back to her position.The first ball went straight toward his leg, Kent jumped and dodged it. The second one went straight towards his lower abdomen, Kent turned ninety-degrees to his right allowing it to pass and missing him completely.The last one was difficult. Hermione walked forward quietly until she was only a few meters away from Kent. She threw the ball fast and hard straight toward the middle of his chest. The aim was perfect this time. Kent responded to this one a bit differently. He caught the ball with his right hand while his left hand was on the back.Throwing the ball back to Hermione, Kent untied the blindfold and asked, "So, how was it? Still don't believe?""Can you sense any kind of danger? Like... like if someone is in front of you and pretending to be all friendly but he actually want to harm you. Can you detect the danger?" Hermione couldn't help but ask."I haven't tried it but it should work. If you can master the skill, you will feel a slight stinging sensation when you are in danger and also know the direction its coming from." answered Kent expressing his thoughts.It had only been a few days that Kent had mastered the danger sense skill. He still hadn't have the time to experiment with it properly.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

When Kent decided to share the pattern with Hermione, he didn't expect anything in return. He just wanted a capable ally against the future enemies.But who knew Hermione would offer something that he was in dire need of before going to Hogwarts.It's Occlumency.Kent had been worried that his secrets might be exposed if someone used legilimency on him. To counter the problem, he had compiled a comprehensive method of organising his thoughts and protecting his mind from outside influences, but he was pretty sure that against legilimency it won't be effective.So he really wanted to learn Occlumency. But even if he ventured into magical world, it was doubtful if he could get books or instructions on Occlumency. It was pretty obscure and valuable knowledge.Hermione solved the problem.After seeing the effectiveness of the danger sense skill, Hermione felt a little guilty about hesitating to teach Occlumency to Kent.From Hermione's perspective, the danger sense skill was equally valuable as the Occlumency skill."Here, I have written all the steps and instructions I remember about Occlumency practice," Hermione handed over a notebook, half-an-inches thick, to Kent. She was sure that after today, Kent would probably suspect that she's from the future. But still Hermione didn't hesitate because, like Kent, Hermione was also investing on a future ally.Opening the notebook, Kent skimmed over the content and he was baffled by it.'How much does she remember?!' exclaimed Kent in his thoughts. Considering the thickness of the notebook, Hermione had probably written over a hundred pages of content."Ah, I almost forgot," Kent suddenly remembered something and said, "okay, wait here for a moment,"He ran out of the room in a hurry.When he came back to Hermione's room, he had a small bracelet with him.He showed the bracelet to Hermione. It was a plain bracelet with a small red button on the top.He clicked on the button and a small squared card slid out from the side of the bracelet. It contained the pattern that Kent showed her earlier. To make visualisation more convenient for Hermione, Kent had carefully drawn the pattern on the small card and constructed a bracelet with sliding mechanism to put it inside.He then put the card back into the bracelet and handed the bracelet to Hermione."Remember, it is dangerous to visualise the pattern for more than five minutes. So be careful." Kent warned her about the danger of visualising the pattern. He had experienced the danger himself when he first tried it."It would be better if you do it in my presence for the first few days," Kent offered to help."Okay," Hermione agreed without hesitation. She was well aware of the danger. If Kent hadn't woke her up during her first try, she might not be able to wake from the trance.Days went by as Hermione started to notice the changes brought about by visualisation of the pattern.After the first few months of visualising under the supervision of Kent, she found that she could recall the pattern in her mind and it was as effective as the one drawn on the card.This also made the practice more convenient and easy.The only problem was that her progress was a bit slow.It wasn't that she wasn't deligent enough.The problem stemmed from the imperfections of the pattern drawn by Kent.That didn't make her lose confidence though, because however small the improvement was, it was happening. She had become more observant. She had started to notice things she usually ignore especially as a witch.Her perception of magic had improved ever so slightly and it was still improving.Kent wasn't idle either during the time.After getting the step by step instructions on Occlumency from Hermione, Kent had read the whole notebook.The process of practicing Occlumency was not much different from the meditation guide he had compiled using the system. The difference was that Occlumency required the person to make his or her mind blank and empty, devoid of emotions. It sounds easy but practicing the discipline required great control over one's emotion.He modified the meditation guide he had been following for the last five years. He just chose all the information related to meditation and also included the content of the notebook that Hermione gave him.He specified the main function as being able to repel any kind of mental intrusion.It took about three days for the system to deduce and optimize the guide. He named it 'Guide to Occlumency'. He memorised the whole manual using the download function of the library.Practicing Occlumency was harder than the visualisation process. It was boring and monotonous.But the changes it brought kept him going on. He was a lot calmer. It also brought positive changes to his other practices.He was hopeful that after mastering Occlumency he would be less prone to panic when faced with unexpected situations.The process of Visualisation had also become a lot more effective.It was a chilly, Sunday morning.Two teenagers were sitting on the sofa, a boy and a girl.Looking at them, it felt like looking at two scholars, refined and disciplined.The boy was Kent Granger and the girl was Hermione Granger.It was difficult to recognize the girl as she had straightened her distinctively bushy hairs.They would occasionally glance outside the window overlooking the front yard as if waiting for someone.Today was a special day for both of them. It was 19 September 1990, their 11th birthday and also the day they would probably receive their Hogwart's acceptance letter.They didn't have to wait long as they soon saw a middle aged woman walking toward the door. She was wearing emerald green robes and a black pointed hat with feathers stuck in the brim.

Minerva McGonagall was the deputy headmistress of Hogwarts, Head of Gryffindor House and also the professor who taught transfiguration.But despite having all those high positions and the corresponding responsibilities, she would always make time every year for the special occasion, that is, introducing muggleborn witches or wizards to magical world.She tries her best to make it as comfortable as she could, for the muggle family to accept magic and send their child to Hogwarts.She was pretty surprised this morning, when she looked up the Hogwart's directory where the name and address of the wizards and witches who are eligible to attend Hogwarts, were recorded.It was quite rare for muggle household to have two magical children at the same time.It was at 9 o'clock when she reached the Granger residence.Ringing the doorbell twice, she waited."Kent, look who's at the door," came a female voice from the house."Okay mom," answered a boy.Soon she heard a pair of footsteps.A brown haired boy opened the door."Who are you?" the boy asked."I am Minerva McGonagall, a professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry," she introduced herself.Looking at the puzzle expression of the boy, she chuckled and said, "it'd be better if you call you parents.""So, you are saying that magic is real and both of my children are magical," asked Mrs. Granger with an unbelievable expression."Madam, I think you need to see a doctor," remarked Mr. Granger in the middle."Dan, don't be rude," Mrs. Granger sternly warned Mr. Granger."It's alright," Professor McGonagall smiled. She was not offended by Mr. Granger's rude words. She deals with similar things every year."A demonstration would dispel your doubts, I hope?" offered professor McGonagall."If you can, that is," rebuked Mr. Granger.Professor McGonagall waved the wand in her right hand and tapped twice on the tea cup sitting on the table. The moment the tip of the wand touched the cup for the second time, it changed into a breathing, living bird.The Granger couple were shocked seeing the tea cup turned into bird. The whole thing happened in front of their eyes leaving them no chance to rebute her claim.On the side, Kent was looking curiously at professor's demonstration. It was the first time he had seen magic right in front of him. He had already activated the record function of the system library. As said in the introductions, the system records informations in any form, be it pictorial or written.After introducing the Granger family to the wonders of the magical world and informing them of the advantages of magical education, the professor produced two envelopes from her robes and handed them to Mrs. Granger."There is a list of all necessary books and equipment inside the envelope along with the letter," added the professor."You don't have to decide immediately." reminded professor McGonagall seeing the parent's hesitation and continued, "but I hope that you will allow your children to attend Hogwarts as it can be very dangerous for your children if they don't learn to control their magic powers.""There will be a post owl waiting for your reply," she reminded them.After coming out of the house, professor McGonagall dissappeared as if squeezed into nothingness.It didn't take long for the Granger couple to reach a decision.After a bit of thinking and discussion, considering the danger of not learning how to control magical powers, it was decided that Kent and Hermione would attend Hogwarts.After getting the positive response from the Granger family, professor herself decided to be their guide to buy required books and equipment in Diagon Alley.It was 11 o'clock when professor McGonagall picked them up. They travelled to the Charing Cross road using non-magical transport as she knew that it would be uncomfortable for the Granger family to travel using "Apparition" – a rather convenient magical teleportation skill."This is one of oldest pub in London, 'The Leaky Cauldron'. It is also the entrance to Diagon Alley where we are going to buy the supplies," Professor McGonagall opened the worn out grey door sandwiched between a book shop and a record store. It was situated in such conspicuous place but most people walking by didn't even glance at it.The Granger family followed her in.The moment they stepped in, they felt the change in atmosphere. It was like they travelled back to Victorian age. The pub was a bit dingy and dark. It was dimly lit with candles. Their presence didn't cause any changes in the lively atmosphere of the pub."Hello Professor McGonagall. Hogwart's students?" asked the bartender politely sizing up the two teens following behind the professor."Yes Tom," said the professor with stern face. There was a significant change in her attitude from when she talked with Granger family.Soon they followed the professor into a chilly courtyard surrounded by brick wall.The wall on the front had a few bricks missing from the centre.'It was made purposefully,' Kent concluded looking at the groove.Professor McGonagall took out her wand and tapped on the bricks around the groove in sequence.Kent memorised the position of the bricks as well as the sequence of the tapping.Soon on the fifth tap, the bricks started rearranging itself.The professor stepped back.The bricks pulled away by itself forming an archway leading to a street bursting with people wearing long hats and robes.If entering the pub was like traveling back in time to the Victorian age then entering Diagon Alley was like stepping into a whole new world.Kent deeply wished at the time that he was taller. The streets were so densely packed that it was very difficult for him to see the shops. He could only see the top of buildings that were slightly tilted toward the street."We will first go to Gringotts to change the muggle money to wizarding currency," said professor McGonagall."What is Gringotts, professor? Is it a Bank?" asked Kent."Yes it is the largest bank in wizarding world. It is run by goblins," answered professor McGonagall."Stay close to me," said the professor looking at the overcrowded street.On the way to the Gringotts bank, Kent would occasionally glance around him as if looking for something.'Looks like she can't feel it,' thought Kent as he took a glance at Hermione.From the moment he had entered Diagon Alley, he could feel a slight stinging sensation throughout his body. He knew that it was his danger sense that was warning him. Although it was very faint but still dangerous.So he would occasionally glance back or sideways to determine the source.Instead of finding out the source, he found a pretty significant flaw of his danger sense skill. It was very difficult to find the source of danger in an overcrowded area."Hermione, I felt slight danger a few seconds ago," Kent whispered to Hermione.Her muscle tightened on hearing Kent's words."I think what I sensed was hostility. But its better to be careful though," added Kent.Hermione nodded. If it was really dangerous she would've also felt it. Her sense were less sensitive or it would be better to say that Kent's senses were too sharp.'Looks like we reached the bank,' thought Kent as his eyes fell on a very tall white building with "GRINGOTTS BANK" written in bold letters on the front balcony structure.The whole building was made of white jade stone. The design was a bit trippy though, not that it was ugly but the whole building was asymmetrical.They entered the bank through a burnished bronze door followed by small entrance hall and another set of doors made of silver."Enter, stranger, but take heedOf what awaits the sin of greed,For those who take, but do not earn,Must pay most dearly in their turn.So if you seek beneath our floorsA treasure that was never yours,Thief, you have been warned, bewareOf finding more than treasure there, "Kent read the warning engraved on the silver door."It is the safest place in the world for safekeeping your money and valuables, expect for Hogwarts, that is," said Professor McGonagall with pride. It was difficult to discern whether she was proud of Gringotts or Hogwarts or it was both.Passing through the door, they reached marble Hall.'They don't look much different from what I had in my mind,' Kent thought seeing the hundred or so Goblins sitting at the counters. They were short with pointed beard and equally pointed nose and ears. Their fingers and feet were very long.After changing few thousand pounds to galleons, they followed professor McGonagall to Madam Malkin's to buy robes and hats for Kent and Hermione.It took a bit of time to fit them for their robes separately. After that they went straight to Flourish and Blotts bookstore located next to Madam Malkin's shop.The inside of bookstore was bigger compared to what they saw from outside.It was filled with shelves stacked to the ceiling.Looking at so many books, Kent had a urge to just record each and every book using the system library. Unfortunately, It was not the right time and the manager probably wouldn't allow him.They bought only one copy of each book in the list that was included in the envelope alongside the Hogwarts letter.Kent and Hermione had suggested that it would be wasteful to buy same books for them separately as they could just share it. The professor also supported the decision.Except for the Hogwarts textbooks, they also bought some other books which included books about the history of magical world like the one titled "Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century" and "The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts", a book on potion making and the theory behind it and also an encyclopedia about different magical plants and fungi.As it was not allowed for them to practice magic in "muggle world" except for special cases, so Kent decided that in the remaining time before they attended Hogwarts, he would make full use of the system and learn the "subtle art of making potions" as Snape would call it and if possible, try to come up with new useful recipes using the optimization function of the system.After buying the other necessary supplies like cauldron and telescope, they headed down the alley to buy wands for Kent and Hermione.Passing by a pet shop, they stopped in front of an old shop with an window display consisting of a single wand resting on a faded purple cushion."Olivander's, Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C," read Kent looking at the words inlaid with gold.The family of four followed the professor into the shop. There was a chime of the bell when the professor opened the door.The shop was quiet and had a dusty feeling to it.There were thousands of narrow boxes piled right up to the ceiling.'Do all of them contain Wands or they were just for show?' Kent wondered."Minerva McGonagall, nine and a half inch, Fir, dragon heartstring. Buying wand for new students?" said an old man who appeared from behind a shelf stacked with boxes containing wands."Yes Mr. Ollivander," she said and pointed toward the two teens standing beside her, "Mr and Ms. Granger will be buying their wands,""Ah, first generation, I see. eh?" Mr. Olivander suddenly felt something and looked back."Oh my! Is it...?" muttered Mr. Ollivander as he hurried to the room at back of the store.The family of four was shocked at his odd behaviour, professor McGonagall wasn't an exception. It was first time she had seen Mr. Ollivander so excited and she had visited the shop many times as a guide to muggleborn witches and wizards."I'll be! It is the third time, I am observating this phenomenon in my shop!" Mr. Ollivanders came out from the room with a cream coloured box in his hand. The box was occasionally producing sparks of red and gold."What happened, Mr. Ollivander?" Kent asked Mr. Olivander looking curiously at the oddly sparkling box."Vine wands do tend to produce magical effect in presence of a suitable owner and I think I just know who it is," said Mr. Ollivander looking at Hermione who was looking at the box in a daze.He opened the box, took out a yellowish wand about ten inch long and handed it to Hermione.The moment Hermione hold the wand, it produced a final bright spark of red before returning to normal."Quite a strong reaction," Mr. Ollivander looked curiously at Hermione before he turned his attention to Kent."Which one's your dominant hand?" asked Mr. Ollivander."Right. I am right handed, sir," answered Kent.Mr. Ollivander produced a measuring tape from his pocket and took a rough measurement of Kent's right hand."Ah, I know just the right wand for you," said Mr. Ollivander as he walked back to shelves.Soon he came back with a black box in his hand."Ten and a half inch made of Ebony wood with dragon heartstrings as it's core," He handed a dark brown coloured wand to Kent.There was no special effect whatsoever when Kent held the wand. He also didn't feel anything different."Give it a wave," instructed Mr. Ollivander.Kent did so aiming toward the shelves on the front."Hmm...?" Kent felt a familiar sensation passing through his spine towards his right hand the moment he waved the wand.But soon he was snapped out of his stupor both by his mother's voice and the sound of boxes falling on the ground."Be careful, Kent!" Mrs. Granger scolded her son and ordered him to apologise to the shopkeeper for making a mess."I am very sorry, Mr. Ollivander," apologised Kent sincerely and put the wand on the counter."No worries. This happens all the time and they are just a spell away from being sorted into the right place," said Mr. Ollivander light and flicked his original wand toward the fallen boxes. In the next moment the boxes flew back to the shelf and sorted themselves into their original places."Not the right wand, I suppose," Mr. Ollivander put the wand back to the box and went back to the shelves.Soon he came out of the passage between two shelves on the right hand side. He had four boxes in his hand.Kent tried them one by one but found no suitable match."Quite the tricky customer. Let's try a tricky wand then," muttered Mr. Ollivander as he went to room at the back of shop.While Mr. Ollivander was busy picking the right wand, Kent was reminiscing about the sensation he felt when he was trying out the previous wands.It took a bit of time for Mr. Ollivander to come out. This time he had only one box in his hand."This one's a unique wand with an unusual combination. I had tried making a second one only to end in a failure," Mr. Ollivander explained the story behind the wand."Why so, Mr. Ollivander?" asked Kent looking curiously at the yellowish wand."Cedar wood known for choosing owner with strong characters and loyalty never tend to mix with feathers from phoenix known for its detached and aloof temperament. It was by an experimental accident that I was able to make the wand," explained Mr. Ollivander and handed the nine and half inch long wand to Kent.The moment he touched the wand, Kent knew he had found the right wand. It was like the last piece of puzzle settled into the right position and he became whole. The feeling was very magical.From the side, they saw Kent glowing faintly with red which subsided on the next second."Very good, I expected great things from both of you," said Mr. Ollivander.Paying the 14 galleons for the Wands, the family came out of the shop.After escorting the Granger family out of the Leaky Cauldron, professor McGonagall disappeared.The Granger family took a bus and returned home. On the way back, Kent and Hermione remained vigilant.Kent's danger sense was triggered quite a few times while shopping in Diagon Alley.They were not sure if the hostile party or parties would follow them back. So just to be safe, they were ready to fight in a moment's notice.AN: Where's my review?

"Take care of your sister, Son," said Mr. Granger giving a pat on Kent's shoulder.They were standing on a platform packed with people, next to a scarlet steam engine.The atmosphere was lively with some students saying goodbye to their family, some fighting for the seat near the window."I will, dad," said Kent firmly.Their conversation was cut off by the whistle of the steam engine.Hermione who was standing in front of the door of an empty compartment with both of their trunks, looked back and urged Kent to come quickly."Goodbye, Dad" said Kent as he ran off to join Hermione.Taking a last glance at their dad, they lifted their luggage onto the train through the small door, albeit a little difficulty.Tucking their trunks separately in a corner of the compartment, they sat down next to the window opposite to each other.With a whistle the train began to move. They waved at their dad who soon disappeared from view as the train picked up the speed.Kent leaned against the seat comfortably while fiddling with the wand. The wand was moving smoothly between his fingers as if there was an extra limb which was manipulating it.After getting his own wand, it had become a habit of playing with it whenever he felt bored."Just stop playing with it, will you," said Hermione angrily closing the thick book in her hand."Sorry," Kent stopped playing with the wand but didn't put it away."So, what do you think we should do? About Neville, I mean do you wanna help him find his toad? What was it's name again?" asked Kent."Trevor." reminded Hermione. The little toad had a significant role in her life. Through it, she met two of her best friend on the train in her "first try at life" as she likes to call it."Ah yes, Trevor. So what do you want to do?" asked Kent. He never liked to impose his plan on others, if not absolutely necessary.And Hermione was an adult, she could decide for herself. He could suggest but that's all."I don't know. I don't want to change everything, you know. I miss them. I miss my friends. I wish our friendship could be back to the way it was in the future." answered Hermione with melancholy."I dare not say that I can understand what you're feeling. I never had gone through a war much less had friends on whom I could depend with my life. But if you really want my advice then I would suggest, take it slow. Observe and interact with them, see where it leads," suggested Kent."I know. I really want to. It's just I'm afraid, I'm afraid to face them knowing that they are not and can never be the same person I once knew," said Hermione expressing her fear.The compartment fell into a strange silence.Knock!The silence was broken by a knock on the door. They saw a round-faced boy standing outside."Speak of the devil," muttered Kent."Come in," said Kent politely."I'm sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad?""No, I'm afraid not," answered Kent. Hearing Kent's words the boy looked as if he was going to cry."How about I help you search for your toad?" Offered Kent. The boy wanted to say something but Kent didn't give him any chance to speak.Standing up and straightening his robe, he said to the boy, "let's go,"He looked back and nodded at Hermione who was trying her best to control her emotions.He wasn't worried about Hermione's safety. He might be stronger and faster than her physically but in terms of magical powers, he was far from being her opponent. She didn't need his protection."I am Kent Granger," introduced Kent while walking through the narrow corridor."I...I am Neville, Neville Longbottom," the round-faced boy stammered shaking Kent's hand nervously."Don't worry we will soon find your toad," Kent reassured Neville with a pat on the shoulder.Kent had another purpose other than helping Neville. It was to explore the compartments and meet new students, see if they look anything similar to what he remembers from the movie.The coach they were in, was pretty long. To search more efficiently, Neville and Kent chose to go in opposite direction of the coach.Kent went toward the back end of the coach. According to what he could recall from the movie, Harry Potter should be in one of the compartments near the end of the train.One by one, he knocked on each compartment and asked the occupants if they had seen Neville's toad. Unfortunately most of them answered "no", some said that they had seen a toad but forgot where they had seen it.After getting "no" as an answer from majority of the students, he wondered, "Did Trevor jump off the train?""Anything off the trolley, dears?"He was snapped out of his thoughts by a female voice.He saw a lady in deep red dress, probably in her forties, standing with a trolley full of candies.He walked forward and saw a black haired boy buying off most of candies from the lady."Is that Harry Potter?" muttered Kent. He couldn't get a proper look at the boy as his back was turned against Kent.After the lady passed by him with her "almost empty" trolley, Kent walked up to the compartment door.The door was already open. Two boys were busy sorting through the candies sprawled all over the seat.He knocked on the frame of the door to get their attention."Have you seen a toad?" Kent asked, "My friend Neville lost it."Kent took a quick glance at the rat sleeping on the lap of the red haired teen before turning his attention toward the bespectacled boy with black hair."No," answered the red haired boy irritably."Thank you," Kent said, "Sorry, by the way."Kent then walked away from the compartment. He had already confirmed what he intended to. Also It would be rude to interrupt their meal.On the way to his compartment he met up with Neville who looked tearful."You should properly check your own compartment. The toad might be in there somewhere," suggested Kent helplessly. It was really difficult to search for a tiny toad in such a vast coach."T-thank you. I will," said Neville in a low voice.When he came back, he saw a bespectacled girl with short brown hair coming out of the compartment Hermione was in.Returning back to his seat, he asked, "Who was she?""Her name is Sally-Anne Perks. She's a first year like us." answered Hermione. Her mood had improved a bit."Sally-Anne, the name doesn't ring any bell." Kent shook his head."She dropped out of Hogwarts after taking her OWLs exam in the future." informed Hermione."Oh,""So, what did you find?" asked Hermione changing the topic."Everything is pretty similar to what we know," answered Kent."Did you see that rat?" asked Hermione with a menacing expression."Yes." Kent said."Was it missing a toe?" Hermione asked again."Probably." Kent wasn't very sure.Getting a stare from Hermione, he justified, "I couldn't get a proper look. They were having a meal!""You know, we can just grab Sirius from Azkaban. It'd save us a lot of time and work," said Kent as if he had a sudden enlightenment."First of all, we don't know the layout of the jail. And also it's impossible to bypass the dementors without alerting the guards," she said seriously, "and most important fact is that we are not powerful enough to just waltz our way into the jail and grab Sirius. Also–""Stop stop. I know it's difficult but I am worried whether your plan would work." Kent said, "I mean, some of the 'upright' and politically influential people will not want to see Sirius Black getting a trial. Especially Lucius Malfoy, he always coveted the heritage of Black family.""Malfoy's still not influential enough to manipulate the minister and most importantly Fudge recently became a minister," Hermione argued back."It's also risky to use Rita Skeeter," Kent reminded, "Daily Prophet's probably under those pureblood bigots.""You don't have to worry, I will meet her under disguise." She said,"and also don't forget that she's an unregistered animagus.""By the way, what's your animagus?" Kent asked suddenly."I was getting started in my sixth year but then Dumbledore died and the war escalated. Harry and I were too busy running away from the death eaters to relax and practice. One thing led to another." She said, "I never got the chance,"The compartment fell into an awkward silence again.Kent was embarrassed. He was mentally a decade older than Hermione. He was supposed to be comforting her but didn't know how to."You don't have to feel bad though," Hermione said with a smile, "I am happy that I got a chance to redo everything.""Yes." Kent said, "I am also happy that I got the chance to learn and practice magic.""But first we need get rid of that dark w*nker," added Kent jokingly to lighten up the mood."Language Kent!" Scolded Hermione trying her best to keep a straight face.

It was already dark when the train reached Hogsmeade station.Kent and Hermione got off the train train in the midst of the students pushing their way through the door."Firs' years! Firs' years over here!" They saw a huge man about as tall as the train coming over with a lamp in his hand.'Hagrid's really huge!' Kent looked up at the man with the lamp and wandered, 'Then, what about real giants?'The first year students gathered in front of the Hagrid one by one."All right there, Harry?" asked Hagrid.Harry sleepily nodded. It was a long journey."Any more firs' years? C'mon then, follow me!"The first years followed Hagrid down a steep narrow path. It was really difficult to see on the either side of the path because of the dark."Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here.""Wow!" Kent looked at the vast castle perched over a high mountain on the other side of the lake.Hermione was silent by his side. She had a complicated feeling looking at the familiar castle. It had brought her so much joy but also had ruined her life once."We won't let it happen again," Kent said softly.Hermione nodded, clenching her fist."No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of small boats sitting in the water by the shore. Each boat had a lamp hanging from the wooden post stuck on it.Kent and Hermione got into a boat followed by the girl Sally-Anne Perks and another lively girl with blond hair."Everyone in?" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. "Right then -- FORWARD!"And the fleet of small boats moved off all at once, slowly gliding across the lake.The castle was getting bigger and bigger as they moved closer to the other side.Kent got a clear view on how big and majestic the castle was."Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of vines that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.Kent and Hermione were the only ones who didn't have any difficulties walking on the rocks.They steadily walked through the crowd of students and stopped beside Hagrid who had a little toad in his huge hand.'When did Hagrid got it?' Kent wondered."Trevor!" cried Neville blissfully holding out his hands.Then the students, except for Kent and Hermione who were walking steadily as walking on a flat land, clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door."Everyone here?"Hagrid raised his gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.While everyone was nervous, Kent was quietly looking at door, recording everything in his sight using the system library. There were lots of unknown intricate symbols and inscription on the door. They might come in handy one day.A few moments later, the door swung opened to reveal a familiar face.Kent recognised the black haired witch at first glance. She was Professor McGonagall who "introduced" him and his sister to the magical world and also acted as a guide in Diagon Alley."Firs' years, professor McGonagall," said Hagrid."Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here."She pulled the door wide. The entrance was big, big enough to fit a medium sized house in it. The grey walls were lit with flaming torches. In the front was a marble staircase that led to upper floors.The Granger duo followed behind the professor along with other first years.'The door probably leads to the great hall,' guessed Kent hearing the drone of voices coming from the doorway to the right.The professor led them to a an empty hall and stopped in front of them.The students crowded in, standing rather close to each other. Kent and Hermione stood at the side."Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room."The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours."The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting."Her eyes roamed around the students for a moment."I shall return when we are ready for you," said Professor McGonagall. "Please wait quietly."The hall fell silent. There were bouts of whisper but no one spoke out loud."Are you nervous?" Kent whispered to Hermione."Yes, I am afraid we have to lower our occlumency shield for the hat to sort us." Hermione said, "it uses legilimency.""I don't think the hat remembers what it sees," Kent said. "It must have sorted so many students in the last thousand years. It can't possibly retain everyone's memory, right?""What the – ?!"Their conversation was cut short by a collective gasp from the crowd. The students were staring at a group of pear-white and slightly transparent figures floating and talking with each other.It was their first time seeing ghosts. It was bound to scare them a little.Kent looked at the ghosts curiously wandering if they were real spirits."Move along now," said a sharp voice. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to start."Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall."Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and follow me."Kent and Hermione were the last to join the line, with Kent standing behind Hermione.They followed the professor out of the chamber back across entrance hall, and through a pair of double doors into the great hall.The great hall was lit by the numerous candles that were floating over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students.Kent looked at teachers. He recognised headmaster Dumbledore, who was sitting at the middle of the high table.He also recognised professor Quirrell by his large purple turban, who was fidgeting constantly. He was having a conversation with a greasy haired man sitting beside him."That must be professor Snape." Kent guessed but turned his eyes sideways. From the the corner of his eyes he could see professor Snape looked at him.'Phew! He's too sensitive,' thought Kent as his eyes fell on professor McGonagall.She placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top the stool, she placed a pointed wizards hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty.Kent shivered at the thought putting that dirty hat onto his head.Soon the chattering of the students quieted down with all of them staring at the hat, waiting for something to happen. The hat twitched as if it was coming to life. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,But don't judge on what you see,I'll eat myself if you can findA smarter hat than me.You can keep your bowlers black,Your top hats sleek and tall,For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting HatAnd I can cap them all.There's nothing hidden in your headThe Sorting Hat can't see,So try me on and I will tell youWhere you ought to be.You might belong in Gryffindor,Where dwell the brave at heart,Their daring, nerve, and chivalrySet Gryffindors apart;You might belong in Hufflepuff,Where they are just and loyal,Those patient Hufflepuffs are trueAnd unafraid of toil;Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind,Where those of wit and learning,Will always find their kind;Or perhaps in SlytherinYou'll make your real friends,Those cunning folk use any meansTo achieve their ends.So put me on! Don't be afraid!And don't get in a flap!You're in safe hands (though I have none)For I'm a Thinking Cap!"The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment."When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails slowly walked to the stool, put on the hat and sat down."HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat.The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at Hufflepuff table."Bones, Susan!""HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again, and Susan scurried off to sit next to Hannah."Boot, Terry!""RAVENCLAW!"The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them."Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers."Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin."Finch-Fletchley, Justin!""HUFFLEPUFF!""Finnigan, Seamus," a sandy-haired boy sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor"Granger, Hermione!"Despite having gone through the sorting ceremony once, Hermione was a little nervous. Fighting was lot more easier than being on a stage with hundreds of eyes on you.She put on the hat and sat quietly on the stool. It took about half a minute to decide which house she belonged to."GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat. The Gryffindor table once again burst into loud cheers.Hermione slowly walked to the familiar long table and sat on an empty sit."Granger, Kent!"The crowd saw a boy, little over five feet tall, walked out of the line. The extra attention was due to the fact that his surname was same as Hermione's, who was just sorted.Kent was nervous. Neither in his past life nor in this life had he ever stood in front of a crowd with all their attention on him. It was a little nerve-wracking.He quietly walked to the stool and picked up the hat. He took a glance inside. It looked clean.He sat on the stool and put on the hat. The hat fell over his eyes hindering half of his vision.'Godric Gryffindor sure had a huge head,' a funny picture appeared in his mind.'Let's see what we have here,' a rough voice sounded in his head. He waited for the hat's "evaluation" of him, see if it matches with his own ''evaluation".'A curious yet cautious mind,' The hat said in his head, 'Brave heart but with a sense of restraint. A seeker of knowledge. Where to put you–''Just put me in Gryffindor,' said Kent.'Gryffindor eh?' chuckled the hat, 'So be it–"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat.The table to the far left burst into cheers.Putting the hat back on the stool, Kent walked to the Gryffindor table and sat down next to his sister. He took a quick glance at the long table to the far right.It was then Neville's turn. The round-faced boy fell over on his way to the stool. It took about a minute to decide as the hat finally shouted "GRYFFINDOR!".Then a thin boy by the name "MacDougal, Morag" was sorted into Slytherine.It was finally Malfoy's turn. He was blonde guy with a "I am better than everyone" fac. He walked confidently to the stool. The hat barely touched his head before it shouted "SLYTHERINE".The three student after him with surname, "Moon", "Nott", "Parkinson" were also sorted into Slytherine one by one.Then a pair of twin girls by the name "Parvati Patil" and "Padma Patil" were sorted. The first one to Gryffindor and the second one to Ravenclaw.Then Kent saw the familiar bespectacled "Perks, Sally-Anne" walking to the stool nervously. It took only few seconds for the hat to sort her into Ravenclaw."Potter, Harry!" When Harry's name was called the hall fell into a strange silence. There were occasional whispers among the students as the black-haired boy slowly walked to the stool.After Harry put on the hat, Kent noticed that he was whispering something.A minute later, the hat shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!"The Gryffindor table burst into loud cheer and applause. It was different from before as most of the students in the Gryffindor table stood up and clapped. A pair of twins with red hair even shouted "We got Potter! We got Potter!".And now there were only four people left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean," a black boy taller than most first years, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. "Turpin, Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and "Weasley, Ronald", the red haired boy who was with Harry Potter was sorted into Gryffindor.The ceremony ended with the last student by the name "Zabini, Blaise" being sorted into Slytherin.Headmaster Dumbledore rose from his seat. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there."Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!""Thank you!"He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered.'Eccentricity stems from power and authority.' Kent figured. Dumbledore was probably the only wizard who held three to four positions at the same time and also one of the most powerful wizards of all time.Soon he was snapped out of the thoughts as food magically appeared on the gold laden plates. There were so many varieties of food: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.'Elves' magic is really advanced,' thought Kent as he began eating. He really envied the ability of the elves to remain invisible and teleport which seems to have no barrier, at least he never heard any.Then his attention turned to ghost that just came out through the table."That does look good," said the ghost in the ruff sadly."Can't you -- ?" Harry Potter, the bespectacled boy offered the piece of steak he was going to eat."I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years," said the ghost. "I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.""I know who you are!" said Ron suddenly. "My brothers told me about you -- you're Nearly Headless Nick!""I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy -- " the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted."Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?"Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted."Like this," he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, "So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost."Kent and other first-years nearby, looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy."How did he get covered in blood?" asked Seamus with great interest."I've never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding...As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families."I'm half-and-half," said Seamus. "Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him."The others laughed."What about you, Neville?" said Ron."Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch," said Neville, "but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad."'No wonder Neville's so clumsy,' Kent thought.At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent."Ahem -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you."First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well."Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins."I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors."Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch."And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.""And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried Dumbledore.After singing the 'out-of-tune' song, the Gryffindor's first-years followed Percy the prefect through a series of moving stairs to finally reach the portrait of a fat lady in pink silk dress."Password?" asked the lady in the portrait."Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a round room full of squashy armchairs.Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another.

After setting up a simple warning ward around his bed which he had learned from Hermione, Kent finally relaxed.Despite having his danger sense, Kent set up the ward as an extra precaution.He was quite certain that Scabbers, being a coward that he was, won't attack anyone in the dormitory but it was quite unsettling to sleep in the same dorm as a murderer.Scabbers was the rat that Ron Weasley currently owned. It was not actually a rat but Peter Pettigrew in his animagus form.Unlike majority of the Wizarding world, Kent knew that it was Pettigrew who blew up the street and killed twelve muggles framing Sirius Black.With the assurance of his acute sense of danger that works even if he is asleep and the warning ward he set up, he closed the curtain to his bed.Under the dim simmering light of the lamp, the tiredness of today's journey took over as he fell asleep.The next morning, he woke up early around 6 o'clock. After brushing his teeth and taking a quick shower he changed to a pair of warm clothes and went to the common room. It was empty.He went back to the dorm and took out a book titled "Magical Theory" written by Adalbert Waffling.Back in the common room, he dragged an arm-chair closer to the fireplace and sat on it.With nothing else to do, he quietly read the book.No matter how many times he read the book, it never seized to amaze him.The book had several theories about how magic came to be or what magic actually is. It gave him a lot of inspirations on how to improve the spells he had learned. Especially the wand movements, which he found were nothing but runes."What are you reading?" asked a female voice from behind him."A book on magical theory," Kent answered. He was already aware of Hermione's presence."Have you had breakfast?" asked Hermione."Aren't students supposed to eat together?" asked Kent."It's not mandatory but a tradition," Hermione said, "let's go, I am hungry.""Wait for a sec," he said as he went back to the dormitory to put the book in his trunk.After having a fulfilling breakfast, Kent followed Hermione to the library.It was a huge library, probably the largest he had ever seen. Seeing so many books, Kent wondered if he would be able to record all of it.'Let's start with spells and transfiguration,' he decided.Spells are the most important part of an wizards strength, be it auxiliary spells like levitation spell and summoning charm or offensive spells like the cutting curse and blasting hex.As for transfiguration, it is the most versatile branch of magic. You can use it to attack, defend and also for auxiliary purposes.Hermione being familiar with every corner of the library showed him the relevant sections.Kent first went to the section with books mostly on transfiguration, theory and laws related to it.There were three shelves with about hundreds of books in each. He was unfamiliar with most of them, so he chose the books randomly.He was just going to record the information contained in them.He carried the book to the table next to the shelves. There were very few students at this time in the library. Kent guessed that it must be because classes hadn't started yet, there were no homework whatsoever. Only the ones who loved reading and acquiring knowledge would come to the library so early.Leaning against the wooden chair, he activated the record function of the system library.He opened a thick book with leathered cover and started flipping through the pages.He would pause and glance at each page for a moment and then glance at the next one.In the beginning he had underestimated the capability of the system, especially the library function. A glance is what it requires to record a piece of information like page of a book or a picture.The process of pausing and glancing at each page went on for about a minute before he finished the hundred and fifty page book. Putting it aside, he opened the next one and went through the same process.One by one the pile containing ten books were finished within an hour. He put back all the book to their original position and chose the next batch of books.He kept repeating the same process for the next two hours. After that he had to slow down because the library started filling in with students mostly seniors in the sixth or seventh years.It was almost noon when he finished the first shelf. Looking at remaining two shelves, he determined that it would take another day to record all the books related to transfiguration that are not in restricted section.He really wanted to record the more advanced knowledge from the books in restricted sections but unfortunately a slip from one of the teachers was needed.'Don't be so impatient, Kent!' he reminded himself. There wasn't much to worry because it only needed good performance and a plausible excuse to get the teacher's permission.After lunch, he returned back to the library.If possible, he wanted to record all books on transfiguration today.This time, instead of going back and forth between the table and the shelves, he pulled out a book while standing, took a glance at each page and then return it to its original position. It was way faster and convenient.The next day, Kent woke up early like usual, took a shower and changed to his Hogwarts uniform.Gryffindor first years was scheduled to have their first transfiguration class with the Slytherins at 9 o'clock in the morning.Just like yesterday he and his sister didn't do the daily exercise like they used to do in their home. It was because they hadn't found a good place outside of prying eyes.It was unfortunate that the simulation space of the system had little effect on the physical body.Having their breakfast and resting for a bit in the common room, Kent and Hermione went directly to the classroom where professor McGonagall would be taking the transfiguration class.Although they reached ten minutes earlier than the designated time for the start of the class, there were already lot of first years in the room.The classroom was huge. There was a big blackboard behind the teacher's desk in the front. A cat, ignored by most of the students, was quietly resting on the desk.The student's desks were arranged in rows with certain spaces between them. It was probably to reduce the possibility of students accidentally hitting each other with spells.The Granger siblings sat down in an empty desk at the back of the first row from the right.The students of Gryffindor and Slytherine House were sitting in separate rows as if they had an unspoken rule.Five minutes had passed since the start of the class time but there was no sign of professor McGonagall. Kent knew that the odd looking cat sitting on the desk was in fact the professor's animagus form. Kent could guess that she was waiting for Harry Potter.Kent was curiously watching the behaviour of the cat.The cat's ears perked up as she stood up abruptly. Moments later, Kent heard a pair hurried footsteps from outside the classroom.A pair of boys came running in. They were panting as if they had run a marathon.Their entrance attracted the attention of every student in the room. It was mostly because of the bespectacled boy with black hair. He was the boy-who-lived after all.Seeing that professor McGonagall wasn't present, both of the boys sighed with relief."Looks like we came in time," the red haired boy laughed but it was cut short by a sharp voice."No Mr. Weasley, you and Mr. Potter are five minutes late," the cat that standing atop the front desk jumped and changed into professor McGonagall and said, "I hope that I won't have any students coming into my class late from the next day."For the first half of the class, professor McGonagall introduced the students to the art of transfiguration, theory behind it and the mistakes to avoid.The students scribbled down everything.Even though Kent had finished the first year course with the help of the system, he noted down everything. There were lot of unique insights from the professor in it; they couldn't be found in the book."Today you will be learning how to turn a match into needle," the professor said, "but before we start, I must warn you that transfiguration is one of most dangerous magic. I will not have anyone messing around in my class."After getting a stern warning from the professor, each student was given a match.Most of the students started trying according to the instructions given by professor McGonagall, only to realise that it was not as easy as shown by the professor.At the back, Kent"Well done, Mr. Granger," professor McGonagall said with a smile, "five points to Gryffindor for your excellent performance.""Thank you, professor." replied Kent politely. He was not being humble. He himself knew that he was not a genius.Having an adult mind not only provided Kent with many benefits but also with a great obstacle.The obstacle being the rigidity of his thinking making it harder to believe in anything that is not normal, thus affecting his magic, be it transfiguration or spells.He spent countless hours practicing spells and transfiguration in the simulation space of the system, to overcome this psychological barrier.The successful transfiguration done by Kent triggered other students in the room to be more enthusiastic about turning the match into needle, especially the Slytherine students. It was quite embarrassing and unacceptable for them to be overtaken by muggleborn students in terms of magic.But their enthusiasm was short lived as they couldn't produce any change whatsoever in the colour or structure of the match.At end of the lesson, it was only Kent who successfully turned the match into needle. As for Hermione, she only changed the colour of match to silver which was was purely intentional.

The OfferingEnglandDiagon AlleyWeasley's Wizard WheezesAre you sure? I need to replenish our reserves of Peruvian Darkness Powder, and I already have the trip to Peru all planned.""George, I am just as surprised as you are. But it does check out. The best ingredients are not actually harvested in Peru.""Well… then where?""Mexico.""Are you trying to cheer me up with a prank, Harry?""No. You know I'm not the best at pranking. Not even passable."George Weasley sighed. "I know, br… little brother."A heavy silence fell between the two. It was Harry who broke it. "I miss him too."George swallowed the lump in his throat, and passed an arm over Harry's shoulder. A comforting gesture gesture for both. "I know. I know. Everyday I expect to see him."Harry nodded. George continued. "You know why I let my beard grow?"His friend shook his head."I cannot stand to see myself in the mirror." He closed his eyes. "Angelina thinks it's because of my ear." He smiled sadly, caressing the mangled flesh. "It's because every time I shave, I see Fred looking back at me. And it breaks my heart every single time. The first week I broke all the mirrors we had at our…" a tear fell down his face, he wiped it distractedly. "At our flat." He finished."I just…" he waved a hand, trying to explain. "I don't know… I just stared at my reflection, waiting for Fred to talk to me, he usually was the first one to say something. I was there, standing with the razor in my hand, my face full of foam. Just staring, Harry. Just staring at my brother. Waiting for him to talk." His voice broke in a ragged sob. "I don't know how to explain it, that emptiness in my chest.""George." Harry whispered softly, when his friend raised his head after a long time. "I know how it feels.""Do you?" There was no anger in the question. "How can you know it, little brother?""It was back in my First Year. Do you remember the three headed dog?"George nodded. "Oh, yes." He smiled a little, remembering, " it scared us out of our skins, that ruddy dog.""Us too. Ron, Hermione and me.""Well… close to where Fluffy was guarding the entrance to a lower room, Dumbledore had another thing stored. A bloody mirror."George imitated Hermione's voice. "Honestly, Harry. Language."Harry chuckled, George had it down. From the voice, to the tone, even his facial expression were all Hermione's. He continued, shaking George's shoulders. "It was a standing mirror, a magical one.""Mirror, mirror, on the wall…" George intoned, "who is the Harryest of them all?""Be serious, George!" A moment later, Harry's face fell, remembering his late Godfather, who loved that awful pun."Sorry, it was not my intention. Please, go on.""It's okay. Well… it had a strange inscription on top. I can't even say it from memory, but the thing was called The Mirror of Erised. It doesn't show your reflection, but what you really, in the bottom of your heart, what you really want."George gasped. "I…" he hesitated."It showed me my family." Harry looked up. "Dad, Mum, holding me close. I had never in my life up to then… I had never felt loved, George. Never." The lone twin didn't know what to do. He knew Harry had been gravely mistreated by those animals. Denied everything but scraps. And even those, given with hate and disdain. It was a wonder he had turned out as a good guy."I spent several nights there, just looking at that illusion. Even then, I knew it was not real. But I had to be there to feel them. And you know what? Later that year, when Hagrid gave me the album of pictures he had collected for me, the people from the mirror didn't really match with the pictures. But these, even in pictures, these were my parents.""I didn't know that, Harry.""It's okay, George. It was a long time ago. Maybe someday I will tell you more. When we are both ready. Right now," he stood up brusquely, slapping his thighs, "we have to plan your trip."Late OctoberMexico CityHernandez Household"Welcome to my humble home, Mister Weesli." The Mexican wizard slapped George's back, almost knocking him down. "Sandra! Cariño!" He bellowed, "tenemos visita!"A dark skinned woman came down the stair. She smiled widely, wiping her hands in a hanky she put into the pocket of her apron. "Well…come…" she said, frowning. She shook her head and said to her husband, "Apenas me medio acuerdo de mis clases de Inglés, Sergio! Dile que es bienvenido a la casa y que su cuarto estará listo en un ratito."Sergio Hernández kissed her in the cheek, pinching her bottom at the same time. She slapped his hand playfully. "Que va a pensar el señor?!"Sergio laughed, and winked at her, "Que mi esposa es la más linda de la ciudad!" He turned back to George. "My wife doesn't really speak English, but she says your room will be ready in a few minutes.""Ah, um," George opened the common phrases book Harry had given him, smiled awkwardly at both, and said "Grass-ee-as, sen-eeora Err-nan-dess." He raised his eyebrows questioningly, hoping he had not mangled the words too badly.Sergio nodded in approval. "Good enoff, Mister Weesli!" He nodded, tilting his head to the left. "You'll need a bit of practice, but that's okay, no one is born knowing. Now, you must be tired and hungry." He checked his watch, "We eat in half an hour, you're welcome to join us, but," he raised his right index, "I suggest you don't add the salsa to your food. My wife is famous for her home made guacamole, and she likes it really, really spicy!"George nodded, "I've heard the stories. It can't be that hot, I mean."Sergio laughed again, George would have compared it to Hagrid's booming laughter, but his host actually sounded even louder than the half-giant! "Don't say I didn't warn you. Well, I'll just ask Sandra to reserve a bit of guacamole with less chili."Half an hour later, George Weasley realized that Mexican food could be both delicious and a torture at the same time.He put a bit of the curious green stuff on the meat on his platter, "Seg-ooro keh no peeca?" He said, remembering the phrase book phonetic instructions."Quite sure, this may be just a little hot, but just a little. Kid stuff, really." A child of about six years, with a wild mop of hair that reminded George of Harry's own, though short and quite spiky, signaled George for permission to take a small spoonful, George nodded, unsure of what to say.The boy, Manuel, George remembered the name, proceeded to take a tortilla, putting some pieces of chicharrón on it, spread the guacamole over the crispy pieces, rolled the tortilla, and bit into it with evident pleasure."See? Kid stuff!" Sergio boomed.However, Sandra filled George's glass with fresh watermelon juice, diluted in water and with just a little bit of sugar added. "Por si las moscas." She said."What did she say?""Actually… it doesn't translate well, but it means 'Just in case.'"George did follow Sergio's instruction, under Manuel's expectant gaze. George recognized the gleam in the boys eyes. He and Fred had it just before springing a prank!'I'm about to make a mistake. I know…' he thought. He cut the meat, and without hesitation, he chewed. The taste was amazing! He closed his eyes for a moment, concentrating on the favour and texture.He nodded as he swallowed, "Mui sav-rosso!" He said, and it was then when it hit him. His tongue began to get warn, then hot, and finally, he felt as if his whole mouth was on fire! He fanned his hands desperately, looking around. Sergio put the glass in his hands, and George drank it in three frantic gulps!Sandra had already poured another, and gave it to him.George managed to empty the whole jar of watermelon water. He gasped and wiped his face with a hanky, still fanning his mouth."Esta bien, Señor Weesli?" Sandra asked. George nodded spasmodically. "Yeah, I think… That has quite a punch!"With all seriousness, Sergio pontified, "Mister Weesli, if a Mexican says a salsa isn't hot, it is hot. If he says it's mildly hot, it is very hot. If he says it is very hot, it is extremely hot. And if he says it is really, really hot, you better have your will registered and your affairs in order." Then he broke laughing. "I mean it!""And this was?" George gestured at the little dish."Not hot."Sandra took the dish, replacing it with another. "Es solo aguacate con sal. Sin chile."Sergio translated, while Manuel snickered "Avocado with a pinch of salt. No chili. I trust you'll find it to your liking." He smiled again.With some fear, George tried it. But just as promised, it was not spicy at all.That night, Sandra and her grandmother, decorated a small table near the dining room. There were some pictures, and, to George's surprise, small skulls made of sugar or chocolate among the bright orange flowers.Sergio pulled two chairs to the backyard, and sat with George. He had brought a couple of beers from the kitchen and gave one to George."Curious?""Yeah. In England we celebrate both Halloween and Samhain, we plácate the angry ghosts, at least, symbolically. I had never seen sugar skulls." He scratched his head, puzzled."We are a complicated mix of traditions, Mister Weesli. Some from our native ancestor, some from our Spaniard ancestors. But the short version Is this. We remember our departed in this form. Tradition says that the night of October the 31st, the veil between the land of the living," he sweeped his hand around, "and the land of the dead, gets open, and the ghost of our late relatives has permission to come up for a visit. We, the living, put an altar for them, an offering, with their pictures, so they know we still remember them. That night, we prepare their favorite food, and put it in the altar, so their spirits can eat once again.""And they do eat it?" George leaned forward on his chair."Symbolically, yes. They eat the… the essence of the food, because they are spirits. We do get to eat the rest, of course." His smile was full of memories. "Come, I'll introduce you. And explain the meaning of each part of the altar."October the 31stBack in EnglandGeorge Weasley's FlatEarly EveningGeorge arranged the table just as Sergio and Sandra had shown him. On the table, a jar of water, a little bowl full of salt, several lit candles, incense, cempasúchil flowers (those had been a bit of a problem at customs, until the inspector determined the plants were not magical), a petate(kind of rug/tablecloth/bed, made of woven fibers), a small ceramic dog, a round bread Sergio had called "Pan de Muerto" (Bread of the Dead), a picture of Fred, a plate with Fred's favorite dinner dish, a sandwich with bacon, butter, tomato and cheese. George had barely managed to prepare it, the memories kept coming. And finally, two chocolate skulls. Both twins preferred chocolate to candy. On the forehead of one, Fred's name, lovingly written on a small piece of paper; on the other, George's name. Of course, under each paper, there was another, with the other's name. Fred would have approved.George checked his altar once again."There's water, Fred, for you to drink. Salt, to keep your spirit pure. Candles, to light your way. Incense, to keep evil spirits away. You know who you are, guys, you are not welcome. The flowers," George scratched his head, "I'm not really sure about those, but that's how I was shown, so here they are, I hope they will guide you here, brother. The petate… I had never even heard of it, but well, today is a mantlecloth. The izcuintli, the toy dog, to keep you company in the way here and back. The bread, well… it is very tasty, I'm sure you'll like it. And a sandwich, just the way you liked it. Be welcome to this humble dinner, Fred. I miss you."George set everything as Sergio and Sandra had shown him. He lit the candles, making sure there was nothing flammable around, and setting a few fire-proofing charms, just in case. "Ah, I almost forgot." He poured two measures of firewhiskey in two glasses. He took one, and clinked it against the other, "For you, Fred, the best brother I could have asked for. Cheers!"And he drank it in one gulp. Two puffs of smoke came out of his ears. He sat on a comfy chair, watching his offering.And remembered his late brother, until he fell asleep with a smile on his lips.For the first time in a very long time, he felt at peace. The emptiness in his chest would be still there in the morning; but for now, just for this night, Fred and George Weasley were together again.

AUDREY BLANCHARD ALWAYS HAD BEEN a mix of bubblegum, pop music and a bit too much prettiness.The first time that she made a boy blush she had been five and little Edward White had asked for one of her crayons – and she had given him a smile, bright enough to make the boy fall from his chair. Since then, little Audrey Blanchard had been a hurricane around boys (and some girls), full of big smiles and sassy winks that, most often than not, landed her in trouble.Because Audrey Blanchard was born different.Of course, this could be mean she was born a witch – like her beloved father – with magic flowing in her veins and witchcraft deep in her bones, potions and spells etched in her very soul. But, in her world, that was normal, and thousands of children around of the world were born with all those things every year.But Audrey being Audrey, of course things wouldn't be as simple as being born a witch in a long line of other witches. Her father, of course, the extra drama queen he was, really had to make things worse for baby Audrey and make her mother a veela.Beautiful creatures, the veelas, with the appearance of a dashing blonde woman whose looks could make any man feel at their feet. Except by the fact they aren't humans, and Audrey always had those disturbing thoughts in the back of her mind of how in hell her father would thought a good idea to have sex with a non-human creature who, when angry, turned in a bad bad bird who breathed fire.But the point is, something in the middle of the last decade – you know, crazy 1970s – her father – famous, rich heir who liked outrageous clothes and cheesy pick-up lines, but had been a very handsome young man in his twenties – had found himself a lost veela in the middle of Beverly Hills and got the damn thing pregnant, and that was how Audrey was born.Her grandparents had been scandalised. Baby Audrey, in her mother womb (do Veelas have wombs?) probably had been too. Things went downfall very quickly this point onwards – her mother had left her with daddy Mr. Blanchard and disappeared, because apparently veelas aren't keen in keeping in touch with human flings – and baby Audrey had been raised by a less than prepared father.Ezra Blanchard wasn't a bad father if we must be fair. He was kind, and considered, and always liked to spend time with his daughter, but he just wasn't cut to raise someone, since he couldn't even be responsible by himself. Maybe he would be a nice uncle – you know, the one who teach you how to drive and which beers are good and the ones who aren't, but not a dad.Then you see the problem.The moment Audrey was born, even if she had been an adorable baby – all pink cheeks and big, blue eyes – she was a responsibility and Ezra Blanchard wasn't good with those. Then, by the time Audrey was old enough, he had shipped her to the other side of the world, to a boarding school in England, under the pretext of Hogwarts – what kind of name was that? – was where he studied.Audrey didn't care for any of this bullshit. She was more worried by the fact that her father had shipped her alone to another country – England, dear Lord, are she going to have tea? She hated tea – to a school full of normal people – you know, under the wizard normal status – where she was no meant to talk about her heritage.God forbid someone to discover the things that her father liked to do in his Manor, in Beverly Hills, far away from the judgement of his parents.Like you know, fuck a non-human being, and have a daughter with said non-human being.And this is how Audrey Blanchard – heiress to crazy bachelor Ezra Blanchard, sixth biggest fortune in magic Europe – got herself giving dirty looks to Hogwarts Express every single year.

PART ONE: FADINGwhere she has to found herself{1991 - 1993}I"I have to do what?""You have to run straight at the wall, darling", her grandmother said with the same ice-cold voice she used to everything that annoyed her in the slightest. In the few days Audrey had spent in London, safely tucked in her grandparents mansion – the old and fancy Blanchard House – had been enough to grasp a lot of things about Mrs. Evelyn Blanchard, the matriarch of her family; first, she was a tall, elder witch with grey hair always in a tight bun, and second, she had no patience with children at all.And normally adults loved Audrey. She was educated, pretty and knew when to shut up. What more an adult could ask from an eleven-year-old?But while her charm worked in almost anyone over eighteen-year-old – just bat her eyelashes and make some cute comment that would make all the adults go "oooh, isn't she cute?", Evelyn Blanchard (who hated being called grandma) was immune to anything that Audrey tried. She was a wall of ice and pragmatism with no time to spend with her only granddaughter."You want me to run into a wall?!", Audrey squalled. She wasn't a girl who complained easily about stuff – she liked to think of herself as overall lucky, and when not lucky, complaining never helped much – but asking her to run into a wall was a bit too much. If she were back at home, she had sure Ilvermony would never ask her to be part of such mess.How gauche, running into walls. Had Hogwarts any finesse?"I always knew my son was a bit of a useless excuse of wizard but had him failed to raise you to be any less stupid than him?", Evelyn cut her with no remorse. "Just run in the wall, silly girl. We don't have all day, it's just magic. I'm sure you know magic".Audrey huffed, and her fingers curled around the cart with her heavy trunk – her grandmother had made her pack her things three times, until all of her clothes had been perfectly folded, and scolded Audrey at least a thousand of times for almost forgetting something. "I'm a very bright girl. I won an estate award for my last essay, thank you very much", she sassed.Because it was true. Audrey wasn't stupid; of course, she hated maths with everything in her (after all, the numbers never made sense and it wasn't her fault1), but she excelled in almost everything else.Her grandmother's nostrils flared in anger. "Audrey, run at the wall"."No".Audrey was sure Evelyn was close to physically hitting her.But you see, it wasn't she was trying to be difficult (even if Audrey could be difficult sometimes), but she was angry. Terrible, awfully angry, with so much anger and resentment burning just under her skin, because her dad – who she always thought to be cool and all that – had woken up in the beginning of the summer and said:"I enrolled you at Hogwarts"Just that. No excuse, no whys, or I'm sorry. Just one "you are going to Europe in late August, darling, now can you pass me the maple syrup, please?"Audrey cried and made the biggest scandal her lungs could do. Then she cried some more, went on a hunger strike, and even tried to run away from home. Audrey even tried to argument or convince her dad – and she was very good convincing people to do what she wanted – but all her attempts had been futile. Apparently, her father didn't like her any more.What other reason was to send your only daughter to another country for almost all year?Audrey always wanted to go to Ilvermony, with her friends – Cal, and Liz and even Betty Fairchild, who cut her hair once when they were six years old, but suddenly she was the only one shipped to Hogwarts, where her dad had graduated before flying away from UK as soon as he could."For Merlin's sake, Audrey, just run at the wall before I throw you into it!", Evelyn threatened, her grey eyes – same eyes that Audrey's dad had, but completely different from her own blue ones – swirling with anger. "I'm not saying it again!""Great. Do you think any of grandpa's owls are quickly enough to get to Ilvermony before the start of term? I'm sure I'm not going to run into walls there! Problem solved!".Audrey tried her best smile. The one that make boys blush, girls lost her words and her dad buy her the new Barbie's dreamhouse – you know, the one that was almost her height. Audrey never knew if that smile was one of her things – a ability born with her, to bend people to her will, or if it was one of the mom's thing.Like her hair – melted silver, even if her dad was black-haired, or like eyes, or like the fact that she had not inherited the aquiline nose that all the Blanchards had. In fact, no one knew exactly what things Audrey had got from her mother – she never knew anyone like her, and her dad had no idea what else was in her blood but fair hair and pretty eyes.So far, she had never spite fireballs and neither had transformed into an angry bird. Again, overall lucky.Evelyn was ready to chop off her granddaughter's head (Audrey could almost see smoke coming out of her head). Audrey had never been surer of being ahead of a near-death experience – even worse than when she fell into an almost frozen lake in the middle of winter holiday when she was eight. Her dad had never been scary – a bit crazy, untrustworthy sometimes, but harmless as a little bunny – but his mother could define the meaning of scare.Audrey ended running into the wall, trunk and cat and everything else.And even if she was seething angry, furious even, with a lot of tears still stuck in her throat, Audrey took time to admire the magnificence of Hogwarts Express. She had seen trains, of course she had, but never paid much attention to them – old beasts of metal and smoke, roaring by the country. Audrey liked the elegance of her dad's expensive muggle cars better, with the feeling of the leather under her fingertips and the windows she could open and feel the wind in her hair.But the Hogwarts Express was something else, painted in black-and-red, almost too shiny to be built by anything else than magic itself, reflecting the warm sunlight that gently peaked from the glass ceiling. It was imposing and powerful and all the things that wizards and their world are meant to be, and Audrey let herself admire it.The platform ¾ was something else too, filled with a crowd of new and old students and their families, their voices mixed with the sound of owls and cats. The magic was impregnated all way around her, and she could fill her own under her skin, running in her veins.Audrey never had paid much attention to the fact she was a witch. It was something as normal as being a girl, or being blonde, or being a half-human. Being a witch was intrinsic and one of the things that defined Audrey Blanchard as Audrey Blanchard, but being there, in the way to school – even if wasn't the school she wanted – made her think of what it meant.Bubbling magic in her veins, with power in her hands. All the things she could do, the impossible, amazing things that being a witch meant."You are going to be late", Evelyn said somewhere behind Audrey, "if we don't find you a compartment soon"."And Blanchards are never rude enough to be late", she repeated. Her grandmother hands – pale, and bony, with long, elegant fingers full of expensive rings – latched in her shoulders, and guided Audrey between the crowd. Somewhere, she heard a boy talking about not being a monitor, and someone was gossiping about the boy they meet in the summer.They found her a compartment by the end of the train, still empty, and Evelyn put her trunk in the train with a flicker of the wand she always kept hidden in her sleeve, while Audrey hold the Cat's cage as hard as she could. She would be damned if her cat got lost in the middle of the train."Now, listen. Don't get in trouble; and we don't care in which house they put you if you get good grades. For Merlin's sake, Audrey, remember you are the Blanchard heiress. You must behave accordingly. Therefore, I hope to not receive any letters of poor conduct. I'm clear?"Audrey looked to her grandmother. Really, really looked. Evelyn used to be a beauty in her younger years – Audrey had seen the pictures in the Mansion, but it wasn't the beauty that made her famous.Was her ruthless mind and the cunning ways to get her family in the top of the world.Audrey could respect that.Respect her rules was another completely different thing."I will try", she said, in her best honey sweet voice, wearing a charming smile and all. Had Evelyn been anyone else, Audrey would probably have got a pat in the head and a compliment for that.But Evelyn was Evelyn and never liked Audrey very much. She shot the girl a withering gaze. "Audrey, I'm serious. If Albus send one word of bad conduct, I'm sending you to Durmstrang, and don't think your father are going to help you out, because he isn't the brightest of the sons I had, but not even him is that stupid"."Okay, gran. I'm going to be a good, nice, girl. Is that fine?""You better, for your own good", Evelyn sighed and closed the train door. "Goodbye, Audrey. Send word, darling"."Yeah. Bye, Evelyn"Audrey wasn't going to waste any drop of ink writing to home. No. Nope.No way. They didn't deserve her calligraphy – she had worked really hard on it, until she could write with a quill as good as she could with pen, and then even better, and she wasn't planning on using her abilities to write stuff to her family, who probably despised her.Maybe was one of the mom's things.Or maybe Audrey was just useless enough that not even her dad – who was her favourite person in the world – could bear living with her.Audrey sat by the little window, and her eyes watched as Evelyn – with her perfect grey hair and beautiful crimson dress, went away, until she disappeared. The last two weeks she had spent in London, with her grandparents, had been the most she had spent away from home. Audrey used to visit, as a little kid, but never without her dad and never to spend the whole year in a new school without any of her friends.Her throat burned.Cat meow from her cage, big, yellow eyes craved into Audrey, as if trying to say, "Are you going to let me lock up in here all day?"The girl sighed, before quickly opening the cage. Cat, the cat, was a big American bobtail that Audrey had got as a gift from her last anniversary in the last February. Since then, Cat had become her best friend."At least you aren't going to leave me, are you?"Cat meowed again, with her yellowish eyes.The door compartment slid open with a little screech. Audrey instinctively hugged Cat tighter; she had no idea how Hogwarts students are. Do they pick on the younger girls? Are they going to make fun of her because she had an accent? Can they find out who her mother is?Audrey was ready to throw Cat to anyone who dared to annoy her when a round, baby faced boy around her age came in. He was probably a bit shorter than Audrey, with a mass of blonde hair in his head and a dread-stricken face by the fact the compartment he chooses had a girl on it. "S-sorry".She smiled. Not her golden-winning smile, the one that probably was going to kill the boy, but her I'm-nice smile. "Do you want to sit? I'm all alone".He looked unsure, shuffling his feet, before deciding by himself and sitting down in the seat in her front. Audrey smiled a bit more, just to be sure. People liked when she smiled. "I'm Audrey", she stretched one of her hands, and Cat hissed.The boy flushed a deep red, before taking her hand in his in a sloppy handshake. "Neville. Neville Longbottom. Are you – ", he cleared his throat, "are you a first year too?""Yeah. And this is Cat, the cat. She doesn't like boys, so it's better if you don't pat her, but she is a nice girl".Are you going to be my friend? Audrey wanted to scream. Neville looked sheepishly, and a bit of too soft, with his baby fat and round face, but Audrey had no friends here. She wanted friends."Oh, yeah", he looked to the cat in her arms. Then his hands went to one of his pockets, and Audrey made a confuse frown. "This is Trevor".She almost screamed because Trevor was a toad. Not a nice, cute cat, nor a funny, small rat, but a toad. She had never ever put her hands in a toad, and honestly, they looked a bit weird and all that. She gulped and tried a smile, because Neville wasn't that bad, and he probably liked his toad.Oh well, at least that thing was going to be in his dormitory and not in hers."Hello Trevor!", she squawked and hugged Cat a bit closer, just because she wasn't looking exactly happy about the other animal. Audrey was a bit scared of Cat jumping in the boy just to catch the toad and that was not how you start a friendship.The door of the compartment opened again, just as the train started to walk. This time, it was a girl, with bushy, brown hair and already wearing the Hogwarts uniform that had made Audrey wrinkle her nose the first time she had seen it. Her dark eyes went from Neville to Audrey at least twice before she made up her mind. "Hey. Sorry, almost all the other compartments are full. Can I sit there?"Audrey quickly thought that the probabilities of this girl having some weird pet too are low, so she smiled the best she could. "Yeah, sure! I'm Audrey Blanchard, and this is Neville Longbottom. What's your name?"The girl looked at her. "Blanchard, like Edward Thorne-Blanchard? I've read about him; his spells are famous and very interesting. I hope they teach some of them to us, not in the first year, of course, but would be terrible useful to know some of them. Anyway, I'm Hermione Granger".Audrey blinked."Yeah, I think he is my great-grandfather or something like that".Hermione sited down by her side and folded her hands in her lap. "I'm so excited to see Hogwarts! I've read all about it in Hogwarts: A History, because I wanted to know the rules, and the history of the castle – do you know how old the castle is? – and how everything works, because you know, no one in family is magic at all. I'm so excited, because Hogwarts is the best magic school that exists, and having a good education is a decisive factor in life success."Audrey blinked again and looked at Neville. He didn't look like he had read Hogwarts: A History either."My family is almost all magic, I think", Audrey said. "But I thought I was going to another school. Not Hogwarts"."Are you American?", Hermione asked, suddenly curious. "I've read about some schools of witchcraft in America! Are they as good as Hogwarts, aren't they?"Audrey blinked again. That girl could speak, and fast.And was in her moment of shock by the quickly paced speech of Hermione Granger that everything went to hell, because Cat choose her owner's moment of listlessness to pounce directly into Neville's arms, where Trevor, the toad, was being safely kept.a/n: its 4a.m i should be sleeping but i've wrote probably 15 pages for this fanfiction. next chapter will be up tomorrow or after that, depends on how quickly i can edit it.also, english isn't my first language. i'm writing this fanfiction not just for fun, but because i need to improve my writing skills (and also because i'm locked in my house since march because of covid-19). if you find any mistakes, please feel free to point them. thank you so much, and please stay safe out there.love,star.

So originally this book was posted on Wattpad with pictures of what actors or actresses I thought each character looked like so I wouldn't have to describe them but didn't add them. So instead for Lily Evans picture Karen Gillan, For James Potter picture Aaron Taylor Johnson, For Sirius Ben Barnes, Remus Lupin Andrew Garfield, For Peter Jamie Bell, For Marlene as Freya Mavor, Alice Fortescue as Carey Mulligan, Mary Macdonald as Kaya Scodelario and as Dorcas Meadows, Kate Graham.Main CharactersLily Evans 16 January 30, 1960, returning to school as a prefect and amazing grades she earned from the previous year. She has a goal to not only avoid the death eaters but to protect her friends as well. She is extremely worried about the situation going on outside the school and is extremely scared of what can happen to her family. She is also hoping to avoid both the attention of her ex-best friend Severus Snape and her "enemy" James Potter. After an incredibly horrible summer in which her sister treated her like absolute crap, she is excited to see her friends again. She is a somewhat popular girl and smart, she is 5'4 130 lbs. She is not on the Quidditch team although she loves to attend games. She is a member of the slug club and she has a doe Patronus. For Lily, I believe she is the INFJ the advocate. (Introverted, Intuition, Feeling, Judging) I think she has a deep sense of idealism and integrity but can speak with great passion and conviction. She strives to do what's right and wants to help people in her life. I think she is creative, insightful, principled, passionate, and Altruistic. I think the weaknesses are she can sometimes be sensitive to criticism, reluctant to open up, perfectionistic, avoiding the ordinary, and prone to burnout. I think in relationships, she takes the process of finding a romantic partner seriously and prefers not to settle until the ideal match is found. It can take time and results in her ending relationships due to having unrealistic expectations. In friendships, I think she prefers to have a close circle of confidants and once she connects with someone, she will open up more and share everything with them. She has a high standard for herself and therefore, she has high expectations for her friends.James Potter 16, Birthdate 27 March 1960 returning to school knowing he has to change if his friends are going to last the year. Over the summer, Sirius Black ran away and was left with an extremely fragile state. Not only that Remus Lupin and Sirius's relationship is still struggling to recover after the trick Sirius played the previous years. Also, his dreams are littered with what might happen if the full Moon goes array. On top of that, he is worried about his parents who are in the order and has to deal with peter struggling in classes. This goes along with the increasing danger of future death eaters in the castle. He is also, the only member of his friends who knows that the Triwizard Tournament is returning to the castle and that he might enter. He not only popular, smart, and a chaser on the Gryffindor quidditch team. He is 6'1, 160 lbs and has a stag Patronus. He has a giant red stag Animagus. For me, James was impossible to decide because I could see him being either the Commander or the Protagonist. Ultimately, I decided on Commander because the Protagonist type is unable to make hard-decisions, unlike James. He is a natural-born leader who has confidence, authority, and draws. Crowds together. He is rational, smart, and resilient. He loves a good challenge and with enough time he and resources he can do absolutely anything. He will push through in areas when everyone else would rather give up. He is efficient, energetic, self-confident, strong-willed, strategic thinker, and charismatic and inspiring. I think he can also be stubborn, intolerant, impatient, arrogant, poor handling of emotions, and ruthless. In a relationship, James will approach relationships with a goal and a plan to achieve them. In relationships, they put a lot of effort into both the short term and the long term. I think with friendship, he befriends people who share a passion for deep, discussions, who enjoy learning and development as much as he does. With his friends, he is willing to do just about anything for his friends and defending from anything coming at them in any direction.Marlene Mackinnon 16, October 15, 1959. She comes into this year worrying about her family and older siblings she is leaving behind as the world is becoming a dangerous place and her family is in order. She is a member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the Chaser and is an extremely popular girl. She comes from a decently wealthy pureblood family and has two older brothers. She is an extremely attractive girl and popular as well. She has a curvy figure, that is also muscular. She is 5'8 150 lbs. Her Patronus is a very playful otter. In my mind, she is the Entertainer or ESFP (Extroverted, Observant, Feeling, Perceptive), I think she is popular and the type of person who turns everything into a party. Sociable, she loves simple things and spending time with friends.s She has an eye for fashion and has her own style. She often forgets her homework or other responsibilities as she gets caught up in having fun. I think she is bold, original has showmanship, practical, observant, and has extremely good people skills. I think, however, she is also sensitive, conflict-averse, easily bored, not a long-term planner, and unfocused. She is also the type to have fun in relationships and does not focus on dating for the future. She is the one who brings spark and energy to her group of friends constantly wanting to do something fun.Alice Fortescue 16, 25 August 1960 She comes from a pureblood family that wasn't necessarily wealthy and whose uncle owns the Ice cream shop. Heading into the Sixth year, she is trying to keep her head down and avoid attracting any attention from the death eaters that would hurt her family outside of school. She is not a Quidditch player, nor is she the most popular girl in school, but she does fairly well in school. Dreams of becoming an Aurora. She is rather petite being 5'3, 140 lbs but can dish out some rather nasty hexes and jinxes. Her Patronus is a Seal. In my opinion, Alice is the Logistician or ISTJ (introverted, observant, thinking, judging) as I believe she is the type of person who has integrity, practical logic, and has a strong sense of duty. She has patience and is able to take a calm and relaxed approach to problems. I think she is honest and direct, strong-willed, responsible, calm and practical, create and enforce order, jack of all trades. I also believe she is stubborn, insensitive, always by the book, judgmental, often unreasonably blames herself. With dating, I believe Alice is the type to find the right person and to hold onto them no matter what. They take the slow methodical approach, they do not rush or force things, dedicating time for friendships to develop.Mary Macdonald Birthday 16, 18 July 1960, She comes from a muggleborn family is increasingly worried about the situation of Hogwarts. She was hurt seriously the previous year by Mulciber and Avery. She is struggling to get over this incident as often she wakes up with both panic and fear. Her goal for the year is to get through it with little to no incidents and with the Slytherins leaving her alone. She is 5'4 125 lbs. Her Patronus is a Tonkinese Cat. In my opinion, Mary is INFP the Mediator, introverted, intuitive, feeling, perceiving. I believe she has a caring nature and values harmony and empathy. She has a great inner nature and loves to daydream. She is thoughtful, generous, open-minded, creative, passionate, loyal to her values, overly idealistic, impractical, self-critical, emotionally driven, and difficult to get to know and conflict adverse. In relationships, she is a dreamer and therefore I believe she looks for true love and does not want to have anything short of that. Once they do find that person they are completely loyal to the relationship. Despite being an introvert, she still loves to spend time with her small group of friends, once she knows she can trust them.Dorcas Meadows 16 Birthday 1st of August 1960, she is a rather fierce half-blood coming back to school looking to protect her friends from the Death Eaters and a fierce determination to make a difference in the world. She is hoping to get great grades and fight in the war against Voldemort. Becoming increasingly aware of the dangers facing her Family. She is an extremely fierce person who excels in DADA, Charms, and Potions. She is a badass. She has a White Stallion Patronus that is seriously unique. She is a seeker on the Gryffindor quidditch team. She is extremely muscular 5'11, 175 lbs. in my opinion Dorcas is the Executive or the supervisor. She loves law and order and she enjoys getting the job done. She loves working in a group as long as who she's working with are hard-working and dedicated. She is extroverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging she is dedicated, strong-willed, Direct and Honest, loyal, reliable, patient, an excellent organizer and enjoys creating an order. She can too inflexible and stubborn. Uncomfortable with unconventional situations, judgmental, difficult to relax, and expressing emotion. In relationships, she is honest and direct and she, therefore, behaves the same from beginning to end. In friendships, she is the one who constantly organizes activities and practices.Remus Lupin 16, Birthday March 10, 1960. He is still struggling to deal with his lycanthropy after the incident with Severus Snape the year before and the marauders becoming animagi. In my opinion, he's from wales and therefore speaks welsh better than English. His family generally treats him like a monster and a beast when they think he isn't paying attention. He is extremely studious and smart, and the mastermind of a lot of the marauder's pranks. Gets less attention than his best friends. Patronus is a wolf and is 6'3 150 lbs, rather skinny, with scars littering his body. He worries constantly about his friends and deep down is worried about becoming a monster. In my opinion, he is ISFJ the defender or introverted, observant, feeling, and Judging. I think he has excellent analytical abilities, as well as great people skills. I think he is reliable, and a bit of a perfectionist. He is supportive, reliable, and patient, imaginative and observant, Enthusiastic, Loyal, and Hard-working, and good practical skills. His weaknesses are that he is humble and shy, takes things too personally, repress their feelings, overloads himself, and is too Altruistic. I think in romantic relationships, he is originally shy and therefore it takes time to get him to open up. Once he opens up, he becomes a dedicated and loyal partner. I think in friendships, Remus is shy and does not open up easily so it takes persistence to become friends with him.Sirius Black: 16, Birthday November 3rd, 1959. The story begins the school year after he runs away from his home and disowned by his abusive family. He played as a beater for the Gryffindor quidditch team is 5'9 and 170 lbs. Extremely attractive gets a lot of girls' attention. He speaks French, and is one of the best in the school at dueling, and has a somewhat vast knowledge of both the dark arts and healing charms. He has a dog Patronus and began a dog Animagus that looks like the Grimm. He will spend a lot of time on his hair, and he will have both anxiety and suffer from depression. For Sirius, he is an ESTP personality, the Entrepreneur as I believe his character is extroverted, observant, Thinking, and Perceiving. I think he always the center of attention or being the entertainment. He is pretty smart, but he would rather go out and do something, rather than theorize it. He does not look before he leaps and fixes their mistakes as they go. I think he struggles in school as he does not do well with rules. He is bold, rational, and practical, original, perceptive, direct, sociable. I think on the other hand he is insensitive, impatient, risk-prone, Defiant, and unstructured. In romantic relationships, he is more focused on having fun, instead of focusing on the future or a long-term relationship. In his friendships, he is the one with new ideas and suggestions.Peter Pettigrew: 16 Birthday 9 September 1960, He begins after receiving not the best OWL's results from the year before. He is extremely scarred with the situation starting to brew outside and knows that his friends are going to be fighting in the front line and he will have no choice but to follow this or else he thinks he will lose his friends. He is a member of the group given the least amount of attention. He doesn't do so well in most of the classes and requires the assistance of both Remus and James. He has a rat Patronus and Animagus. He definitely has confidence issues and is bullied by the Slytherins when he is alone. As a character, he is not as attractive as his friends as he is 5'7shortest of the marauders 180 lbs. Not very athletic however, he does love the sport. In my opinion, Peter is ESFJ or the Consul. (Extroverted, Observant, Feeling, Judging). He is the one concerned with gossip, practical matter, and social status. He loves to be of service and loves to be valued and has strong practical skills, very loyal, sensitive, and warm, good at connecting with others. I think he is worried about social status, inflexible, vulnerable to criticism, and often too needy. To Peter, each stage of dating is important and his goal is to create understanding from early on. He can become hurt when insulted creating problems. In friendship, he is warm and loyal, standing by his friends offering emotional support and encouragement.(All art credit goes to original artists / photographers & all original characters to )Disclaimer ️: includes mature language, graphic content and sexual references and Characters will die

(Sept 1st 1976)James POVI woke up early in my room in Potter Manor right as the Sun was beginning to rise. I could not help but watch and enjoy the picturesque view as the sun shines light across the forest in our backyard. I get changed putting on my clothes and prepare to go running before breakfast. I find it is an activity that is helpful in clearing my head, staying in shape and composing my thoughts. As I begin to run, I think about how I will be returning to Hogwarts today, my second home, the place where I met my three best friends. Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. Thinking about my three best friends, it reminds me of what a mess this summer was. Sirius Black, Padfoot, my brother, finally ran away from his childhood home after years of abuse. When I think back to the night Sirius showed up on our front steps. He was bleeding, could barely stand and had tears running down his face. It took me hours to calm him down as he was shaking and trembling in my arms, struggling to breathe. I can still picture it even a month after it happened. Since that day, my parents have basically adopted him and he is slowly getting better. I know he has been scarred permanently both mentally and physically but I am going to be with him every step of the way. I will never give up on him. I spent this summer calming Sirius down when he had panic attacks and putting the pieces back together. Sirius wasn't the only one worrying me, as my other best friend, my brother Remus Lupin or Moony also struggled all this summer. Moony is a werewolf and believes that due to this he is a monster. He is not and will never be a monster, as Moony is one of the best people I have ever met. Ever since the incident at the end of our fifth year, where Sirius told Snape how to get past the whomping willow on a full moon, Moony hasn't been the same. I still feel so scared remembering that night, how I followed Snape to the willow and pulled him out the way just in time, I got a nice scar for my effort. Somehow Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Snape not to speak a word of it. It has been troubling Moony how close he came to hurting someone and reinforced Moony's idea that he is a monster. Also, this summer my best friends and I, the Marauders as we have dubbed ourselves, have perfected our animagi transformations and how to deal with a werewolf on a full moon. I know deep down our animagi transformation worries Moony and he is scared to hurt us. But that doesn't matter to us, our transformations help him and therefore, we are going to continue doing them. I spent most of the summer, reinforcing the idea that he is my brother and that he is not a monster. My last brother Peter or Wormtail was reeling this summer after his poor OWL results added to his already low self-esteem. He has always been bullied for his looks and less than stellar intelligence. I always make sure to compliment Peter or offer him sweets when he feels particularly down. That's why it hurt seeing Wormtail so down this summer, as he is normally such a happy and funny person. I spent most of my summer trying to cheer him up with various sweets and helping plan where to go from here. It's been a bad summer, all round. I can't wait to return to Hogwarts.I start to up my speed to hurry and make it home on time. Once I reach the front steps, I hear Sirius is awake and talking to my mom in the Kitchen.As I enter, I shout to my mom "I'm taking a shower, then I'll be down for breakfast mum."My mom shouts back "Okay, but hurry up, we don't want to miss the train."I rush upstairs and quickly take off my clothes and hop in the shower. I quickly wash and then dry myself. I walk over to the mirror and quickly run my hand through my messy jet black hair. Through the years it has become a nervous habit of mine. As I run downstairs my mind quickly flits to Hogwarts and wondering what this year is going to be like. I know this year is going to be different. I need to step up, I need to be there for my friends and protect them. No one is going to touch them. I enter the kitchen to see my mom, my dad and Padfoot sitting round the table and I can't help but smile about my family. I quickly grab a piece of toast and sit down joining the table. They begin discussing the world outside and Sirius and I begin to discuss what pranks were going to pull this year.Timeskip to the stationSirius and I pass through the Barrier at platform 9 3/4 to the see the Hogwarts express the large steam engine that will take us to Hogwarts. We quickly deposit our trunks in our marauders compartment marked with our initials. Sirius and I walk back out and head to say goodbye to our Mom and Dad."Bye Mum, Bye Dad" I say at the same time as Sirius. I hug my Mom and Dad tightly and without shame. As I let go, Sirius quickly takes my place and hugs them tightly.Before leaving, my mom says "please, stay out of trouble and look after each other."At the same time, Padfoot and I tell her "We will do our best to stay out of trouble but trouble will find us."We head back towards the train when we see two younger students struggling to lift their trunks. We make are way over there and I ask, "do you need some help?"A girl with brown hair and black eyes and light skin exchanged a look with her friend who looks similar brown hair, black eyes but with chestnut-colored skin then says, "Yes please."We hoist up the trunks and carry them onto the train and find an empty compartment to store them. Before leaving I turn and say, "if you guys need anything just let us know, I am James Potter and this is my best friend Sirius Black."The same girl who answered before said "thank you, I'm Samantha Rose, and this is my friend Teri Gardner, she speaks French better than English."Sirius then speaks up and says "Si vous besoins plus d'aide juste demande nous et nous pouvons aider. Je m'appelle Sirius Black et lui est James Potter."The girl looks up surprised and replies "Ca c'est tres gentil merci beaucoup."Sirius and I nod before leaving the compartment to head to our own. As we are walking I feel Sirius elbow me in the ribs to get my attention and I see in front of me is Lily Evans. Lily Evans the girl I have a crush on, the girl who rejected me rather publicly after I asked her out inappropriately. Lily Evans also happens to be a girl with a fiery temper and rather serious hate for me, due to my rivalry with her ex-best friend, pureblood supremacist, Severus Snape. We still see each other fairly often due to being in the same house Gryffindor, being in the same year, and sharing the same friend group. This year I was hoping to interact with Lily as little as possible as I need to be there for my friends and getting mixed up and yelled at by Lily won't do me any good.Sirius seems to have other ideas as he shouts out "Hey Lilikins, how are you!" Might I add Sirius and Lily have a newfound friendship to replace the previously held hatred?Lily turns around and replies "Hey Sirius, Potter, I'm doing alright. How was your summer?"Sirius replies carefully, clearly wanting to avoid the subject "not that bad, how was yours?"In a similar fashion, Lily says "it was fine."I nudge Sirius hopefully discreetly and mutter "We're going to be late meeting the other marauder's let's go."Apparently, it didn't go unnoticed by Lily as something flashed in her eyes. Padfoot seemed to grasp the situation and said a quick goodbye to Lily as we made our way past.As we enter the compartment we hear an excited shout from Peter and Remus "Prongs, Padfoot!"I quickly say "Moony, Wormtail" just as eagerly back. We needed to get down to business before Remus goes to the prefect meeting.I quickly say "Marauder's I call to order the 6th annual meeting of the Marauders on the Hogwarts express. Is everyone present?""Moony Present" Remus answers"Padfoot reporting for duty" Sirius answers"Wormtail here as always" Peter answers"Then let's begin with the planning of our annual start of term prank. Any ideas?" I ask.Remus's face immediately lights up and he seems to have a wide grin etching his way onto his face. Moony says "I've got a great idea and it's going to be epic." We immediately start planning and hardening out the finer details.Timeskip to when Remus leaves for the Prefect MeetingAs Remus leaves for the Prefect Meeting, four new faces enter the compartment. I stand up and walk over before embracing two of the new faces in giant bear hugs. Marlene Mackinnon and Alice Longbottom, who are like my sisters. I remember the day I met them when I was 5, our families were all purebloods but not members of the Sacred 28. We grew up together, took lessons together, they were my best friends before coming to Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, Marlene and I are as close as anyone, we play Quidditch together, she tells me everything and I tell her everything (except about Remus being a werewolf, the fact that I am an illegal animagus as they aren't my secrets). Alice and I have a much quieter bond, but we have a special bond, we don't need words or to say anything, we are just always there for one and other. I turn around and face the other two girls, Dorcas Meadows and Mary Macdonald. Mary and I aren't exactly close I would say at best we're friends. We have the same friends, so we are polite with one and other. Finally, there's Dorcas Meadows, who is my close friend and who is a badass. We became friends the day I told the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain to go fuck himself after he was being a sexist dick towards Dorcas at try outs. I walk over and hug her too. After completing our hellos, we all sit down and begin recounting our tales of summer.Lily's POVI wake up to the sound of my alarm and jump awake and remember this is the day I return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I quickly prepare what I am going to wear and then head to take a shower before breakfast. In the shower, I can't help but think about the summer and how terrible it's been. My sister has been treating me absolutely terribly, calling me a freak and looking at me like I'm different. At Hogwarts, I get called mudblood by the pureblood supremacists and treated like a freak. The last thing I needed was for the same thing to happen at home but here we are. I hate how I do not belong anywhere. What is worse is the fact that I still have to see my ex best friend Severus Snape around the town of Cokeworth. Every time I see him, I am reminded of the day he finally called me a mudblood. I knew before then that he was obsessed with the dark arts and that he might have called others mudblood but I just didn't want to believe it. My friends even warned about such a thing but I chose to ignore them. I shake all those negative thoughts out of my head and head downstairs, to get breakfast. I can't help but look at the table and see my dad reading the paper and my mom cooking. No Petunia, maybe this will be a nice meal. I say "hi" quickly before taking a seat. My mom bring me a plate of pancakes that are delicious. I begin to dig in when I glance over at the paper my dad's reading. I can't help but notice another strange disappearance has happened. They have been happening more and more frequently showing Voldemort's power growing. Voldemort is a dark wizard, who is terrorizing the magical world. His agenda is to rid the magical world of anyone who isn't pureblood. To him, me and every other muggleborn do not belong in the magical world and should be killed. He is gaining followers called the death eaters quickly and killing anyone who stands in his way. At school, there is a group of students who are all obsessed with the dark arts and pureblood supremacy and are planning to join him after school and hunt down people like me. This of course includes my ex best friend Severus Snape. Everyone in the wizarding world says war is brewing. I do my best to keep my parents in the dark about how dark the wizarding world is getting but it is becoming harder and harder. I constantly worry for their safety and my own safety as I myself am going to be the target for pureblood supremacists during my upcoming year at Hogwarts. I just hope I can keep my good grades and avoid any incidents. My mind wanders back to my parents as I hear my mom call my name. "Lily, Lily are you listening?""Sorry mom, I zoned out for a second, what was it?" I asked"You, Petunia, and I are going to the train station right after breakfast, we'll drop you off first, then Petunia and I are going shopping if that's okay?" My mom repeats.I smiled and say "Sure, mom that's fine."Timeskip to the train stationI walk past platform nine and 3/4 and see the Hogwarts Express in all its glory. I wave at a couple of students I recognize before heading onto the train. I place my trunk on the shelf and start to look for my boyfriend and my friends. I find my boyfriend first, Thomas Linnety a Hufflepuff Prefect in the same year as me. We met on rounds together after Remus was out sick. He is a smart, quiet, and caring person. He has beady eyes the color of the afternoon sky. His silky, straight, medium-length hair is the color blonde and is worn in an attractive style. He is tall and has a lithe build. His skin is white. He has a pointed chin. After spending hours together in the library, he finally asked me out. We went together on the last Hogsmeade trip of 5th year. We've been sending letters all summer. I walk over and hug him tightly as he is not one for PDA or attention."Thomas, I missed you" I say happily,"I definitely missed you too, Lily." He replies."I'm going to go find the girls as I want to see them before the Prefect meeting. Is it okay if we catch up right after the prefects meeting?" I ask"Yes, of course, I don't mind. Go find your friends, I know it's been a while since you have seen them." He repliesI swiftly kiss him on the cheek before going to look for the girls. As I am heading down the train, I hear someone shout out "Hey Lilikins, How are you?"Only one person calls me Lilikins, I quickly turn around and see Sirius Black and James Potter approaching me. Sirius Black and I have a rocky relationship, I used to hate him and James Potter equally as they were both arrogant, bulling prats who tortured my ex-best friend Severus Snape. Then one day, Sirius found me crying over a letter from my sister. He was able to calm me down and opened up about his own family life. After that, we formed a rather tentative friendship. James Potter on the other hand is a complete jerk, who is so arrogant and full of himself. He always messes up his hair to make it look like he just got off a broomstick making half the girls in the school swoon. He is always pulling pranks and causing mischief with his three best friends, the marauders as they dubbed themselves. They include Remus Lupin, my close friend who is rather tamed compared to the other troublemakers, my friend Sirius Black, Potters partner in crime, and Peter Pettigrew, who worships the ground Potter and Sirius walk on. They are the most popular boys in our year. They act like they own the place just because they are extremely smart, the most popular students and Potter is one of the best quidditch players in the school, they think they own the place, strutting around everywhere and acting superior to everyone else. Okay, Sirius and Remus aren't that bad, it is really just Potter, the leader, the most arrogant of them all. I don't understand why so many people like him. He's so annoying, and always arguing with me when I tell him off. Even worse, he had the audacity to ask me out twice last year, including while bullying my ex-friend. I hate him with a passion. I only ever hang out with him because we share common friends. My friends always say he's not so bad but they are wrong. He just always irritates me and worst of all I can rarely win against him. He never backs down or shrinks away from my anger. He's such a prat and a fake. I then notice that weirdly Potter is as eager as I am to have this conversation.I refocus my attention on the conversation and reply "Hey Sirius, Potter, I'm doing alright. How was your summer?"Sirius who doesn't seem eager to talk about his summer replies "not that bad, how was yours?"I was equally unwilling to go into my summer as I had no wish to talk about Petunia. So, I answer "it was fine."I see Potter elbow Sirius and mention something about being late.Sirius seems to understand that Potter doesn't really want to talk to me and so he says a quick goodbye before hurrying after Potter. I couldn't help but be a little surprised because Potter never openly ignored me like that, but maybe I could get through the year without having to yell or scream at him. I continue to search until I locate my friends Marlene Mackinnon, Alice Fortescue, Dorcas Meadows, and Mary Macdonald. Mary and I have been close friends ever since we met in the library 1st year. We are both have similar interests, are quiet, and like to avoid parties as much as possible. Alice Fortescue and I met at the Hogwarts feast in 1st year and we bonded over our unique thinking and love of having a project to do. She taught me everything I needed to know about the magical world. Dorcas Meadows, the girl I met in 1st year after she stood up for me against a couple of older pureblood students. She is very protective of me and always giving me honest but blunt advice. Finally, Marlene Mackinnon my sister in all but blood, she is there with me every step of the way, making sure to get me out of my shell and to have fun. As I enter the compartment, I find Marlene and Dorcas having an argument over who is the best quidditch team. Then, there is Mary who is drawing a picture of the passing scenery. Finally, Alice is reading a book that seems to be a wizard fiction book.As I enter she is the first to see me and says "hey Lily" which seems to break the others out of their activities as they all say Hi to.I sit down and ask, "How was your summer guys?"Marlene Mackinnon immediately went into a detailed account about her action boy packed summer. When she finished her story about sleeping with this foreign French boy, she turns to me and asks, "How was Petunia this summer?""She was the usual, I kind of wish I didn't have to deal with her, but she's my sister I can just hope that at one point she will treat me like a sister again." I reply"You need to stop trying to rationalize her behavior, your sister is a jealous bitch and you shouldn't waste your time with her." Dorcas put bluntly"Dorcas" Alice hissedI was shocked I mean I knew my sister was a bitch, but that doesn't mean you give up on her, I mean you shouldn't give up on family. I still wasn't sure how to reply and Mary sensing my need for a change in topic engaged Marlene in the popular gossip of the school."Marlene did you hear about the drama going on with the 5th year students""You mean the one where Tim Stephenson and Mason McLaggen the most popular boys in fifth year, have crushes on Tessa Wilkinson and Hannah Lyons from the rather nerdy group" Marlene replied"I meant the part that Brooklyn Martin who is friends with Tim and Mason has started to bully Tessa because Brooklyn has a rather large crush on Tim." Mary answersI know Tessa she is a Ravenclaw and a rather kind and nice girl. She is probably going to make prefect this year. I've spoken to her several times in the library and I actually know she has a huge crush on Tim. It hurts to hear she is getting bullied for it. I will need to talk to her after the prefects meeting."You guys do know Tessa has a crush on Tim right?" I answered smuglyMary and Marlene both looked like I had offered them pure gold. And then they along with Alice start to squeal.Alice is the first to speak up "that is so cute they are so going to be a cute couple."The talk of gossip continues until it is time for the prefect's meetings. I say goodbye and head to the meeting. I notice first the head boy is Frank Longbottom an obvious choice as he is a strong-willed, natural-born leader. He has thick brown hair that is worn in a short buzz cut type. He is tall and has a muscular build. His skin is pale. He has a weak chin. Alice has had this huge crush on him since the fourth year. The head girl is Hestia Jones a kind, smart, athletic and caring girl, who always helps out everyone in the hallways. She has tanned skin, black hair rather muscular build, and has soft blue eyes. I watch as the rest of the prefects enter. From Gryffindor, there are 5th years Brooklyn Martin and Dirk Cresswell, Brooklyn Martin! that's the bitch whose bully Tessa! My partner in 6th year is my good werewolf friend Remus Lupin. He doesn't know I know he is a werewolf; it would just make things awkward. Remus and I are super close, he is like my older brother, I trust him with all my secrets and we spend a lot of time studying in the library together. 7th years are Cadaroc Dearborn and Britta Macmillan both rather popular and kind students. From Hufflepuff, in 5th year Nick Murray and Cara Birch both kind people, I see Cara around a lot, she's involved in most things in the school. Nick is best friends with Mason and Tim who the girls were gossiping about. 6th year was Thomas Linnety and Andy Reid, Thomas is my boyfriend and Andy is apparently a kind, hard-working person but I don't know her well. 7th year Reggienal Cattermole and Kristy Dennis, I only know Reggienal for having a crush on Mary. For Ravenclaw 5th year Ash Selwyn and Tessa Wilkinson I know both of them well enough, they are smart and kind and always respectful. 6th year Benjy Fenwick and Emmeline Vance, they are friends of mine, who always stand up for what they believe in. They also make a very cute couple. 7th Year is Regan Adams and Bertram Aubrey, I know Bertram well I went on one date with him, he is an arrogant, pompous git who still has a crush on me. Finally, the Slytherin prefects 5th year Amycus Carrow and Alecto Carrow twins who are going to join the death eaters. 6th Year Severus Snape and Milly Hudson. I know Severus well-being my ex-best friend another dark arts obsessed prefect. 7th Year Pam Parkinson and Evan Rosier both will probably end up in the death eater circle, Evan Rosier is the leader of the future death eaters at school.Timeskip to the end of the prefect meetingI tell Remus I would see him later and walk over to Brooklyn Martin intent on telling her to leave Tessa alone but before I could I felt someone tugging on my arm."Please Lily I need to talk to you." Severus says"I don't want anything to do with you" I spit"Why, all those years done the drain for one word" Severus replies angrilyI am done with his bullshit and lies. "It was more than one word it was years of being obsessed with the dark arts and bullying students. I don't want anything to do with you and your dark art obsession. I'm done making excuses." I shout.Before Severus could reply Hestia came over and asks, "is there a problem over here."Severus quickly replies "no" and walks awayI turn around and say, "thanks Hestia, you're a lifesaver, congratulations on Head girl.""Thanks," She saysI walk off to find Thomas and to catch up. I quickly find him waiting in the corridor for me. I smile happily and walk over."tell me did you read the new Agatha Christie novel it was such a fascinating read." I ask eagerly"You know that's not my type of book Lily, I do not like murder." he replied quietly.I felt guilty for forgetting that he scares easily. I should have remembered that. Shaking my head, I quickly say "Sorry, my bad, I forgot. In your last letter though you mentioned you were reading this new book."He smiles and answers "Don't worry about it. My family took a trip to the states as you read in my letter, so I was able to find this book called A river runs through it and other stories. It's about the inner-workings of a town and the role of a son, father, and husband."I can't help but smile I love to talk about books even books I am not hugely interested in. This one would not be too high on my list but I still enjoyed hearing about it."So, the trip to America, did you get to see anything magical there?" I ask"Not exactly I mean I was with my mom the entire time, since my dad was hunting the magical creature, I didn't get to do anything magical. I mean I wasn't too upset as it was nice to just be muggle for once." He answeredI remembered then that his dad was a monster hunter and that the trip was for work, not just a vacation. I couldn't help but wonder how he found it so easy to drift between the two worlds. I mean I guess he has a parent who can understand his muggle side and a parent to understand his magical side. My parents could never understand my world no matter how well I can describe it. As my mind was drifting I knew I needed to say something."Did you hear about the new developments on a potion to help cure lycanthropy." I ask"No, I mean I guess it doesn't really concern me, but if it is able to keep werewolves at bay and prevent them from hurting innocent people then that sounds great." He repliesI wish I could talk about these kinds of things with someone but no one wants to talk about advanced magic or listen to me ramble on about potions. I found my friends sitting in the marauder's compartment as I expected and quickly waved at everyone as I was entering. I was surprised by what was going on. A game of exploding snap was going on between Peter and Sirius, although it looked like Sirius was winning. Mary was drawing again, while also engaging in a conversation with Dorcas about fashion. Alice and Remus were conversing quietly about what sounds to be classes. What surprised me, is Potter seemed to be reading very quickly mind you a book on advanced charm that even I haven't read. Marlene was sleeping on his shoulder. He doesn't even look up when I enter just continues reading. I sit down and eventually enter the conversation with Remus and Alice about who they think the new DADA teacher will be. The conversation eventually became about OWLs results and what NEWTs we were thinking of taking.Remus went first and says "I got O's in DADA, Charms, Potions, Arithmancy and Herbology, E's in History of magic, transfiguration, and Astronomy. I'm planning on taking DADA, Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, Arithmancy, Herbology."Alice went next and says "I got O's in DADA, Charms, Herbology, E's in everything else. I am taking DADA, Potions, Charms, Herbology, Transfiguration, Astronomy."They looked at me expectantly and so I tell them "I got O's in everything except Transfiguration where I got an E. This year I am taking DADA, Potions, Charms, Herbology, Transfiguration, Alchemy."At this point Potter looks up for the first time and asks, "You're taking Alchemy, you'll have to tell me about that class since there is so little about the subject in the library."I am taken aback by this, why would Potter have an interest in such an obscure branch of magic. I still nod and say "of course, what about you, how did the great James Potter do on his OWLs?"Potter ignores the comment and rolls his eyes at me and then in a calm but confident voice says, "All O's, and I am planning on taking DADA, Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, Herbology, Magical Theory."I am stunned he scored better than me and didn't even have to study, this really ticks me off, and why magical theory, that has to be the most boring class in the world, even worse than Binn's History of magic. Letting the anger get the better of me I spit "how did you score all O's you didn't even study, and magical theory, that has to be the most boring subject there is, why would you take that?"When my anger takes over people usually shy away and back down but Potter has always been the exception. He calmly but with a clear threat in his voice replies "Well, Princess, I happen to do a lot of extra-curricular activities involving magic." He pauses then continues "in these activities I have gained a broad understanding of many types of magic which is why I understand things so well without studying. As well, Magical theory might be boring to you but is the key to all my success. By understanding the theory behind magic and the composition of spells, you are able to see magic in a different light and allows you to learn new or forgotten magic or even be able to use spells in a unique fashion. By seeing how a spell was created step by step, you can see the meaning behind each part of it and manipulate and alter it for your own purpose." He then gets up hands his wand to Remus and then says, "Allow me to offer you a demonstration, Princess, as it might give you an idea of what I mean."I hated the nickname princess and I can see he knows that. I was getting ready to retort because I hate it when someone beats me in an argument, but suddenly he casts a wandless shield charm. I cannot help but gape at him. That level of magic is advance. He is looking at me with an I win look and I cannot let him win. So, I say "That truly is advance magic Potter, but are you telling me you couldn't have learned it without Magical theory?" It turned more into a genuine question at the end.He seemed to sense this as his demeanor relaxed a bit and he replies "Like you said I probably could've, with enough time, but magical theory definitely helped. Magical theory isn't something that allows you to grasp every type of magic. All it does is it gives you the full picture. It focuses on the theory behind it, why certain movements, certain words produce specific types of magic. Without it, you can learn the what but you don't know the how or the why. For me in particular, by being able to see the full picture I can manipulate and slightly alter spells in a way that benefits my specific need. Another example, it teaches us that the wand is only used to focus your power, and how as children before we use our wands we all perform small acts of wandless magic. That the ability to use wandless magic is ingrained in us, it is just that we spend so much time training with a wand that we don't practice without a wand. Then, It's just a matter of practice and focus, and training to develop wandless magic. Don't you see what I am saying, it's about understanding because to solve problems you need to understand and look at all sides of the problem and that is why magical theory is important if you are able to focus and are willing to try and get past the boring beginning."The rest of the girls and I were all shocked, his speech was flawless and logical and it was difficult to find a fault in it. It was so full of passion, and willingness to get me and the rest to understand. It is a natural gift of Potter, when he talks about something important to him, he speaks with such passion, charisma, and understanding that you can't help but listen and agree with him. I hate that about him, it is annoying and he never uses it for anything important. However, if I am being honest with myself it is a bit awe-inspiring. Then, the other Marauders burst out laughing and Sirius says "prongs the amount of time I've heard you go on and on about that class is adding up, I could almost have your entire speech memorized, although I do believe I would do such a better job as I have such a melodic voice and a flair for dramatics which you seem to lack."This made the rest of us laugh."Oi, Padfoot, you may have me with your flair for the dramatics, but I certainly believe I have you beat for looks" Potter replies"Fat chance" Sirius retorts.Almost at the same moment they turn to Remus and Peter and asks "Moony, Wormtail, which one of us is better looking."Peter then loudly whispers to Remus "Not again, how many times have they had this argument in the past month 10, 20 times."Dorcas interjects "So you've had a quiet month."All of us laughed except Sirius and Potter they pouted.Potter and Sirius realizing they weren't going to get an answer decided instead to play duel with wands. We couldn't help but laugh when Sirius made his dramatic fake death as Potter finished him off.It was then I realized it was going to be a fun train ride. The remaining time was passed with us spending time as a group laughing and joking and soon enough we arrived at Hogsmeade station.Please if there is anyone actually reading this, this is my first fanfiction so it would be really helpful if you comment, and most importantly offer feedback so I can get better.

Sept 1st, 1976)Lily's POVWe just arrived at the train station and as a group, we get up and begin to exit the train. I head towards the carriage following Marlene and the rest of my friends. Before we can get there, we hear a small cough from behind us."We're going to catch a later carriage as we need to discuss and prepare a few things," Potter calls.I turn around to give a harsh reply, knowing they are up to no good, but it's too late and they are already gone. I turn back to my friends and ask "what do you think that was about?"Dorcas answers quickly "what do you think it's about Lily, they are obviously causing trouble or planning their first prank." I can't help but agree with her and see Marlene and the rest of them nodding in agreement."I can't help but wonder what it is? Marlene, did James happen to mention what they're up to?" Mary asksMarlene shakes her head disappointingly and says "No, they seemed to want to keep it a secret."You know the Marauders, they love to surprise people and probably think it will add to the showmanship," Dorcas adds."Whatever it is, it is going to be great, it always is. I think they are planning something special, I mean did you see the book James was reading." Alice says"Yeah I saw it, it is a complicated charms book, who knows what they are up to if it requires magic that complicated," I reply. In my head I hope it isn't that bad, the marauder's pranks are normally damaging and usually target the Slytherins. Most people find them funny, but I find most of them cruel, I mean not all of Slytherin house is bad. I was hoping over the summer, Remus might have been able to calm them down, but so far I am disappointed. As I am thinking of this, I hear my friends discussing what the marauders are going to do excitedly. I suddenly rush forward seeing an empty carriage. I climb in followed by Mary and the rest of my group. Before the carriage can pull away, three more faces climb into the carriage. Andy Reid, my fellow 6th-year prefect, Sammy Violetta, a 6th year, a muggle-born, she is quiet and nice and I know she has a crush on Sirius black, finally, Liz Khanna a 6th year Ravenclaw, who is also shy. She often studies with Remus in the library when I am not there. Remus said she is really smart and helpful. I smile at them and say "hello."They all reply with various "hello's" and "hi's" and take a seat opposite from us. They begin their own conversation talking about who they think is going to be the new DADA teacher. I turn to my friends and join in the conversation they were having."Did you hear the new song by the Hobgoblins?" Mary asks"They are such a great band, and I can't help but be envious of their talent." Dorcas answers"Come on Dorcas, your voice is amazing, everyone looks forward to you and James performing after Quidditch matches." Marlene saysWe all nod fervently and Dorcas bursts into laughter at our faces. She says "I wasn't fishing for compliments you guys but thanks anyways.""I would like to add that Queen is superior to the Hobgoblins, it is not even a contest" I addThe others collectively roll their eyes until we hear a new voice enter the conversation "Lily's right, Queens superior to the Hobgoblins in every way."Lily turns and sees Andy Reid looking over with Sammy Violetta whose nodding her head. I turn back to her friends and smiles smugly."Their music may be better, but come on, have you seen Stebbins Boardman he is far more attractive than anyone in Queen." Marlene begins to argue.Scoffing can be heard from Sammy who says "Have you seen Freddie Mercury, he blows Stebbins Boardman completely out of the water. He has perfected the bad boy look."Interested, I turn to Sammy, "are you a big fan of Music?"Sammy smiles and answers "yeah, I'm hoping to have a career in music after school. I'm taking both Muggle Music and Music NEWTs this year. Gryffindor is not the only house with musical performances at their parties.""Are you any good? What's your genre? Who's in your band?" I ask really quickly. Behind me I see my friends snickering and rolling their eyes. They know I get over-excited sometimes.Sammy who does not seem to be phased by my energy answers "Andy Reid over here is the drummer, Kylar Hicks, and Mandy Macheda play the guitar, and I am the singer. We play rock music and we are decent, but we can definitely improve." At the mention that she was a singer, Dorcas's interest peeked and they began a really complicated conversation about singing. I look over at Andy and smile and say "I will definitely have to hear you guys play." In my head, I am thinking we might have made some new friends. The conversation of music continues all the way to the castle.Timeskip to arriving at the castleOur carriage arrives at the front doors and I smile excited to be back and enjoying the view of the large oak doors. My friends and I enter the castle and see the usual corridors stretched out in front of us. We begin to head towards the great hall and find our seats for the feast. We're some of the first to arrive. We begin to talk about who the new DADA teacher will be."It won't matter who he is, he will be gone by the end of the year. We all know the job is jinxed." Dorcas says"Dorcas you and I know it is an important year, we need to have a good DADA teacher if we are going to have any chance at doing well in NEWTs," Alice says"Alice is right, we can't have a useless teacher as we did back in the second year. We learned absolutely nothing that year." I add."I'm not even taking DADA, I didn't pass the OWL. So I don't really care who the new teacher is. I'm more concerned with who the new ancient studies and ancient runes teacher will be." Mary saysI look over expecting Marlene to add something, but I notice she is staring at the entrance to the Great Hall."This can't be good," I say to the rest of my friends, pointing to the entrance of the Great Hall.James POVAfter exiting the train and getting away from the girls, we immediately begin to discuss everyone's role in the upcoming prank."So Padfoot, you're in charge of the projections right, Wormtail, you're in charge of the sounds, and Remus, you're in charge of helping me break the enchantments right," I say while my friends all roll their eyes.Padfoot grins and says "Sir yes Sir, Commander Prongs"Wormtail adds "Roger" (giving James a salute)Remus smiles and says "I read the same book you did Prongs, stop worrying, it is going to go perfectly.""That's lord and supreme master to you, Padfoot. Please try and use my proper title when addressing me." I say, pretending to give him a stern look.We all burst into laughter as we all head towards an empty carriage at the back of the procession. As we are getting in, two people join our carriage. First, is Lucinda Talkalot, the person who is supposed to be the Slytherin quidditch captain and seventh year Slytherin Garrett Beck who is a nice enough, hard-working, and honest guy. I smile at Lucinda and say "Hey Lucinda, did you get the Slytherin Quidditch Captaincy? Hey Garrett."Garrett inclines his head and Lucinda smiles and says "Yeah, I did, I'm so excited I can't wait to get started. I have so many ideas." I look over and see Moony and Padfoot deep in conversation with Garrett about what I think is classes. I turn back to Lucinda and reply "It will be a good competition this year, every team seems to be strong. I mean besides Ravenclaw, who has that idiot in charge Worton Davis.""I know if Hestia wasn't head girl. She's a better leader and player. Hufflepuff is looking pretty dangerous though under Edgar Bones." Lucinda answers"I always say Gryffindor is the best, but this year there is definitely some strong competition. Edgar Bones isn't the one on Hufflepuff who scares me. Remember last year the fourth year, Tim Stephenson, he was always good but it seems like they finally found him some decent chasers to support him, he looks like he's going to be a star." I say enthusiastically"I remember that kid, made the team in the third year, some sort of prodigy. I like to think Slytherin is the top threat to, but this year between you and Hufflepuff it's going to be one hell of a first season as Captain." Lucinda babbles"I think you are forgetting that you have the most skilled seeker in the school, don't tell Dorcas I said that, and there is you, who is the best keeper in the school. Although I still believe that Wood will be a star one day." I say"That's true but you are also forgetting I have to deal with three idiots, Mulciber, Avery, and Wilkes, who we both know won't show me any respect. They will think because I am a woman and because I am not all for that Pureblood shit, that they won't have to listen." Lucinda says while frowning."That's true but don't you have the fourth year kid, Ralph Hammerton. Isn't he a good chap?" I ask"Yes, he definitely is, but I am worried if the wrong people influence him I could lose him." She says, looking rather sad."You've got this Lucinda, we have been playing against each other for how many years 7! 8! Even though we've never been friends, we have been playing against each other before Hogwarts. You were always an amazing person to play against and you always pushed me to be better. Through those years, I've learned your determined, strong, and a very good strategist. You were selected as captain for a reason and because Slughorn clearly trusts you to lead. We all know you can lead. So, lead them don't give them a choice." I rantShe looks at me surprised "I didn't know you were such an admirer of me or any Slytherin for that matter""As I said before, we're not friends, but I've played against you for years, I've come to garner a certain level of respect for you. Plus, I know it is difficult being the captain. The stress piles up. Last year was my first year and I was terrified in the beginning. I even snapped at people unfairly and I had some rather loud outbursts. That's with my teammates being less fickle than your teammates so you've got it even harder." I answer shrugging.She smiles and we continue chatting until the carriage reaches the castle, with Padfoot, Moony, Garrett, and Wormtail occasionally chiming in.Timeskip to arriving at the castleAs the Carriage reaches the Castle we can tell we are one of the last ones there just like we planned. Lucinda and Garrett quickly hop out, wave a quick goodbye, and headed into the castle. We took a little longer, as we got out we couldn't help but admire the Castle and the grounds. Padfoot smiles and says "Are we ready boys." We all laugh answering with various "Yes and Of course's." We pass through the Oak front doors and see people hurrying to the great hall. We follow until we reach the entrance to the great hall. Moony and Padfoot who were leading us suddenly stop. I bump into Padfoot and say "what's wrong Padfoot?" I don't receive an answer so I push my way to the front and see a group of Slytherins standing in front of us. I examine each face individually. First, I see Mulciber with his beady chocolate-colored eyes, and his thick, straight, yellow hair is worn in a style that reminds you of a trailing ribbon and his skin is deeply-tanned. He is sadistic and loves hurting people, with his best friend Avery, the second face I see. Avery has slitted brown eyes. He has fine, curly, midnight black hair that is worn in a style that reminds you of a fluttering flag. He's got a small beard and a stylish mustache. He is tall and has a lithe build. His skin is pale. Next are Crabbe and Goyle, two mindless gits who are dumb as they are heavy. They are tall, with dark eyes and pale skin. They are huge. The last two, Severus Snape and Wilkes. Wilkes is a smart, ambitious, power-hungry, manipulative asshole, who gets away with everything thanks to his proud and rich pureblood family. He has slitted green eyes that are like two chunks of jade. His fine, straight, white hair is very short and is worn in an elegant style. He is very short and has a big build. His skin is white. He has hollow cheeks. Finally, Severus Snape my rival, my enemy, is an ambitious, dark art obsessed, and unfortunately intelligent git. He is round-shouldered yet angular and has a twitchy walk that recalls a spider, as well as having long oily hair that jumps about his face. All I can think is this is not good. I need to get through this without a duel. I need to protect my friends, from these snakes, who clearly wants to hurt them. I glare at Mulciber who is in the lead and then say "Mulciber, Avery, and the rest of you snakes, what did we do to warrant such a reward as to have you waiting patiently for us to arrive. Padfoot did we forget to do something?"Padfoot smiles and says "No, I don't think we did but we can give them a hex or two in case we forgot."I grin to myself, we are always great in these situations. We know exactly how to piss them off. I reply "I think I remember now, we were supposed to visit their compartment and say hi, how could we have forgotten?"Padfoot answers with a wide grin "Prongs your forgetting we do not like them and we go out of our way to avoid them."I turn to them and knowing it will make things worse, but I cannot help myself. I say "Okay, we're sorry for not saying hello, it is just when we see you our days instantly worsens. Now if you don't mind we're just going to step past you and take our seats."They didn't move their snarling faces getting bigger. I am starting to get a little concerned. I look around for a helpful teacher maybe McGonagall, head of our house. Instead, I see that many people in the great hall had their heads turned in our directions. I see Marlene and lock eyes with her. She seems to be asking if we need any help. I quickly shack my head, this was our problem and I didn't want her getting hurt by getting involved. No one hurts Marlene on my watch. Even worse, she might bring Lily and Mary into this who are both muggle-born, and they would be in much more danger than us. I turn to the rest back to my friends."It seems that us failing to greet them isn't what we did wrong. Do you have any ideas about why they are mad?" I sayWormtail says "they might have discovered a spell to swap their bodies with ours, as it's the only thing that can make them look remotely decent."This time Mulciber replies raising his wand "Right as if we would ever want to look like an ugly peasant like yourself."Padfoot and I both draw are wands, I am furious that he would try and hex Wormtail for a simple insult. Together we say "Don't you dare."Moony then dangerously calm says "Put your wand away Mulciber, some of your friends may be stupid enough *looking at Crabbe and Goyle* but you certainly aren't stupid enough to try and hex us with all these witnesses. You would clearly be at fault and would end up the worse for wear."Mulciber slowly lowers his wand but then snarls "This is a warning, stay out of our way this year or else we will hurt you and every single one of your friends. He is getting stronger outside, his influence is growing and with our parent's influence, we can't be expelled. We are unstoppable, our numbers are growing, you don't have the numbers to stand up to us. So just stay out of our way."I full-on glare at Mulciber and then say very loudly "Don't forget who you are talking to. We are the Marauders, and we're not scared of anyone. So if you continue to use dark magic and hurting muggle-borns, than we will get in your way every single time. Trust me, you don't want to fuck with the marauders. We may not be able to get you expelled but we can put you in the hospital wing for the rest of your time at Hogwarts. If you think about ambushing or attacking us remember, who you are dealing with. Your dealing with the students who get top grades in their year, the students who have pulled off numerous impossible pranks, several pranks that have humiliated you and your entire house, and the group of students that know the school better than the back of their hands. So, if a situation arises where you think you have us cornered, then really you don't. We're there because we want to be there and we want to be ambushed. We won't be the ones coming off worse." When I finish, with all the students' eyes on us, we push past the Slytherins, I make sure to ram Mulciber with my shoulder and we head towards the Gryffindor table. I make sure to show no fear on my face, but I can't help but be terrified for my friends. Mulciber seemed serious about hurting every single one of our friends. That could include the girls. We can only protect so many people. This just got a whole lot more complicated. We take our rightful seats next to the girls, who look shocked, impressed, and in Lily's case disapproval. I roll my eyes and look at my friends. Moony is calm but has a fierce look in his eyes. Padfoot doesn't seem to be bothered by the interaction. Wormtail however, looks absolutely terrified. I whisper to them "the sorting is going to start soon we better get ready." Just then Minnie or Professor McGonagall walks in with a stream of terrified first years.I look at Padfoot and say "aren't those the two first years we helped out on the train pointing to the two familiar-looking girls."Sirius smiles and says "I think it is."It is time for our prank so I look over a Moony and hold up my fingers 3, 2, 1. Moony and I begin to mutter spells working on breaking the enchantments that creates the magical sky above the great hall. When we've broken it, we've got to continue the spells otherwise we think the enchantments will return. Padfoot then begins the projections right as the sorting hat begins his song. The hat begins"I've done this job for centuries, the sorted student's into houses based on their head, I take in their various skills and talents, for I am the famous sorting hat.The story begins long ago when four great wizards had the idea to come together and teach young wizards how to use their magic.They were best of friends, as there was no one closer than Gryffindor and Slytherin, except maybe the other two Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw.Not long after the school opens, differences arise. Gryffindor wants to teach only the brave of heart. Ravenclaw wants to teach only those who are wise and sharp of mind. Slytherin wanted to only teach those pure of blood. Hufflepuff said she would teach all of them and treat them all the same.Soon after an argument between Gryffindor and Slytherin resulted in Slytherin fleeing the castle. Gryffindor decided to take his hat off his head and give it the power to sort students long after they were gone.I've sorted the great, I've sorted the weak and everything in between, so put me on and I will tell you, which house you should be in.You may be in Gryffindor where the brave of heart dwell, you show daring, nerve, and chivalry which sets you apart from the rest.You might be in Hufflepuff, where the loyal and honest reside, those in Hufflepuffs are true at heart and unafraid of turmoil.You might be in Ravenclaw if you have an intelligent mind, those in Ravenclaw being sharp of wit and understanding, always willing to learn.Or You might be in Slytherin, if you have a cunning mind, those in Slytherins, are ambitious and make real friends, who always achieve their ends."With every line the hat sang, Padfoot would conjure images to match them. I spared a quick look around and everyone was transfixed by it. As the song finished, four creatures appeared in the sky. A lion, a badger, a snake, and an eagle.Professor McGonagall then called up the first name "Abbott, Damian"A young boy with cocoa skin, auburn hair, and brown eyes walks up to the hat rather calmly.The hat deliberates for a few seconds before calling out "Hufflepuff" and shock begins around the great hall as the sound of a badger reverberates around the hall from the mouth of the badger apparition. The sorting continues with each time a house is decided, the animal apparition of each house would make its signature call. As the sorting finishes, McGonagall walks over to us and tells us "detention boys tomorrow my office right after dinner."Dumbledore then walks up to his podium and says "Welcome back everyone to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. I know you must be all hungry from the long train ride and sorting, so without further ado dig in."Lily's POVThe plates in front of us change to reveal a delicious feast, with every type of food anyone could want. I begin to fill up my plate and listen to the conversations around me."That was such an amazing prank guys, how do you come up with these ideas?" Mary asks"It was all Moony's idea this time." Sirius says while Potter pats his back affectionately."Did you guys plan that on the train?" Dorcas asks"Course, it doesn't take that long. Besides, we are naturally gifted and amazing" Sirius says.I can't help but laugh neither can the girls. The confidence these boys have is amazing. This is the type of prank I don't actually mind. It didn't hurt anyone and the magic was rather impressive. I turn to Potter who seems to still be muttering, confused I look at Remus questioningly."We are muttering the counter spell to the spell we used in case it didn't completely wear off." Remus explains."How did you know how to do that?" I ask rather curiously because it seems very surprising that four sixth years can do such a thing.Remus laughs and says "Remember the book James was reading on the train, well in the book there was a spell that paired along with a couple of spells would fit our need. However, it took both James and I working together and keeping the spells going throughout the whole sorting."I can't help but smile and start to wonder just how much the four of them prepare for their pranks and how much they learn from their pranks. Shaking my head to clear my thoughts I say "You really have dedication, bravo."Potter stops muttering and then turns to Marlene and Dorcas, "Guess who the new Slytherin and Hufflepuff Quidditch captains are!"They both look at him expectantly and he says "Lucinda Talkalot and Edgar Bones." I know Edgar through Thomas and can't help but think he'll be a great captain."So we've got some competition." Dorcas saysAnd the three of them begin a long conversation about Quidditch, Peter, and Sirius seem to be talking about the food. I turn to Mary and begin to talk about her latest drawings.Timeskip to Dumbledore's SpeechDumbledore steps up to the Podium,"I would like to make a few announcements before you go and have your well-deserved rest. First of all, the school will have a group of Aurors surrounding the castle for everyone's protection. Second, the new DADA professor will be Beverly Wyatt."She was a small woman standing at about 5' 0" tall, she has pale skin and has an angry feel about her. She has a round face with a cleft chin, a large nose, small ears, and thin lips. Her brown eyes are narrow, and she has neat eyebrows. She has shoulder-length, wavy, mousey brown hair which is swept back. She wears light eyeliner, foundation, dark lipstick, and natural-colored blush. She has strong arms, a strong torso with a narrow waist, and toned legs. She stands and gives a small wave as most of the students including me applaud."The new ancient runes and ancient studies professor is professor Bathsheba Babbling."She is average height about 5' 4" tall, she has orange skin and has a determined feel about her. She has a square face, a well-formed nose, and very thin lips. Her green eyes are round and she has thick eyebrows. She has blonde hair. She wears natural-colored blush, natural-colored lipstick, garish eyeliner, glittery eyeshadow, and a slightly off-colored foundation. She has long arms, a lean torso with no muscle tone, and weak legs. She offers the students a wide grin and smiles. Mary is clapping particularly loud."Third, the Forbidden Forest is out of bounds to all students." He says that last part well looking at the marauders. Who all have wide grins on their faces. The audacity, however, looking at Dumbledore he has a twinkle in his eyes."Lastly, this school will be hosting a very special event this year. This year Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament." There is muttering starting up, I myself am thinking back to what I read about the Triwizard tournament. It is a tournament that has resulted in so many deaths. I can't believe Dumbledore would risk bringing it back.I listen again as Dumbledore continues "I will explain the Triwizard Tournament to those of you who don't know what it is and for those of you who do know about it, please be patient. The Triwizard Tournament was established seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools, Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. They used to happen every five years and established connections between wizards of different nationalities. That was until the danger became too great and so the tournament was discontinued. We will be bringing it back this year, and the heads of our department of international magic co-operation and magical games and sports have worked tirelessly to protect the champions. The other schools will be here at Halloween and the champions will be selected then.It will definitely be interesting to meet the other schools. Since I have never actually met a wizard my age who doesn't attend Hogwarts. He continues "An impartial judge will choose the champions and the winner of the tournament will get a thousand galleon personal prize money and the glory of winning the tournament. This year any student who is 15 or younger will not be allowed, because we feel that it will increase the overall safety of the champions. This is because it is highly unlikely anyone below sixth or seventh year will be able to cope with the challenges. I will personally be ensuring that no one hoodwinks the impartial judge."His eyes flitting to some of the younger students. I can't help but roll my eyes and think that this is stupid, age restrictions won't protect anyone. He continues "The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be staying with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give all your support to the Hogwarts champion. Now it is late, and I know sleep is important, off to bed now." He finishes.I get up and shout to the first years to follow me along with Remus and we make our way towards the Gryffindor common room.So, like the first chapter, if anyone is actually reading this, it is my first fanfiction, so I could really use your feedback, and please comment.

(Sept 1st, 1976)James POVI am stunned, the Triwizard Tournament, I never thought it would come back. I have read about them, the Tournaments are legendary. The tasks are always entertaining and the champions get to perform magic that no one else ever gets to try. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I can't help but wonder if I should enter. I mean when else will I get the chance to do something like this. As someone who likes adventure and not passing up opportunities, I am not sure if I can pass this up. I am good at magic, I think quickly, I love competition and I can put on a show. I think I would win or at least be a worthy champion. My thoughts wander to the other schools, I wonder what they will be like. Will they have a different education than us? Will the students be friendly or stuck up? Does Durmstrang really teach the Dark arts? Suddenly, I feel a sharp pain in my ribs, and I am ripped away from my daydreams. I look up and see Marlene standing along with the rest of the students, looking at me confused. I realize Dumbledore's speech must be over, and it's time to head to our common room. I get up and make to follow Marlene and the others. Marlene walks a little slower than everyone else, falling into step with me.She asks a little worriedly "Are you okay, you seemed to be lost in thought back there?"I smile hopefully in a reassuring fashion and reply "Course I am, just thinking about the Triwizard Tournament."Marlene who has always been able to read me like a book gives me a look like she knows exactly what I am thinking."What about the Triwizard Tournament?" She asks cautiously. I know I am screwed, I have never been able to lie to her. I wasn't planning on telling anyone that I might enter the Triwizard Tournament. I wanted to first make the decision for myself, rather than having the input of a hundred different people. I wanted it to be my decision, no one else. But this is Marlene, I tell her everything, so I should tell her."Well, it is a unique opportunity to perform magic that otherwise, you wouldn't be allowed to perform. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have a unique experience don't you think." I say slowly, considering it best to go slow."You're right, it would be a unique opportunity and it might be lots of fun but it also might not be. Either way, it will take a lot of studying won't it?" Marlene asks, in a way that suggests she thinks it is not worth all the work because there is no promise of fun."Depends who you are and how much you know but I see your point. Who do you think will enter?" I askShe stays silent for a few minutes before answering "From Ravenclaw, Worton Davis, he'll do anything for a little glory. Pandora probably as well, she will see it as a unique opportunity. From Hufflepuff, Alex Traore, like Worton he is trying to make a name for himself. Ruby Field will enter as well, smart girl, she would be a good champion. From Slytherin, Alexander Webb, he's a good option, ambitious, clever but he is rather temperamental. Elizabeth Ekholm also, she loves the attention and wants to be popular. Finally, from Gryffindor Shirley Bell, who is a badass and very athletic and smart. Of course, there will also be you, who screams champion but still."I stare surprised that she said it so quickly but reply anyways "You already figured it out, not surprising, you know me. Can I ask your honest opinion?"She pauses weighing her words with care and then replies "I think, you know the dangers involved, but you also know what kind of opportunity this is. I think you are smart, daring, bold, and are strong enough to be a worthy threat in the tournament. I think if you enter, you'll be one of the few in it for the experience instead of the money and glory, which will make you an even better candidate. I think because I know you as I do, if you put your name in the Goblet of fire you will be chosen."I nod grateful that she didn't say whether I should or shouldn't enter. "I am still making up my mind, nothing is definite yet. I still want to read a little more about the tournament before I make up my mind."She smiles and says "As long as your sure, I will have your back. But when you do make up your mind you will let me know right?"I nod and say "Of course you will be the first to know. Do you mind not sharing this with the others? I want to think about it without the others forcing their opinions on me.""Of course, no problem." She says. We walk the remaining distance in silence, both lost in our own thoughts. We reach the portrait of the fat lady who guards the entrance to the Gryffindor Common Room. I quickly realize I never asked Moony what the password was. I look over at Marlene hopefully and relax. She looks calm, clearly, she knows the password."Eques," She says and the fat lady smiles and the portrait swings open revealing the Gryffindor common room. I see the familiar room, full of squashy armchairs, tables, and a bulletin board. There are bookcases with various novels and stories. Everything decorated with different shades of red. The walls are decorated with scarlet tapestries that depict various important people and animals.There is a large fireplace with a roaring fire already going. The mantle of the fireplace has a portrait of a lion. The fireplace is connected to the Floo Network but it is extremely public except at night. I see all of our friends sitting in the best armchairs by the fire. We walk over, I take the seat in between Alice and Padfoot, while Marlene walks over and sits next to Lily.Lily's POVAfter leading the first years through the corridors and to Gryffindor tower, Remus and I go over the rules and explain how they get into the Gryffindor common room. We reach the portrait of the fat lady."Eques," I say, it is the Latin word for knight and the password to get into the Gryffindor common room."Boys dormitory is to the left, Girls dormitory to the right. Look for the door with the number 1 on it. Boys aren't allowed up the girls' staircase, there are enchantments placed on it. I explain calmly.A young boy with brown hair and blue eyes asks very confusedly "What happens if a boy tries to go up the girls' staircase."Remus answers "Eric, it will just turn into a slide and prevent you from walking up the stairs, nothing else.Eric smiles gratefully at Remus, looking interested, and says "thank you, sir."I can tell Remus is surprised by the sir but also pleased. I roll my eyes and say with authority"Okay, Boys follow Remus he will take you to your dorms, Girls follow me."I take the little first-year girls upstairs and show them their room. As they enter they all gasp in surprise and look around amazed. One of the girls, a girl who is tiny with fair skin, grey hair, and brown eyes asks shocked "Is this all for us?"I smile down at her as the rest of the girls head in and say "Yes it is just for you guys, now why don't you go in and make some friends with your dormmates. She smiles happily and heads in leaving me alone in the staircase. I turn around and head back down the stairs. I see everyone but Marlene and Potter sitting in the nice armchairs by the fire. They seem to be talking about the incident with the Slytherins. I take an empty seat and listen to Sirius tell the story."So we were just walking to the great hall, completely innocent and minding our own business." Dorcas snorts, obviously thinking that the Marauders are never innocent.He continues "When we reached the doors to the great hall, we found our way blocked by Mulciber, Avery, Goyle, Crabbe, Sniv Sniv, and Wilkes." Seriously still, I can't believe they call Severus by the stupid nickname they made in the first year."James made a joke obviously to get a reaction hoping that they would move but alas no such luck. After some playful banter, Mulciber raised his wand to hex Peter and that is when things turned serious." Sirius says, that's no surprise I think to myself, Mulciber enjoys hurting people so it's not surprising that he tried to hex Peter."Remus playing peacemaker convinced Mulciber to lower his wand. But then Mulciber made a big speech about how Voldemort *Cue collective shudder* is growing stronger outside, and how their numbers are growing inside the castle. He also said that if we don't stay out of their way, they will hurt us." Sirius finishes rolling his eyes. It's surprising that he can act so calmly about a death threat. But I notice the story doesn't feel finished. I have a bad feeling about what happened next.Mary who seems to sense the same thing I did. She asks "Is that all? How'd you respond to the threat?"Sirius pauses as if considering how much to say. He then says "Well, James took care of that. He responded to the threat, with his own threat, warning him of the danger of getting on the bad side of the marauders. He pretty much told them to take their best shot, because we will be ready and that if they do attack us, they will come off much worse."I am shocked. How the fuck could Potter have been so stupid, threatening the future death eaters, telling them to take their best shot at the marauders, does he want to be hurt. Looking at Dorcas and Mary they seem just as surprised although slightly less worried. I look over at Alice and she looks rather calm almost like she expected it to happen.She then says "That is not surprising, I mean that is exactly what he would say.""True, plus if they were threatening you, if I was being threatened I would probably do the same," Dorcas says"If you guys are prepared then I don't think it was that bad." Mary saysI'm furious, how can they support such an idiotic decision. I mean are they crazy. They are already in danger and they are just asking for more. Taunting the future death eaters will only anger them and it will cause them to act worse. Why can't everyone play nice?"Are you guys kidding, why the fuck would you guys threaten them, it will only make things worse. Besides, Potter literally welcomed an attack, do you guys like getting hurt or something? Remus, I thought you were smarter than that, and that you had better control over your mates!" I splutter with my temper rising"I thought you were smarter than that Princess, but clearly you are an idiot." I turn and see Potter sitting between Alice and Sirius, while Marlene sits next to me."Are you fucking kidding me, please explain to me how the fuck you think that threatening future death eaters was a good idea!" I shout, my temper reaching its peak, no one and I mean no one calls me stupid, especially not when they are being an idiot.Potter looks calmly at Sirius and Remus as if to say do you want to take this one. After a few seconds of silent arguing, Remus speaks up completely calm."Lily, you know that they are going to attack students, specifically muggle-borns right?" I nod my head wondering where this is going."Now if we didn't make the threat, who would they have focused their efforts on?" Remus continues. How am I suppose to know this, how is anyone suppose to know this? Is he pulling my leg or something? Why would their threat change things? I suddenly hear an intake of breath and see understanding on Dorcas's face. With my temper already on high alert I can't help but scream internally, what am I not getting."I don't know, what do you expect me to do, read their minds?" I say sarcastically.Sirius replies evenly "No, that is the whole idea, anyone could have been the target of their worst ideas." What, why'd they ask the question then, I'm seriously confused with what is going on. Are they stalling or pulling my leg? I look over and see Alice and Marlene both have comprehension written on their faces. I look over and see Mary just as confused as I am and I relax a bit because I hate it when I am the last one to get something."Then, what's the point," I ask much calmer this time."Well, you see their prime target used to be unknown, but don't you see after our threat the main target is us. By threatening them and asking them to do their worst, and calling them out in front of an audience, leaves them no choice but to go after us" Sirius answers with a small smile on his face.Holy fuck, I say to myself, I finally understand what they are saying, but still what they did was incredibly risky and will get them hurt. Do they have a death wish or something? How could Potter, the leader, let them do such a thing. Does he not care about his friends' suffering or something? Why would they want to be the targets?"Isn't it a little dangerous making yourselves the main targets? Aren't you afraid one of you is going to get hurt? Why are you so desperate to be attacked? Do you need excitement or something?" I ask"Your highness, we know it is completely dangerous making ourselves the main targets and we know there's a risk of one of us being hurt. But trust us, we are much and I mean much more equipped to deal with dangerous situations than you think. We've been dealing with it for years. Besides, if their attention wasn't focused on us they would be focusing on poor innocent muggle-born students who could be seriously hurt. Worse, out of fear, their numbers would grow astronomically. By standing up to them, we protect innocent muggle-borns and show that there are people willing to stand up against the future death eaters and to lower the general fear. If one of us gets hurt in the process then it is worth it." Potter proclaimsSirius, Remus, and Peter nodding their heads in unison. Marlene, Dorcas, and Alice all seemed to have understood that from the very beginning as they offer smiles to the Marauders. Mary has an inquisitive look on her face. I wonder what she is thinking. I mean she got attacked last year, so I think she is probably happy that there is someone out there who is going to publicly defend muggle-borns with wands drawn. I may not be for this whole plan as it's dangerous, stupid, impulsive, risky, and makes them all seem expendable, but I can't help but admire them, they have always been brave, and what they did was a true Gryffindor move."I remember every second of being attacked," Mary suddenly begins "I have nightmares every week about being attacked by Mulciber and Avery."She pauses as if she is trying to clear her head. I feel horrible and proud that she is sharing this, I remember when she first told us, she couldn't stop crying and she was in the hospital wing for weeks. She continues slowly "When I walk through the halls I am constantly looking over my shoulder, worried that I am going to be attacked. I wake up struggling to breathe, my body writhing with the imaginary pain, having to go through the same attack over and over again. So, the idea that you guys are willing to help muggle-borns and protect them from future attacks is honestly amazing of you guys." As she finishes, she smiles at each of the marauders.I smile inwardly, it is great that she is able to talk about this, although what she says still worries me, she said she was getting better but what she says doesn't match that. I will have to talk to her later this week and keep a close eye on her to make sure she is okay."That's why we're doing this Lily, there will be more stories like hers if we don't do something. You don't need to worry about us, we are more prepared than you think. Dealing with future death eaters isn't the most dangerous thing we do so don't worry about it." Potter whispers.I'm surprised by this, Potter never uses my real name unless he's serious, I look over to reply but Sirius is already engaging him in a conversation. I can't help but replay what he says, what could he do that's more dangerous than being attacked. Also, what did he mean about being more prepared than I know? What could he have that I don't know. Suddenly, a voice breaks me from my thoughts."So, the Triwizard Tournament, what's your opinion on it?" Dorcas asks.I knew we would reach this topic at some point, I wonder what is everyone's opinion on it. I am certainly against it, but I'm interested in hearing what the others think."I am all for it, I think it will be interesting to see the champions perform the different tasks. Although, I would never enter, too much pressure." Mary says"I'm with Mary, it will be so cool to watch. If there wasn't so much studying involved, I would enter." Sirius answers"I don't know, it sounds dangerous," Alice says, Thank god there is someone else who agrees with me. "But I think having the chance to meet the other wizarding schools is fascinating." Alice continues."Yeah, I mean they could know magic that we have never learned at Hogwarts. We can meet new friends, find out the differences between our schools. These connections could be useful down the road when we are looking for a job." Remus adds."I don't know about the new schools, isn't Durmstrang the school that teaches its students the dark arts. Isn't it where Grindlewald came from. Peter says while shivering."I am sure they aren't that bad Peter, or the school wouldn't have remained open all these years. You can't judge a school by one student." I say, hopefully reassuringly. I definitely want to meet the members of the new schools, as it will be a chance to learn more about the magical world outside of Britain."Plus, Peter think, there will be new foods most likely from their home countries made in order to make them feel more at home." Dorcas smiles at him and he smiles back."Think of all the parties that will be thrown if the champion is a Gryffindor. There will be one the night they are chosen, one after each task. That's at least four huge ones." Marlene squeals excitedly, sending a pointed look in Potter's direction. Why is she looking at Potter, he's probably the one responsible for throwing the parties. That has to be right, he wouldn't be impulsive enough to enter. Would he?"I forgot about that good call Marlene, we better hope it is a Gryffindor then, because I certainly want four days of drinking, partying, and just having a good time." Sirius says.I decide it's time for me to raise my concerns so I say "Isn't it a little dangerous? I mean it was canceled because the death toll was too high. They shouldn't be bringing it back.""Didn't you hear Dumbledore, they are adding extra precautions this year designed to protect the champions. I'm sure it will be a lot safer." Dorcas replies.I can't help but roll my eyes, all we've heard so far is that there is an age limit in place. "That doesn't mean it's going to be safe, the only change we've heard so far is the addition of an age limit. Besides, who would want to enter, its knowingly putting yourself in danger." I say"There are very many reasons for someone to enter the tournament. There is the prize money for one thing. Second, there is the glory of winning the tournament which not only is a great accomplishment to have, it will also instantly make whoever wins extremely popular in and outside of Hogwarts." Potter explainsMoney and Glory sounds like a great exchange for risking my life, and in the end, there is no guarantee. Who would be egotistical enough to do such a thing I think to myself. "So you are saying only desperate people and people who are arrogant and self-centered will enter the tournament?" I scoffPotter who is clearly getting frustrated says "I said there are very many reasons for someone to enter the Triwizard tournament, and I gave two examples. If you want more than you are going to have to shut up for more than 30 seconds princess." He pauses as if he's waiting for me to interrupt him, the arrogant prat don't rise, don't rise to his taunt, don't rise. He then continues "the main reason I think is the fact that this tournament is unique, a once in a lifetime opportunity. Think about it, when else would a champion get to fight a dragon, or deal with various magical plants, or learn and use spells in such a special way. For someone who loves adventure, loves to learn, and who never likes to pass up an opportunity would be greatly interested in participating in the Triwizard tournament." He finishes.I think on this, Potter seemed to have just described himself as the perfect candidate. He is someone who loves to learn, loves adventure, doesn't like to pass up an opportunity and he has already shown tonight that he isn't afraid of a little danger. He is definitely considering entering the tournament. Looking at Marlene, she definitely knows, Potter probably told her, the marauders along with Alice also look like they understood what Potter was implying. I can't believe he would be stupid and impulsive enough to consider such a thing. I know how to prove it though, I just have to get him mad."Even with that third reason, anyone who enters the Triwizard tournament is an arrogant, narcissistic, vain, adrenaline junkie. If they get hurt and die it is their own fault, and I don't think I would feel too bad about it." I say disgustedly, exaggerating my true feelings in order to get Potter to admit he is entering. I look at him and see I may have gone too far, and I am starting to regret my word choice."Hey Padfoot, I think that's the closest Princess has ever come to complimenting me, don't you think." He says with a fake grin on his face."Well, I think that's cause she didn't know you were entering otherwise she would have been much harsher Prongs," Sirius says laughing. I am shocked, he admitted to participating in the Triwizard Tournament, but the marauders weren't surprised or mad, it's like they expected it.Alice, on the other hand, seems hurt and says with her big round eyes "James, you are actually considering entering, it is a dangerous tournament, you could get hurt." Yes, go Alice help me convince him it is a bad idea.Dorcas adds "Are you sure about it? I'm not going to tell you if it is a good or bad idea, I just want to make sure you are going to think it through properly." That's kinda helpful but not really what you should be doing Dorcas. Convince him not to do something so stupid, come on, be your blunt self."I am going to think about it very carefully, I know there are risks involved. But like I said before, sometimes the opportunity outweighs the risks. And my conclusion might be that in this case, it is true." He answers sincerely.I start to prepare myself for an argument, it is better to say it while he is still deciding and deal with the consequences later. "Potter, we both know you already take enough risks, how about this time you deflate your head and chose the safe option just this once." I pleadHis face hardens slightly and says "This has nothing to do with glory or money, I think that the chance to use and learn new magic in this tournament may be too great to pass up. This is a chance to grow, to improve my reactions and my problem-solving skills. Just because you don't see the value in something doesn't mean it's useless. Like for fucksakes, not everyone has to agree with you Princess, maybe if you got off your high horse and remove the stick from up your ass, you would learn that not everyone has to agree with you." Wait wait wait, he did not just say that to me. No fucking way, I am not on a high horse, just because I am trying to change his mind about entering a dangerous tournament does not mean I am stuck up or have to be right. I just am right in this situation. There's no reason he should be risking his life in this tournament.Before I can make any sort of reply, He continues "I didn't even want to tell all of you, because I wanted it to be my own decision, but you goaded me into telling you. Why can't you be a little like the rest of them? Alice raised her concerns but didn't press me, neither did Dorcas. The marauders and Marlene will support any decision I make, but no you have to attack me like I am some sort of criminal."Oh so just because the rest of the group is too scared, to tell the truth, that you being an idiot I am the bad guy. Well, you know what I am not going to stand for this.*Picture the rest of the common room's eyes flicking back and forth like at a tennis match*I shout"Shut the fuck up Potter, just because I am the only member of this group, not scared to tell you the truth does not make me the bad one. Right now you and your big head and ego are being such a fucking asshole and causing you to think like an idiot."I can see him getting angrier, good. I continue "The Triwizard Tournament is an unnecessary risk, that will only cause your friends, not me, unnecessary worry. You are being your usual selfish prat by entering this tournament thinking about no one but yourself. I wonder why anyone is even friends with you."I may have gone too far but he deserved it."Lily" Marlene says softly indicating that I am in the wrong. I turn and glare at her, "I am not wrong he is going to get himself hurt." I shout.This seems to be the point where Potter loses it, he stands up, his eyes flashing dangerously, and shouts back "One never talk to Marlene like that, ever! Two, this isn't something where you can be right or wrong, it is just my choice, Princess. Third, If I get hurt, it's my choice."He is going to continue, but I interrupt shouting "You are going to get hurt don't you care.""You know nothing about me Princess quit talking to me like you know me, you haven't bothered to learn a single thing about me in all these years. You have no idea about the danger I regularly put myself in. I am not afraid of getting hurt." He shouts.I look at his face and I can see genuinely hurt and raw emotion in his eyes. But he's wrong I know him, and I know he is going to get hurt, I think he knows it too. I can't understand why he doesn't care. But I'm way past subtlety "Potter, your forgetting I'm in most of your classes, I have seen you in and out of the hospital wing, more times than most people in this room combined. When you are hurt you don't see the pain you are causing those around you. Don't you see, when your hurt or in pain, it affects everyone around you. It affects your friends, your family, but you don't seem to care." I nearly scream."Evans don't you ever say I don't care about my friends and family because I will do anything in this world for them. And don't try talking about things you don't understand. You don't know why or what caused those injuries and you never bothered to learn, so you don't get to bring them up. He says while drawing his wand before continuing, "and don't even pretend you care about me, you never have in the past and you clearly don't now, so don't try pretending. For years, you have told me just how little you care about me. Just be happy its not someone who you care about getting hurt during the Tournament."How could he say I would ever want to see anyone get hurt. Sure I don't like the guy, but I don't want to watch him get cut or burned. But I'm way past reason. So, I shout with as much venom and disinterest as possible"Huh you make a good point. I guess I should focus on making sure those I actually care about don't participate in the Tournament. I mean maybe the tournament can hurt you bad enough that you'll actually deflate your head and become a regular human being.""You know what, I'll make sure to get you a Beauxbatons banner so you can support a different champion. And when I'm bleeding, bloodied, and broken like you just wished for, don't bother visiting me, you won't be wanted. Just promise me one thing, if I die please don't come to my funeral, I wouldn't really want such a bitch there. But don't worry I'll make sure Sirius puts on my gravestone, Lily Evans was right." He finishes, well turning and walking up the stairs to his dormitory. I feel a little bad because I never meant to go that far, the argument just went too far. Instead of turning and facing our friends, I march up to the girl's staircase furiously.James POVI hear the other Marauders join me in the dormitory, without hesitating Sirius tackles me in a giant hug. I hug him back gratefully. I will never admit it to anyone outside of this room but that really hurt. I smile Padfoot always has my back and this was what I needed."You know you are not completely innocent in that, but I know you know that. Despite that, you didn't deserve any of that. You know that you are the best friend ever right. We will support you no matter what you decide. Marlene, Alice, Dorcas, and Mary as well." Remus says offering me a reassuring hug. I laugh and look at Remus gratefully, he didn't hold back, didn't say I was innocent, but told me the truth and I needed that."Yeah Prongs, everyone has got your back. You know most of the school will have your back. I know Evans is a special case to you, and you don't have much choice in it, but just do your best to ignore it. She doesn't know about anything she brought up, otherwise, she wouldn't have said those things." Wormtail says before tossing me a chocolate frog. I grin a Wormtail, ripping open the packaging. Chocolate always makes people feel better."I also should add, that she didn't mean all of that even a blind person can see that. Just ignore it mate. We all know it's untrue. Now, when were you gonna tell us about entering?" Sirius asks"Tonight, once it was just us, I didn't really want to get lectured or have a scene like that." I say honestly. I really just wanted to avoid a scene, but I was obviously going to tell the Marauders, I tell them everything.I see Wormtail passing chocolate frogs to the others before taking one himself. I look at the scene and smile my anger and sadness gone, looking at my three best friends, my brothers, and know there is nowhere I would rather be.Yes, the fight was absolutely ridiculous and over-emotional, but that was the idea, James and Lily know how to push the others button perfectly, worsening their arguments.

(Sept. 2nd 1976)James POVI am the first one to wake up, right as the sun rises, and I put on my workout clothes. I have to stay in shape for quidditch, Dumbledore didn't say whether quidditch would be canceled. I leave the room and head for the entrance doors. Once I am outside the castle I begin to run, taking a wide lap around the forbidden forest. In my head, I can't help but recall the events of the previous night. Why did I have to get into a fight and piss off so many people? I mean on a normal day I expect nothing less than insults and threats, but I really didn't need the argument with Lily. What is worse is that Alice knows I am thinking about entering the Triwizard Tournament. She will not hesitate to hound me until I agree to not enter. She can be really convincing when she wants to. I think my best option would be to avoid the subject as much as possible, then she might forget about it and leave me alone. After about an hour of running, I go to the quidditch pitch and head into the locker room. I grab a couple of dumbells and head out to the pitch. It is a rather muggle type of workout but it makes me stronger, so I don't really care what others think about it. I do different exercises with weights, occasionally pausing for water and rest. I have about thirty minutes until I have to head back. I move into exercises without weights, push-ups, sit-ups, planking, etc. At around 8 am, I head back to the dorm, passing a few kids I recognize. I stop when I see Mason Mclaggen, a fifth-year chaser on the Gryffindor team."Hey captain, still doing the morning workout I see. Any idea if quidditch is still going on this year?" He asks"No idea Mason, but Dumbledore did not mention whether it would be canceled or not in his speech last night. I plan on asking Minnie about it when I get the chance." I say."You'll let me know once you know?" Mason asks"Course, but you still better be ready for preseason training, I plan to start the second week of school, with just the team members. If you see wood, let him know for me will you?" I say. The preseason workout was something I started last year as it was my first year as captain. We ended up winning the whole thing, so I am definitely planning to repeat it."We are doing that again, shit! I'll let Wood know, see you cap." He groans, running off to join his friends. I reach the common room, and then up to our dorm room. I see that Remus is packing his bag, Peter is still asleep and Sirius is in the shower. I grab my shower things and take a quick shower. Afterward, I quickly and messily throw on my robes and grab my bag."Padfoot come on we're going to be late, stop playing with your hair." Moony callsWe as a group then head down to breakfast at about 8:15 leaving us 45 minutes to eat and to grab our schedules. We arrive at the great hall and we are some of the last ones there.I take my seat next to Marlene and begin to pile toast on my plate. I turn to Marlene and Dorcas and say "I already spoke to Mason but I'm letting you guys know now that assuming quidditch isn't canceled, which I am going to ask Minnie about today, then we're going to start our preseason workout, next Friday." I say, hoping they don't complain too much, knowing that the workouts are hard."Again, seriously, I thought we were done with them, it is so much work" Marlene complains."Thank god, it gave us such an edge last year." Dorcas says happily. I am happy at least someone appreciates my workout routines. I am looking around for Frank because I still need to talk to him about Quidditch. Then I realize Alice is there.I look at Alice knowing she has a huge crush on Frank and I realize that if anyone knows where Frank is, it would probably be Alice. I ask her "Alice, do you happen to know where Frank is?""Yeah, he's sitting down at the end of the bench next to Caderac, Shirley, and Madison." Alice replies automatically. I smile gratefully at Alice while she has a rather starry-eyed look and then I look over and see she is telling the truth."I bet you five galleons that Frank complains about having to do preseason training." Marlene says, I laugh to myself, Frank is one of the hardest workers on the team, there is no way he is going to complain."You are on," I sayI walk over to Frank and say "Hey, Frank congrats on you know on Head boy, you deserve it. Do you know anything about Quidditch? Is it still happening?"Thanks, James. I haven't heard anything on Quidditch being canceled, so I can only assume it is still happening." He says reassuringly. That is a good sign if Frank hasn't heard anything."I know you are going to be busier than the rest of us, so, there is a bit of leeway for you. I'm planning to start the pre-season training next Friday, it will be about the same amount of work as last year, three or four times a week. However, you do not need to worry, if you have to skip any of the sessions go ahead, just give me a heads up okay." I say I know Frank has it hard being Head Boy and being on the Quidditch team so I don't want to add to his stress too much."Thanks, I know it is going to be busy, but your sessions really helped me out last year, so I don't want to miss too many." He says grinning.I grin, "At least someone appreciates my hard work, Marlene and Mason were both complaining earlier." Frank rolls his eyes at that. I give him a quick bro hug before heading back over to my friends."Well that's five Galleons Marly, He said and I am quoting here your sessions really helped me out last year." I say while sticking out my tongue.She glares back before fishing out the gold from her pocket and holding it out to me. I roll my eyes, I really don't need the gold, it was more just proving a point. Instead of taking the gold, I say "Marlene it's fine, butterbeer is on you next time we are at the three broomsticks together.""Deal!" she says just as Minnie walks down from her seat at the teacher's table. She has to give each of us our schedules individually. Just as he notices her heading in our direction, Padfoot says "Minnie, I'm so glad to see you, it has been too long since we have spent any time together. I am really looking forward to our detention."I laugh at the expression on Minnie's face which is halfway between outrage and amusement. Sirius and I are the only ones that can cause such a reaction, from the stern Professor.She replies "I have told you several times already not to call me Minnie. I should award you a second detention, but since it is so early I will give you a pass. Now it is time to give all of you your classes, and no interruptions." She says giving, Sirius and I particularly hard looks.Sirius was up first, after a quick conversation with Professor McGonagall, he is cleared to take Potions, Charms, DADA, Muggle Studies, Transfiguration, and Herbology. He wants to be a hit wizard and piss off his family, so I guess it makes sense.Lily was next, this time it took no time at all, she was cleared to take the same subjects as Sirius except Alchemy instead of Muggle Studies. I think she wants to be a healer so again it makes sense.Alice wants to be an Auror, so I already know the subjects she wants to take. She is taking the same core classes as the other two but also takes Astronomy. I think it is because her father taught her it when she was very young.Remus is taking the same core classes as the others but his elective is Arithmancy. I know he wants to be a teacher but isn't too confident about his job prospects, because he is a werewolf.Mary was next taking Charms, Muggle Art, Ancient Runes, Ancient Studies, History of magic, and Art. I think she wants to either be an artist or an archivist.Marlene was next, I knew she wants to become a professional Quidditch player. I think if she doesn't go for Quidditch, she will want to work for the ministry. She is taking DADA, Charms, Potions, Transfiguration, Ghoul Studies, and Care of magical creatures. She is happy I think to be shot of Herbology.Dorcas is taking DADA, Charms, Transfiguration, Care of magical creatures, Potions, and Music. I know if she could, she would be a musician but that is unlikely, so I think she plans on becoming a monster hunter. Tracking down out of control beasts, that are hurting people.Peter is the last one before me and I know it will take slightly longer than the others. After a rather lengthy conversation between him and Minnie, Peter is cleared to take Divination, Xylomancy, Herbology, Earth magic, Astronomy. I know he wants to be a herbologist.Finally, it was my turn, and I wait as Minnie approaches.She says " you received all O's in your OWLs, I was very pleased when I saw your results. you have requested to take Potions, DADA, Transfiguration, Charms, Herbology, and Magical Theory. I can grant you all those subjects, here is your schedule."I smile I really want to become an Auror and I need to take all those subjects plus magical theory which is my favorite subject. I quickly walk over to Sirius and quickly swap schedules. We have five subjects together, only our breaks and electives don't line up. I quickly check with Marlene and Dorcas we each have four classes together. Peter and I share 1 subject and Mary and I share one subject.My scheduleMonday Potions, DADATuesday Herbology, Potions, CharmsWednesdayThursday Magical TheoryFriday: TransfigurationToday, I only have Magical theory which isn't so bad. I love the professor. It is only a couple of hours anyway. I wave goodbye to my friends and head to the Magical theory class. In the class, only 6 students besides myself ended up taking it. 2 Hufflepuffs, 2 Ravenclaws, and a Slytherin. The Hufflepuffs were Mandy Machada this stupid, stuck-up, Pureblooded girl who is obsessed with me. She has tanned skin, long dark brown hair, and bright blue eyes. Ruby Field is the other, a nice, hardworking, smart, and athletic girl. She is on the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, she has deep-set brown eyes. Her luxurious, wavy, brown hair is worn in a style that reminds you of a cascading waterfall. She is short and has a slender build. Her skin is black. The 2 Ravenclaws are Katie Hunt and Vladimir Watts. Vladimir Watts, I don't know him very well, I just know he is on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team. He has droopy chestnut eyes. He has straight, brown hair is worn in a style that reminds you of a horse's mane. He is tall and has a feminine build. His skin is chocolate-brown. He has prominent cheekbones and small feet. Katie Hunt is smart and rather attractive. She has deep-set chestnut eyes. Her thick, straight, brown hair is medium-length and is worn in a utilitarian, business-like style. She has an athletic build. Her skin is pale. She has hollow cheeks and large feet. The Slytherin Hannah Hanson, I don't know much about her whatsoever, I just know she hangs out with Lucinda. She has deep-set eyes the color of sapphires. Her fine, curly, red hair is short and is worn in an elegant, business-like style. She has an hourglass figure. Her skin is cream-colored. I get there unsure of where I should sit. I notice an empty seat next to the wall and Ruby Field. I decide to take that seat as the little I know about Ruby is that she is a kind and smart girl. "Hey Ruby, your taking Magical Theory to?" I ask casually."Hey, James" Her voice a little higher than I remember, "Yeah, I love the subject, it is so interesting. I mean, I love learning about the formation of Jinx and Hexes. Plus, Professor Neal, is an awesome teacher, she is always encouraging us to do our best." Ruby says, rambling a little bit."Oh my god, I am so sorry, I am rambling a bit aren't I." Ruby says "I just, I become a nerd when it comes to stuff like this."I don't know why she is so nervous, I mean I tend to ramble a bit as well, so I don't mind. I guess I should try and make her more relaxed. I am trying to make a new friend."Hey, I don't mind you should hear me ramble about this subject, my friends go on and on about how much of a nerd I am." I say, happy that she seems more relaxed."Okay, good I was hoping you wouldn't be scared to talk to me. The Triwizard Tournament seems interesting doesn't it, I am surprised they brought it back." She says.I am not surprised she brought it up, it is the topic on everyone's mind. So I answer "yeah it was a real shock, but I think it will be entertaining, and hopefully safer. What subjects did you take this year, I mean besides magical theory." I ask hoping to steer the conversation in a slightly different direction."Charms, Transfiguration, Ancient Runes, Potions, DADA. Pretty much I took everything to become a curse-breaker. How about you? What did someone as smart as you take." She asks giving me a strange look. I think a curse-breaker is awesome. It would be a really cool job."Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, DADA, Herbology. I took what I needed to become an Auror." I say, enthusiastically.She smiles about to reply when the professor walks in and says "Welcome back everyone but it is time to get to work." Professor Neal is a fair-skinned woman who has a particularly nice cologne, and she has a cut on her right hand. She has a narrow face, a broad nose, and angled lips. Her black eyes are round and she has a monobrow. She has knee-length, thick, brown hair and a receding hairline. She wears a complimentary foundation for an immaculate look. She has short arms, a narrow torso with large breasts with a defined waist, and short legs. She doesn't like to teach large classes and she is not one for structure. She is very kind to us and loves when we show independence and her passion and enthusiasm match ours.I smile and settle in as she begins her lecture about the importance of NEWTs.Timeskip to the end of class"Okay, for homework, write a 1 foot 8-inch long essay on the creation or theory of a jinx or hex of your choice."I smile at Ruby and say "Until next time." And give a small bow before leaving the classroom.She blushes and giggles as I leave, with Mandy glaring daggers at her. I wonder what that is about as I head to lunch.Lily's POVI look over my schedule given to me by Professor McGonagallMonday Potions, DADATuesday Herbology, Potions, CharmsWednesdayThursday AlchemyFriday: TransfigurationNot a bad schedule I think to myself. I can't help but smile and wonder what Alchemy class will be like. I don't know the professor, but the subject sounds very interesting. I mean it is a combination of Potions, Charms, and Chemistry. Hogwarts doesn't usually offer it but apparently, there were enough students interested in it for the school to offer it. I go to the library and spend my first 2 hours on a break. We come back for lunch, I eat lunch with nothing special going on. Just Potter talking about his magical theory class and describing his new friend Ruby Field. She is one of Thomas's friends. For me, I am not a big fan of her, but she is nice enough. After lunch, I head to class, I am not one of the first there and look around to see who is already there. Sitting already is Severus Snape, ew, Wilkes again ew, Benjy Fenwick, Emmaline Vance, Greta Catchlove, and my boyfriend Thomas. He is reading a book, looks to be the one from America, with Greta on one side and an empty seat on the other side. Greta is Thomas's friend, she is slightly overweight, she has medium, shoulder-length blonde hair, soft blue eyes. I don't know her very well, but Thomas has introduced us. I walk over to Benjy and Emmeline and say "Hey Benjy, Hey Emmeline, how are things.""Great, things are going really well, I can't wait to start this class." Benjy says"I am surprised they even offered it, it usually isn't." Emmeline adds,I smile and say "True, I jumped at the chance to take this course, I couldn't miss it." I add, quickly taking a peek to see if Thomas has noticed me yet.Emmeline seems to have noticed my action because she says "Go on I'm sure he will be happy to see you, we are okay."I smile and wave goodbye before taking the seat next to Thomas. "Hey Thomas surprised to see me!" I say enthusiastically, smiling when I see his startled expression."Lily! You are taking this class! That's amazing! What do you think it'll be like!" He replies excitedly."Well, I mean, I heard it is a mix between Potions, charms, and chemistry, so it should be interesting." I say conversationally.He seems interested by this and says "Well I'm glad I love all of those subjects. I can't wait for the other wizarding schools to come. I mean Beauxbatons is where Nicolas Flamel came from, so you have to assume they know something about Alchemy."I am not surprised he knows about Nicolas Flamel because he reads just as much as me. "Yeah, I think that will be the only interesting part about the Triwizard Tournament, someone is going to get hurt." I answer"Lily, you remember Dumbledore is one of if not the greatest wizard of all time, him working along with the ministry will make sure it is safe. I mean if we can't trust them, then who can we trust." He replies. Okay, so Thomas has a little more faith in the government than I do, so I am not surprised he is taking this perspective but it's pretty annoying. Why am I the only one who doesn't seem to think it's a great idea?"I just think in the past tournaments there were so many deaths, why bring it back now. It makes no sense. They can't make sure accidents don't happen." I say a little more passionately than I intended."You are right a guess Lily, I am still going to hope and be optimistic, and hope things end up fine." He says placatingly, at least he can see my perspective, I am glad. I begin to pull out my own book. I look over and see Greta is already reading again, guess she wasn't interested in our conversation. I realize I may have been a little aggressive with Thomas and I should probably apologize."Sorry, Thomas, sometimes I get a little passionate about things. I didn't mean to sound aggressive." I say, hoping to make things better.He smiles and looks completely calm, and says "it is okay Lily, I am used to your passion so don't worry, I am not upset. I really just understood your point of view and you did make good points."I am more relaxed now, I didn't upset or scare him, thank god. But sometimes I wonder if he just agrees with me instead of sharing his true feelings. Okay, Lily calm down a bit, you are overthinking things."So, your taking alchemy is that for your future career or interest purpose only?" I ask trying to shift the conversation. "Well, I want to work in the department of muggle relations. I think it's a good combination of my muggle and magic side. I want to use both." He says. I think that would be good, he is always good at fitting in on both sides."Why aren't you taking Muggle studies then?" I ask confused."I checked with Professor Sprout and since I was raised and live in the muggle world outside of school, I don't need to take the course because I know enough. Plus, there is an exam for situations like that which I can take in 7th year, that I can take without taking Muggle studies." He explains.That is actually really surprising, I didn't know that about the ministry but I guess it helps to have a magical parent. I was about to answer when the teacher walks in and with a straight face says "welcome to alchemy." Before starting on a lecture about the importance of NEWTs and the history of alchemy.Timeskip to the end of class"Okay class, that is all we have today, but be prepared, this is how all our other classes are going to be. For homework, I want 2 feet on Nicolas Flamel." He says.I grumble as I get up, this professor, Professor Porter was an absolute bore. He just kept lecturing in a monotonous voice. He has dark-skin and has an unadventurous feel about him. He has an oval face, a well-formed nose, puffy lips, and has dark brown eyes that are triangular. He has bleached white hair, that is short, fine, and worn as a short bob. He has a muscular neck, broad shoulders, and a heavy torso."This is going to be a long year ain't it?" I say to Thomas."Hopefully not, maybe it is his first time teaching. Give him a chance Lily. He says, I think he is probably wrong but I let Thomas have his hope. He gets up along with Greta and they head towards their Common Room,"see you later in the library?" He asks Hopefully."Yeah, right after dinner, we can work on this stupid essay." I say smiling.He smiles one last time before heading off.I get up and head back towards the common room wondering who is going to be there, I hope Marlene, Alice, and Dorcas are there.I enter the common room and see my friends in the center of the room. Remus looks to be reading a textbook on arithmancy, Alice seems to be pretending to be listening to Marlene, Dorcas, and Potter, but really listening to Frank's conversation. Finally, Marlene, Dorcas, and Potter seem to be working on quidditch tactics. They are obsessed with quidditch and spend way too much time on it. I sit down and Alice seemingly breaks from her daydream and asks "how was class?""Gave us a long-ass essay to do and spend the whole class lecturing in his monotonous voice. It is going to be such a long year." I complain."Shame." Alice says,"Yeah that really sucks." Marlene says yawning"You know you could give it a couple of classes." Dorcas says rolling her eyes."We will see I guess." Putting my bag down, pulling out my book, and joining them.Before beginning to read I ask Potter "Did you ask McGonagall about Quidditch yet?""Yes, I did right after lunch, she didn't really give me a straight answer, so I am going to assume there's something. Hence the planning." He explains. That's weird, why wouldn't Professor McGonagall give him an answer. Guess we will see. And I open my book and begin to get lost within its pages.Boring Chapter I know, but also necessary, I needed to give a better idea of who certain characters are and introduce classes. I also wanted to show what regular Hogwarts life was, sort of. This is also all building up to a series of events, so just be patient. If there is anyone actually reading this please comment and give feedback that would be really appreciated.

(Sept.4 1976)Lily's POVIt is the weekend, woohoo, I mean I would be more excited except we got this really annoying and long transfiguration essay that I have zero clue how to do. At least I got to sleep in, I mean it looks to be about 9 am right now. I quickly get dressed, I brush my hair, and I put on a bit of make-up. It looks like everyone but Marlene is already awake, so I go over and gently shake her awake. "Come on, everyone is already awake, so you should get up." I say.After, forcing Marlene to wake up, I head down to the great hall and see the rest of my friends sitting and having what seems to be a serious discussion. Everyone in the great hall mind you seems to be on edge, either having serious conversations and reading the daily prophet. As I approach my friends, they immediately stop talking. The paper that is in Alice's hand magically vanishes. I look and see Potter holding his wand out under the table. I know immediately that it is Potter who vanished the paper, I just don't know why he would. I then look at the rest of the group and it seems to have been the groups' idea to vanish the paper. Why the fuck is everyone hiding something from me. It must be something really bad, as they seem to be having a silent debate about who's going to tell me, so I decide to wait patiently and eat my breakfast instead. I grab some porridge and begin to eat. As I am eating I notice Mary for the first time. Her eyes are red and puffy as if she had been crying. She also looks absolutely terrified. I decide to take a look at the rest of the group. All of them have grim looks on their face and the Marauders look absolutely livid. I decide if they aren't going to tell me, then I am going to have to ask."What happened? And don't try and lie to me, I can read your facial expressions, something serious happened.""Dorcas, your up." Potter whispers, I think hoping that I wouldn't hear."Fine. James hand her the copy of the Daily Prophet, it might be easier to explain if she reads it first."He hands me a copy of the Daily Prophet and my mouth drops at the sight of the article.What the fuck, another attack are they fucking kidding me. How am I supposed to have a fucking life when there are so many people like me being hunted down and killed. I, I mean why are muggle-borns so bad, like they make us seem like we are diseased or something. What did we do to deserve this treatment? Worse, they seem to have killed a larger number of muggles this time. It might be my family next. I really don't want everyone's fucking pity. I really do not want anyone's pity so I run away from the table. I just want to be alone. I can't deal with anyone right now. I need somewhere to be alone, I just need to be alone. I think about where to go but I cannot decide. I am subconsciously heading to a place I know will be empty. Without much thought, I end up in the back of the library, in a small alcove that no one seems to know about. Everything seems to become blurry, my mind can't seem to shake the thoughts and names of the dead. Alfie-Jay Sexton 22, Iain Mcgee 30, Maysa Savage 6, Alice Savage 30, Kareem Gilmore 20, Michaela Figueroa 85, Hiba Nicholson 14, Aaron Nicholson 43, Jaylan O'Moore 35, Jez Faulkner 19, Margie Webber 28, Nellie Drummond 32. Repeat. Why can't I get their names out of my head? I want to scream but I am physically incapable of doing so. My body begins to tremble, I just, I can't get them out of my head, I can't scream, I can't do anything. Alfie-Jay Sexton 22, Iain Mcgee 30, Maysa Savage 6, Alice Savage 30, Kareem Gilmore 20, Michaela Figueroa 85, Hiba Nicholson 14, Aaron Nicholson 43, Jaylan O'Moore 35, Jez Faulkner 19, Margie Webber 28, Nellie Drummond 32. Repeat. I want to move, I want to do anything. I want to cry, I want to scream, I want to fight. I can't. All I can do is sit here, shake, and replay the names in my head. Alfie-Jay Sexton 22, Iain Mcgee 30, Maysa Savage 6, Alice Savage 30, Kareem Gilmore 20, Michaela Figueroa 85, Hiba Nicholson 14, Aaron Nicholson 43, Jaylan O'Moore 35, Jez Faulkner 19, Margie Webber 28, Nellie Drummond 32. Repeat. That is so many for just one attack. So many, they're getting stronger, bolder, and less afraid. They only caught two death eaters. Two. And yet Alfie-Jay Sexton 22, Iain Mcgee 30, Maysa Savage 6, Alice Savage 30, Kareem Gilmore 20, Michaela Figueroa 85, Hiba Nicholson 14, Aaron Nicholson 43, Jaylan O'Moore 35, Jez Faulkner 19, Margie Webber 28, Nellie Drummond 32 are all dead. They are all dead. THEY ARE ALL FUCKING DEAD! All the ministry can do is come up with 2 fucking culprits. They are so fucking useless. THEY ARE SO FUCKING USELESS. HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSE TO FEEL SAFE IF 12 PEOPLE DIE AND ONLY TWO ARE CAUGHT. I even know their army is going to grow. It is going to get bigger and bigger. Soon they are going to have a fucking army. And the ministry is doing nothing. THE MINISTRY IS DOING ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING. HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSE TO FEEL SAFE IF THE MINISTRY CAN'T PROTECT A SINGLE ONE OF US. FUCK THEM, FUCK THIS, FUCK THE MAGICAL WORLD. WHY THE FUCK CAN'T I MOVE OR SCREAM OR STOP FUCKING TREMBLING. GET OUT OF MY HEAD. Alfie-Jay Sexton 22, Iain Mcgee 30, Maysa Savage 6, Alice Savage 30, Kareem Gilmore 20, Michaela Figueroa 85, Hiba Nicholson 14, Aaron Nicholson 43, Jaylan O'Moore 35, Jez Faulkner 19, Margie Webber 28, Nellie Drummond 32. Repeat. I sit there trembling and shaking for who knows how long. I LOST TRACK OF TIME A LONG TIME AGO. I WANT TO SCREAM, I WANT TO DO ANYTHING. Then, an even worse image popped into my head, my family. What happens if my family is next. Not my parents. What if tomorrow I read the paper and see Azalea Evans 46 and Jefferey Evans 48. I see their dead lifeless bodies, over and over and over and over again. Petunia's picture is added to the list in my mind and everything is that much worse. The shaking and trembling reach its breaking point and I can feel myself losing consciousness. I can't take it anymore, the pressure is becoming all too much. FUCK IT ALL, FUCK THIS, FUCK LIFE, FUCK. With that, I lose consciousness. My dreams filling with visions of the dead and my family being murdered in various fashions. I wish I could wake up scream, pound, and cry everything out, but sadly that is not a fucking option. I am stuck watching my family die, over and over again.Dorcas POVWhere is Lily, we haven't seen her since breakfast after she ran out. It has been nearly 3 hours since then and no one has seen her. Marlene, Alice, Mary (although she is severely shaken from today's events) and I are all looking. After searching, the Library, the castle grounds, potions classroom, and so many other places that Lily happens to like, we are becoming desperate. I look desperately at Marlene and say "We need the Marauders, they might know a place we don't."Marlene seeming to understand nods her head and says "You and I will go find them we are faster, Mary, you and Alice keep searching, you might get lucky.""Sure, sounds good. But, we need to hurry, I am really starting to get worried."We run back to Gryffindor tower and knock on the Marauder's closed door. "Go away, Marauders business is currently going on." Sirius shouts, sounding serious.Really not in the mood for this, I shout "IF YOU SHITS DON'T OPEN UP THE FUCKING DOOR, I AM GOING TO BREAK IT DOWN UNDERSTOOD." They are wasting our fucking time, I really can't deal with their antics right now.Quickly the door opens revealing all four marauders blocking the view into the room. Remus asks "What is the big emergency Dorcas, you shouted like someone's life depended on it."I waste no time and reply immediately, "Lily has been missing for hours now and we can't find her anywhere."Remus and the marauders exchange a quick look before saying, "You will need to excuse us for a few seconds, we can find Lily but it has to be in private, okay."We nod, knowing the marauders like their secrets. They close the door, and we can hear words being whispered. I turn to Marlene and ask "Do you really think they can find her that quickly?"She has a thoughtful look on her face before replying "Course I do, they are probably tracking everyone in one way or another."Now the fact that she says that seriously makes me think because if I'm being honest, they seem like the type of people to do that.They return a few seconds later and James says "She's in the library, Remus will take you, we have got business to take care of." Remus begins to lead us away from their room while the others turn away closing the door."What are you guys up to?" Marlene asks, which is a good question given their behavior.Instead of giving a straight answer Remus turns and says "You will find out soon but right now focus on Lily. She probably isn't in the best state, so we need to be there for her."He tells us to speed up and we are in the library. I'm lost, I thought we searched the whole library already. I find Alice and Mary already there. I got your message, we're here, now where is she. Remus looks completely at ease and motions for us to follow. He leads us to the absolute back of the library and a small alcove. There we find an unconscious Lily."We need to get her to the hospital wing right now!" Alice shouts,but Remus stops her with a raised hand and says "She probably just passed out due to stress, it has happened to me before. Marlene, Mary wake her up gently, being as soft as you possibly can.Marlene and Mary listen to his instructions quickly, and lightly poke and shake Lily to get her up. She wakes up not long after, but she is trembling, and can't seem to do much of anything. I look over at Remus to see he is completely calm. He gently pulls a potion from a previously unknown pocket and hands it to Marlene. "Make sure you don't spill, it is not like we have extra." he instructs quickly.Marlene and Mary help Lily drink the entirety of the potion and she starts to calm down. When the shaking stops, she seems to be able to move again. She immediately falls into Marlene's arms hugging her tightly. Marlene seems to understand that Lily just needs to be held nothing else. I look over at Remus and he seems calm as ever but also really relieved that Lily is okay. He makes a follow-me gesture and leads me away from the group."Remus, where are we going, my friends need me!" I say, Failing to grasp why he is doing such a thing.Remus gently says "Dorcas, you are the most responsible out of our friends, therefore, I am trusting you with these." He pulls out a second small box that contains 6 small vials of what look to be potions.He trusts me, I can't help but smile, he didn't ask for Alice or Mary, he asked me. I can't help but be curious about what potion he is giving, or even better how many potions he and the marauders have. So I ask, "What's in these vials, even more curiously what was the first potion you gave Lily? How many potions do you Marauders have in storage?"Remus looks at me seriously as if considering how much he should really say. I hope he trusts me because I definitely trust him. He starts "Okay Dorcas, I will tell you about as much as I can. So, the first potion I gave Lily was a calming draft, used to calm and relax someone. We marauders keep it on hand in case of emergencies."That explains why Lily calmed down so quickly, and I have respect for the Marauders for being so prepared, they seem to always want to be able to help their friends and I can respect that.Remus continues "These vials are filled with dreamless sleep potions, we gave you as many as we possibly could. We won't have a chance to make more of the potions for a couple of weeks. If you are smart, however, they should last about 6 days for both Mary and Lily."I smile, those vials will really help with their nightmares and could really improve everyone's sleep in our dorm. "Now with your final question, the marauders and I have several potions stored for various circumstances. I can't really talk about the others because it would lead to more questions and we don't have time for that." He finishes.I can't even be upset with him for not telling me because he was straight-forward and honest. I run back over to my friends and find a much calmer but not better Lily. I can't tell what she's thinking but I know she isn't okay. I look at the vials and I know how to help her. I am not the best at being there emotionally, but I can protect her, and I can help her and that's what I am going to do.Lily's POVI look over and see Dorcas heading back with Remus. The potion Remus gave me really helped. I am definitely more relaxed. I am trying my best to get the images and names out of my head but I can't. So instead, I focus on the rage bubbling inside of me. I want justice for them and I want to be someone fighting for it. I want to stand-up for muggle-borns and muggle-born rights. So, I slowly stand up and with Marlene's help start to walk towards Gryffindor Tower. I am still feeling unsteady and dizzy. I still feel like I want to scream, so I ask the others to cast the muffliato charm. Once they do I just scream. I don't stop, I just scream and scream until there is nothing left inside. I motion to them that they can take off the Muffliato charm and we continue to make our way up to Gryffindor tower. Once the portrait hole is open, the girls and I take the nearest seats. Remus however, makes a quick excuse before making his way up the stairs. I would normally wonder what's that about but I choose to ignore it. I look over at Mary and see her red eyes and realized I should have handled it better for her. I scooch a little closer to her and wrap my arms around her."Hey Mar, sorry I wasn't here for you today, I just couldn't take it. I know it was probably just as bad for you as it was for me." I whisper sincerely, I feel terrible, I was a pretty awful friend today. I didn't even think about how bad it could be for Mary. She's muggle-born too.Hugging me back just as tightly, She whispers "You know I don't blame you, Lily, everyone reacts differently."I squeeze her showing her just how much she means to me. She then whispers "I know you don't want to talk about it right now, that's okay. But if you ever and I mean ever need to talk, I am here for you, Lils.""Just like I am here for you Mar, I know the others might not fully understand but I am muggle-born too. I know the world we're in." I whisper. And it is true, I want to make a difference, not just for Mar but for every other muggle-born at Hogwarts and outside the castle.I look over at our friends and they look worriedly at us, but I know it is because they care. We all sit in a comfortable silence until Marlene finally breaks it. "I know we should be focused on the whole attack, but I think we should be concerned about what the marauders are planning. They have been in their room all day and they seemed absolutely enraged by the news. I am worried they might be planning something completely insane."Thinking to myself, what Marlene said is probably true but I think it may be best just to ignore it. I seriously don't want to try controlling them today. Plus, they are enraged about muggle-born killings, why should we be mad. Alice is the first to answer "You might be right but we can't worried about that, it is not our problem, it is theirs. I think we should just ignore it Marls." I send a grateful look at Alice because it really wasn't worth it.Marlene shrugs and we continue to pass the time discussing various things.Timeskip to DinnerStill no sign of the Marauders, apparently, Potter, Peter, and Sirius haven't been seen outside of their rooms since breakfast, which makes me truly believe they have something special planned. Even Remus only came out to help me, which I am thankful that he did. We get down to the great hall, most of the students are here for dinner, most of them seem to be talking about the attack. So many of them look scared. They are probably worried that their families will be the next targets. I HATE VOLDEMORT, HE'S RUINING SO MANY LIVES!As we take our seats, I feel someone give me a tight hug. I turn around and see Thomas is there. I hug him tighter. He takes a seat next to me. I hope he doesn't try to talk about it, I really don't want to.He says "Lily I am so sorry when I heard the news I tried to find you. I don't know how you must be feeling. I am here if you need to talk about it? I know you must be scared."He has no idea, but I just really don't want to talk about it. I say "thanks, that is very sweet of you, and I will talk to you if I need to."I look over at Marlene desperately, asking her to please change the subject. She seems to understand because she looks over at Thomas and asks "How has the first couple of days been, did you get lots of homework?""No, I just had that Alchemy essay about Nicolas Flamel. It honestly wasn't that bad, he's a very interesting person. I mean he created the only known Philosopher's stone." He answers."I mean true that is interesting, but would you really want to live forever? I mean at a certain point wouldn't you want to move on." She replies.I can't help but send a quick thank you look to Marlene. Not that I don't want my boyfriend here, I just don't want to talk about the attack right now. I focus on eating as he and Marlene start discussing the pros and cons of living forever. All of a sudden there is light everywhere. I see fireworks going off in every direction. But I notice these aren't the regular magical fireworks. The marauders must have made some adjustments. The fireworks explode and suddenly, the sparks fall to the tables carving something. On each of the tables, there are 3 different faces, with a name and age and the words justice for the twelve. On the Gryffindor table, there is Hiba Nicholson 14, Aaron Nicholson 43, Jaylan O'Moore 35. The Marauders aren't done it seems. They stride into the great hall looking absolutely enraged. They honestly look like warriors. Each of their faces are holding matching snarls. Peter looks like he has had enough of everyone's bullshit. He looks part scary, but deep down you can see he is a little scared himself. Sirius has this look that says if you get in my way I'll fuck you up. He looks like someone ready to kill and someone who is a little insane. Remus has this scary calm look on his face. He looks wolfish like the wolf is inside of him is making an appearance. Finally, Potter, he looks like an honest to god commander. He is standing so fearlessly and so confidently. His hazel eyes are flashing with so much rage, and passion you just hope you are on his side. Together, they look unstoppable. They are all muttering spells and identical flames leave their wands and burn their way onto the walls. They wrote messages like say no to muggle-born killing, look out for one and other, stick together, don't lose hope, stand up and fight, protect each other, see something report something.However, the most striking was the most prominent of them all. It read fuck Voldemort, Fuck anyone who supports him. The guts to actually burn something like that is unthinkable. Instead of sitting down or wasting any more time, they walk right back out without the slightest hesitation. I can't help but get on my feet and clap for them. This is absolutely incredible. Soon others join, and most of the great hall is cheering. I complain a lot about their different pranks. But at moments like this, I can't help but admire the Marauders. I know they will stand up for what is right and they are one of the few able and willing to do so in such a public fashion. The looks on their faces said it all. They believe wholeheartedly in protecting muggle-born students and nothing will stop them from doing so. It is moments like this that make me respect James Potter and prevent me from outright hating him. He and the others do what needs to be done. As we settle down, we see Professor McGonagall get up from her seat and follow the Marauders, I am guessing to give them their punishment. I wonder what they'll get. I hope it isn't too bad, they really don't deserve it.I look at my friends and see they are grinning but also look to be in awe of what the marauders just pulled off. Marlene who seems to be the least surprised says "Well, that was amazing guys. Alice, good call for telling us not to interrupt them.""Yeah Alice, what they pulled off was absolutely perfect. It is just what the school needed. What the muggle-borns needed. The most popular students in the school and some of the most powerful students, literally just told anyone who supports muggle-born and muggle killings to fuck off and that they have our backs." Mary adds"Well, I knew if it was taking that long it was going to be special." Alice answers. I laugh, Alice always seems to know what the Marauders are doing even when the rest of us don't have a clue."Hope McGonagall doesn't punish them too badly, I know they probably broke 30 rules but still it was for a good cause." Dorcas adds I can't help but agree with her. It did seem to be a lot of rules though."It was probably only twelve Dorc. I mean at least one of them has the entire rule book memorized at this point and so they most likely made sure to break one for each of the deaths." Marlene adds. That really does sound like a marauder thing to do and was designed so only the professors and Dumbledore would get it.Before I can chime in Thomas says "They still broke the rules they should be punished. I don't care how necessary or sentimental they were being, they still broke the rules and they should be punished. It will only encourage them and others to break the rules otherwise. In all honesty, she should have punished them in front of everyone for that reason."I look at him disbelievingly, how can he seriously be upset over this. I know he loves the rules and everything. But no one deserves to be punished for something like this. Not something that is standing up for innocent people. Not for standing up against injustice. I mean, I normally don't endorse their pranks but come on, this was definitely special circumstances. But, I am really not in the mood for an argument so I just shake my head and continue eating, although I am still annoyed with him. Clearly, my friends have other ideas."Are you fucking kidding me, I don't give a fuck about rules. Last night, 12 people were killed in the name of or on You Know Who's orders, and everyone except the marauders are just bitching about it with their friends. They fucking did something." Dorcas says in her usual blunt fashion."Exactly, they did something and made a difference. You must know the type of value the marauders hold in this school. They know it and know how to use it, by saying no in public, they made sure others will follow just to be like them." Alice adds."They just did a good thing, I am a muggle-born I should know. They don't deserve to be punished." Mary says."Yeah, knowing them they knew they would get in trouble and still did it. That's what makes it even better." Marlene finishes.Thomas clearly annoyed says "Well I don't expect you to understand, you are not prefects. But as a Prefect, it is my job to control trouble and that is exactly what it was. Lily, you agree with me right?" He asks, I look down at my plate avoiding his eyes. He seems to understand, however, and gets up shaking his head. He returns to the Hufflepuff table without another word.This was another sort of chapter meant to set the scene. In the previous chapters, I was focused on creating James's storyline and struggles. This chapter had no James's POV, for a reason as it was set purely to show Lily's set of mind and I hope at this point Thomas's character is much more clear and that he has a personality other than Lily's Boyfriend. As always, if there is anyone actually reading this please comment and offer feedback thanks for everything.

(September 6th, 1976)James POVI wake up, beginning my usual morning routine, today is the first DADA class of the year. There have been strange rumors going around about her classes. I am looking forward to it, hopefully, she is better than the usual idiots running the class. Since the job is famously jinxed, we haven't really had a good teacher. At least for Padfoot, Moony, and I, we haven't learned a single useful thing. I hope this one is different. I mean first I have to get through a potions class. Potions happens to be my least favorite class. Slughorn is such a pompous person, he collects people based on their family and offers favors/connections to students, in exchange for adding them to his collection. It is ridiculous, he tried to add Padfoot and me in the first year, but naturally, we said no, knowing what he was from the beginning. Plus, once we started to become well-known troublemakers, we suddenly weren't as welcomed as before. I don't really care though he only wanted us because my dad invented Sleekeazy's hair potion and Padfoot because his family is part of the sacred 28. I mean who cares where someone is from. He never invited Moony even though Moony is as smart as anyone, just because he is a werewolf. But gits like Snivilous and Rosier, who have rich families are welcomed without hesitation. The idiot can't tell when someone is evil. Anyway, we head down to breakfast at our usual time, leaving just enough time to eat and then to head to class. We take our seats next to Marlene, with Alice, Dorcas, and Lily having already left to get to class early. Who knows why anyone would do such a thing. But I guess being the crown jewel of old Sluggy's collection herself, Lily has to arrive at class early. What a waste of time.Anyways I turn to Marlene and ask "are you excited to return to potions class today. I wonder what he'll give us anyways?"Marlene who hates the class as much as I do, and who can blame her for it, the whole class is just sitting around and following a long list of precise instructions. I don't see why I will ever need to know such a thing when I become an Auror. What do they expect me to do in the field, stop whatever I am doing for a couple of hours just to brew a potion? It is so ridiculous.She says "Please don't remind me, I want to forget as long as I can. And I really don't care what he assigns us to do."Moony decides to pipe up "He will probably assign us something difficult, and offer us a prize for who can accomplish it best." Moony is usually right about things like this so I trust him. But in all honesty I don't care too much. I just hope the class isn't too full, I really don't need that right now. I check my watch to make sure we aren't running late."Yeah, and then he'll be gushing over Evan's and Snivelious's work." Padfoot adds,"Of course Padfoot, and any other person who has a rich family, just so he can get something from it." I add."How much do you want to bet he tries to invite the two of us again to his Slug Club? As if we would ever accept such an offer." Padfoot says laughing. That's true he is still trying to invite us to his slug club, which is stupid we're the least Slug club member-like students in the school."Can't really blame him can you, I mean we offer so much. Maybe he is hoping my dad will come up with a potion that can save what little is left of his hair." I say as all of us laugh because Slughorn has strawberry blond hair, that is seriously balding."But what about all the perks of the Slug Club. I mean besides good food, you get to have conversations with a group of people where 99% of them have their head stuck up their asses, and a teacher who will pretend to help you now and then call you for something bigger when you are older." Marlene asks pretending to be serious.We all laugh again because she just described the Slug club perfectly. I check my watch and realize we have fifteen minutes until it is time for class. We all get up and head to the castle grounds. I hand each of them a cigarette before grabbing one myself. If I am going to get through potions I really need this. When we finish, we have about 5 minutes till class, but we are not worried. We know this school like the back of our hand. We take a couple of quick short cuts before arriving outside the dungeon with three minutes to spare. It seems to be a large class this year. Since we are the last ones there we take a quick survey of the class.There seem to be 6 Hufflepuffs, 7 Ravenclaws, 5 Slytherins, and 7 Gryffindors. From Hufflepuff, there is Ruby, Edgar Bones, Isabelle Doyle, Alex Traore, Thomas Linnety, and Andy Reid. I don't know much about most of them except Ruby, Thomas because he is Lily's Boyfriend, Edgar Bones, and Alex Traore from quidditch. Edgar has droopy black eyes that are like two dark pits. He has straight, black hair that is short and is worn in a utilitarian style. He's got a beard and mustache. He has a masculine build. His skin is deeply-tanned. He has high cheekbones and a small mouth. Alex on the other hand has droopy slate-gray eyes. He has curly, long hair that is the color of chestnuts and is worn in a complex, style. He is tall and has an athletic build. His skin is light-colored. The Ravenclaws are Aldon Knight, Lawson White, Winter Huntingdon, Katie Hunt, Liz Khanna, Kylar Hicks and Vladimir Watts. I know about Katie and Liz from Remus and Vladimir from quidditch. The Slytherins are Lucinda, Milly Hudson, Hannah Hanson, Wilkes, and Snape. The only ones who I know that are semi-decent is Lucinda and her friend Hannah. Right as the class is supposed to begin, the doors to the dungeon open revealing the potions classroom. In sit 5 tables of 4 and 1 table of 5. Padfoot, Remus, and I immediately take seats at the back. Not long after Marlene chooses to sit there as well, because apparently Lily, Alice, and Dorcas sat at the front. Everyone knows Marlene hates sitting in the front, too much attention from the teacher. I look around and see four cauldrons full of bubbling potions.I nudge Marlene gesturing to the cauldrons and say "Do you think he's going to make us start preparing one of those potions?"She sniggers and asks "You know those are what you should be able to brew after you take your NEWTs right?"I roll my eyes, surprised Marlene has such little respect for the length we go for our pranks and other activities. I mean the potions around the classroom are easily recognizable and for various reasons, the only potion out of them that we haven't brewed is the Amortentia. The other potions polyjuice potion, veritaserum and felix felicis are all potions we have made and have an emergency supply of. We only use them for absolute emergencies, well except for the polyjuice potion, we usually just use that for pranks. If we need answers from someone or to prove to each other we are telling the truth, or if we are playing games at parties then the veritaserum comes in handy. Now the felix felicis potion, we have the smallest stalk of and we have only ever used it once. That was the night Padfoot sent Snape to the Whomping Willow. Without it, it would have turned out much worse.I turn to Marlene and say, "You know very well that we have brewed at least two of those potions. So don't bother hiding it." Sirius and Remus snickering behind me as they are remembering the night we introduced veritaserum at one of our parties. It was a real shocker to most. Granted Marlene knew and still took it.Marlene faces me and says sassily "Of course I knew, I was merely answering your stupid question from before." This causes Sirius and Remus to laugh louder."Shut up Padfoot, or should I tell them about the time you blew up the cauldron when we first tried to make veritaserum. Or the time you spent a week in the hospital wing after you screwed up the Felix Felicis." I retort. Moony is now doubled over laughing, nearly falling out of his seat.Marlene looked at Sirius incredulously and says "He's kidding right."Padfoot glares at me before replying "No he's telling the truth, although I still claim the other three are partially responsible for not paying attention. Although Prongs over here should remember I know his embarrassing stories as well"Marlene is now laughing hard, I guess she's picturing Sirius's blackened face and burnt hair.Sirius glares and says "Alright Prongs your turn. The first time we were making polyjuice potion, he put the wrong hair in it and spent the week as a half-human half rabbit. We hid him up in our dorm and said he had a mysterious illness."Well, it is only fair Padfoot got me, I mean I got him right before. However, what isn't fair is Moony laughing loudly and probably disrupting the whole class along with Marlene. Before we can get him back Slughorn seemed to have already begun class and faced us. He says "Since you four don't feel the need to pay attention or even to remain quiet in my class will you please identify what these four potions are."Slughorn really is making the mistake so many others make with us. They think just because they haven't taught us something, it means we don't know what it is. They are proven wrong time and time again and yet here we are.I look at Moony, Padfoot, and Marlene and we have a silent conversation to decide who goes first.Padfoot decides to go first and says in a ridiculously false cheerful tone of voice "Well of course professor, nothing would fill me with such joy as being able to help you out. So, the first potion" He points to the cauldron with Polyjuice potion, "is polyjuice potion. It is identifiable by its thick mud-like look and the bubbling, which is characteristic of the polyjuice potion before the hair of the person is added. After that, the color and taste are unique to the person you are changing into. Polyjuice potion allows a user to transform into another person temporarily, which can mean 10 minutes to twelve hours depending on how well it has been brewed." Sirius stood up took a little bow causing most of the class to chuckle.Marlene goes second, and says trying to contain her laughter, "the second potion" she points to the potion with Amortentia. "the one with the mother of pearl sheen and spiraling steam is Amortentia. The most powerful love potion in the world that smells different to each person. For instance, I smell my mother's perfume, the quidditch pitch, and something musky. However, it doesn't create real love instead it creates infatuation or obsession." Slughorn looks shocked, should've expected it Sluggy, we have done it hundreds of times before.Remus went next, he unlike the rest of us was dead serious, although someone who knows Remus can hear the humor in his voice. He says "The third potion or the clear, odorless one is veritaserum. It causes the drinker to tell the complete truth. It doesn't have a taste so it is undiscernible if it is put in a drink. It takes a full lunar cycle to brew."Moony went above and beyond the other two, I think to impress Slughorn, which he should, because when we first brew the potions, it was only due to Moony's help that we didn't destroy Gryffindor tower. Granted we were in the third year but still. You can see he has impressed Slughorn, which I am glad. I realize everyone is waiting for me. I decide you know what I am going to one-up Padfoot.I quickly stand up and give a nod to the professor before walking to the front to stand next to the last potion felix felicis. I begin, "Okay class, this final potion would be called Felix Felicis or better known as Lucky potion. You can identify it by its gold color, Ruby can you confirm that this is potion gold?"Ruby from her seat nods her head. I can see Thomas giving her a glare. I continue "you can also identify it by the droplets of gold that are leaping like gold-fish above the potions surface. Now this potion takes six months to brew. Now given that it is also known as the lucky potion can anyone tell me what it does?"Sirius leaping up and down in his seat says "pick me Prongs, Oh pick me."I grin and say " "He replies "It makes you lucky." I know at this point I am pushing my luck, but Slughorn is looking so funny that I decide to finish."Now the side effects of the potions is it causes giddiness and recklessness with overuse. So essentially you become my good friend Padfoot over here. It is also extremely dangerous to brew." I finish with a slight bow before heading back to my seat, quietly high-fiving both Marlene and Sirius. Most of the class have smiles on their faces seeming to enjoy our antics. That is except for Snape and Wilkes (but that's normal), Thomas and Liz and Lily. Although, I can see Lily is trying really hard to hold her glare in place. I also look over and see Ruby and Edgar telling Thomas to lighten up.I nudge the others and whisper "I think we have some very angry fans. Marlene, I think you should watch out for Princess after class."She laughs and says "She's not that mad she just wants to start potions it is her favorite class."I roll my eyes and whisper "If I get hexed I am so throwing you and Moony under the bus you were laughing the loudest."Marlene answers "Don't you dare or I will tell some stories of James potter Five year old."Oh god, those can't get out, no way, never. Suddenly Slughorns voice brings me back to reality."Okay thank you for all of those details and you happen to be correct. Now today, we will be having a little contest. Whoever, in the time remaining brews the best Draught of Living Death will receive a vile of Felix Felicis. However, I must explain Felix Felicis, is banned from all sporting events and exams. It is supposed to be used on an ordinary day to make that day special." Slughorn explains.I look around and see certain people really eager to begin, Snape, Lily, Liz, Ruby, Thomas, Edgar, Aldon, Kyler, and Katie all look ready to jump out of their seats. I know I am not going to win this so I start to wonder if it may be better to do something more productive. I look over at Padfoot and Moony and whisper "Do you think you guys can cover me when we go collect our ingredients, I am going to steal more ingredients for the dreamless sleep potion."They both nod their heads. "Sure thing prongs, that is actually a really good idea." Moony repliesWe make sure we are the last to get ingredients as we know we really don't need to win this contest. As the others grab ingredients for themselves and me for today's potion I gather the ingredients we are going to need. After we take what we need we return to our seats, and I quickly hide the stolen ingredients in my bag with the undetectable extension charm. Everyone is going to need more dreamless sleep potions, so the more we can make now, the better.Timeskip to the end of the contestNone of our potions are going to win anything, I can already see that although Moony's seems to be the farthest. Slughorn passes our table without pausing. Padfoot whispers to me "Five galleons on our Lilyflower."I whisper back "do you think I am an idiot there is no way in hell she loses." I mean it was going to be her, Liz or Snape but I guess we will see. Slughorn looks at Snape's potion and mutters something to himself before going to Lily's Potion. "My god, this is farther than I thought anyone in this class would get. This is wonderful. Very good job Miss Evans. For the rest of you 2 feet on the proper way to brew this potion and its uses." Slughorn says before handing her the vial of Felix Felices. Padfoot and I exchange a look before rolling our eyes.Timeskip to LunchMarlene, Sirius, Moony and I are one of the first to arrive at the great hall after the long potions class. We quickly fill our plates and begin to eat. Not long after we are joined by Peter and Mary who were on a break and who seemed to have spent the entire thing together. Finally, Dorcas, Lily, and Alice join us, Dorcas and Alice have wide smiles on their faces, while Lily's face turns into a glare. I quickly try to think up an excuse that can get us to leave before she gets here, but it will only delay the inevitable. She sits down and loads food on her plate without saying a single thing. On the other hand, Dorcas and Alice sit down and say enthusiastic "hello's" and "hi's". After grabbing some food, Alice is the first one to break the silence."Great performance today in potions, I could not stop laughing. Professors should have learned by now not to try that trick." Alice says."Well I am glad you enjoyed our performances, I mean it was a fun time. We really couldn't resist could we Padfoot. Not after the golden opportunity, Slughorn gave us." I say laughing because Slughorn literally presented us the opportunity on a silver platter."Well, I happen to love when Professors try to put one past us, it produces some of my best material. Plus, did you see his face, it was amazing." Padfoot adds, and I think back to the disbelieving and shocked face. It truly was something to see."Reckon it'll prevent us from being invited to future Slug club meetings?" I ask."No way prongs, you and Padfoot are way too valuable." Moony answers.It looks like Lily has had enough of being a silent bystander as she stops eating and says in a low yet loud whisper "Was it really necessary, I mean you disturbed the class for what a laugh. To what embarrass Slughorn. And why were you even laughing in the first place, some of us were trying to learn. I even saw you three were the last ones to grab ingredients. You weren't even trying."Padfoot and I exchange a look before he answers "Look we didn't know class had actually started when we were telling stories. We honestly were shocked when we realized we were disrupting the class.""As for embarrassing Slughorn, yes we tried to do that only because that was the exact same thing he was trying to do to us. And merely providing the answers was the part where we tried to embarrass him. The rest of it was because the class seemed so gloomy and bored that we decided to cheer everyone up. Come on all but like four of you were laughing outright. And deep down I know you were laughing." I say rolling my eyes at how she was still trying to be mad about something so small."Yeah Lily, we wasted what 2 to 3 minutes and in reality, we were offering perfect information. So don't tell us what we did was that bad. And as for us being last to grab the ingredients, we knew our potion wasn't going to win, so we didn't try to. We had a reason for going last, it's just we would rather not talk about it right now." Padfoot adds with an exasperated expression. I can't help but agree, I seriously don't see an issue in anything we did. If the class enjoyed it what's the problem. And given Saturday's events, we really needed to restock our dreamless sleep potion supply."I was not laughing, I wanted potions to continue. But I guess it wasn't that bad as the class did seem to enjoy it. I am guessing you knew the answers because you have brewed all those potions?" She asks"All except Amortentia, Lily, and they were all used in a noble and creative fashion." Remus answers with a completely straight face. Inside, I know like the rest of us, he is laughing his head off."That's really advanced stuff, I mean I brew potions on my own time but never something as complicated as that. When did you guys do that, I mean its impressive magic. Although, I don't think I will agree with how it was used" Lily adds with an impressed look.I knew she liked advanced magic but I am surprised she isn't mad because brewing all those potions violates so many rules."We brewed Polyjuice potion for the first time in the third year. We needed it for our Halloween costumes, remember when we went as the Professors." Moony answers. Best Halloween ever, everyone had a great laugh."Oh! I remember that, one of your less harmful pranks. It was really impressive and third-year mind you, that's commitment" Lily says, with a genuine smile on her face."Veritaserum was 4th year although we ended up using it for the first time in 5th year, remember at my birthday. party." Sirius adds. Before lily can reply as she looks less than thrilled about the second potion."Finally, we tried to brew it in the third year with terrible results. It wasn't until the early fifth year we managed to brew a small vile of it. The use of it will remain a secret as it would be too complicated to explain." Peter finishes.Lily seems a third amused, a third mad, and a third curious. I know what she is mad about and I am hoping to get out of it before her anger falls upon me and before she decides to ask questions.So I say "Yes, we knew how dangerous it was, but we didn't blow the Gryffindor Tower up, so I think we can count that as a success. Like I've said before sometimes the reward outweighs the risk. Now if you'll excuse me I am going to smoke." I get up quickly as Lily seems to be lost in my words.Just before I leave Alice whispers in my ear "She was laughing at your whole performance." Giving me a wink as I leave.Timeskip to DADA class.I walk into the DADA class with Sirius and Remus. We enter the class and it is a bit less crowded than our potions class. The same 7 of us from Gryffindor, there are 5 Hufflepuffs, 5 Slytherins, and 6 Ravenclaws. From Hufflepuff, Edgar, Ruby, Alex, Isabelle, Steven. Just like last class I only really know Edgar, Ruby, and Alex. I give a quick wave to Ruby. From Slytherin, Snape, Mulciber, Avery, Lucinda, and Milly. What a bad group the only one who I can stand is Lucinda. Finally, from Ravenclaw, Benjy, Emmeline, Aldon, Lawson, Worton Davis, and Katie Hunt. I know Emmeline pretty well, she plays for Ravenclaw and great at parties. Through her, I know her boyfriend Benjy Fenwick. Katie, I know a little bit, she shares many classes with us. Worton, I know too, but unfortunately, he is a giant prat, an arrogant git who will do anything for popularity. We find seats at the back of the class in the far left corner. I hope this year's teacher is actually decent."What do you reckon this time around?" I ask Padfoot and Moony"Well you remember her from the start of term feast, she looked tough and experienced." Padfoot says."Plus, Dumbledore knows the times we are in, there is no way he hired a slouch." Remus says sagely as if he is a 100 year old man. I disagree, times have been getting dark for a while and we still haven't had a good DADA professor but we will see I guess.Suddenly, the teacher enters very calmly and purposefully, striding right to the front of the class. "Okay, class I am your new DADA professor, Professor Wyatt. You will call me nothing but Professor Wyatt or you will face detention do you understand? Okay, moving on." She says but then she suddenly sees a group of students with their books out. She continues "For today, please put all of your books away, as I will only be speaking today."After we all put our books away, she continues "Now from what I have been told, you have had 5 different professors teach you in the past 5 years. I have looked into them and what they have taught you and no offense they were all terrible. That is why it surprised me how many of you have made it to NEWT level. Now usually if I was teaching this class I would stick solely to what would ensure that you pass your NEWTs. However, these are dark times and you need to know how to fight and how to protect yourselves. And since I am only staying here one year, I don't really care about any punishment the ministry can hand me. Now a bit of a background on myself. So, I attended Durmstrang academy many years ago where I took both OWLs and NEWTs. After, I worked for the ministry of magic in Sweden. After, a couple of deaths in the family, I was forced to move and sell most of my possessions as I was in need of a fresh start. So I moved to Great Britain, where I worked as a tutor, specializing in DADA. I also became a bartender to help with bills. And let me just say it is not the easiest job in the world as you can tell. After working another couple of odd jobs here and there, I saw a position open for teaching DADA. Since it was my specialty, I applied and got the job, probably because it is jinxed, and yes I know about the jinxed business." She pauses as if considering where to go next. Something about her is giving me a weird feeling. Her story really doesn't make sense. Is she really telling me barfights caused her injuries? She must be lying or hiding something. I know from treating Sirius what dark arts injuries look like and her scars are caused by a dark spell. I don't think a bar fight could really cause such a thing. Also, why'd she move to Britain she never actually said. She seems guarded for some reason. She begins to speak breaking me from my thoughts "Now, I know you are probably wondering what I know about DADA and why I am qualified to say your other professors are idiots. To start off, your professors seem to have spent an overly large time on rather rare creatures that you will most likely never encounter in your life and that belong more in the Care of magical creatures section. They seem to have taught you nothing on how to deal with darker creatures like Dementors or Inferi, which these days you are likely to face. Second, they seem to have shown you little demonstrations on how to actually perform spells, rather than relying on theory. Third, they haven't put you in any applied situations. But the biggest issue is the way they have portrayed the Dark arts. The Dark arts and dealing with evil creatures and people isn't about listing off a bunch of spells. No, it is about quick thinking, making the right decision, trusting yourself, and your instincts. It is about fighting your ingrain fear and facing down impossible odds. In the real world if you make a mistake, guess what you die and there is no going back. Sure you can practice in the classroom, study the theory but until you get out there, you don't know anything. I will be showing you what it is really like. I will be showing you the worst of the worst and how you deal with it. You may not want to hear it, but if you are going to take this class then you are going to be forced to grow up and learn what the world really is. This will include learning and facing the three unforgivable curses, learning how to duel properly in a life or death situation, and facing real-world dark creatures. Now if you have any questions, I will not be answering them as they are not important right now. If anyone in this class does not take this class seriously you will be kicked out understood! If you ever need to leave, ask first, and I will decide whether or not you will be allowed to leave. Now let's begin."Her speech is interesting, she will definitely teach us, and she knows more than the previous professors. But her speech and story makes no sense, she talks about facing the real world, dealing with the darkest things life has to offer. I mean she talks the same way my parents do, and they have faced real-world dangers. She talks about growing up and acts like she has been in life and death situations and yet in her story, she didn't really say she had any experience in the matter. She talks like she has experienced something or somethings that have permanently changed her. She also got a strange look in her eyes when mentioning the dark arts and especially the three unforgivable curses. Even more confusing, she seems to be breaking ministry guidelines and not having a care in the world as if the ministry can't punish her. Maybe I am just being paranoid. I really don't know. I will see what my friends have to say at the end of class. But one thing is for sure she definitely has my interest peaked.Timeskip to the end of classFor the rest of the class she focused on dementors, and she has definitely faced dementors before. The way she talks about them and the way she is able to describe the effects of them clearly shows that. Also, she also knew a lot about how to protect yourself against dementors. She tells us about patroni and the best way of dealing with them. She told us that patroni will be for our seventh year. However, she still told us exactly how to cast the spell and explained that if we want to learn how to cast a patronus we should do it on our time. Granted, with the dementor attacks on the rise the Marauders and I each learned how to cast our individual patroni to protect ourselves and our friends in emergencies. I return my focus to Professor Wyatt as she says "Okay class, that is all I expect 2 1/2 feet on dementors and how to face them due next class."With that, we got up to leave."She was amazing, she really knows what she is talking about." Padfoot says with an excited voice. He seems really happy for once."Yeah, I think Dumbledore finally got it right." Remus adds. They turn to me waiting to hear my opinion on it. I decide it would be best just to agree with them for now and wait and see if she does anything suspicious. If she does then I will tell them. Besides why squash their hopes when really, I don't have any proof anything is wrong. I should trust Dumbledore, and since he trusts her, I should trust her.So I say "She definitely knows more than the rest put together. One thing is for sure guys, DADA just became the most interesting class we will be taking this year."Sorry it was long, but I introduced certain characters that will turn out to be important later on. Now the whole potions seen, it is just the majority seem to always assume the marauders are bad at potions. Yet Remus is quoted as saying that James and Sirius were brilliant at anything they tried. And I also think that yes the Marauders keep emergency potions supplies on them because they literally had a map of everyone on the school, and dealt with a werewolf regularly. They seem like the group of students, to always have something to clean up their messes, which probably happened often. Now as always, if you read this please comment, and offer feedback it would be appreciated.

(Sept. 8th, 1976)James POVI wake especially early this morning and quietly walk over to try and nudge Sirius awake. He was supposed to wake up at the same time as me, but alas no such luck, the great lazy prat. We have got so much to do today, he needs to wake up. Today is the full moon and Moony has been looking especially ill the past couple of days. When he wakes up we will have to take him to the hospital wing. It is going to be a long night for him. Tomorrow also happens to be Peter's birthday which means we have to plan a big party for him. We are so not ready and we so don't have enough time. However, luckily enough neither of us have class. We really should be doing our homework, but we will find a way to manage it. Anyway, I finally wake Sirius who looks confused as to why I woke him up so early. I can't believe he forgot, but I can't yell at him right now because that will wake the others up and ruin the whole surprise. I motion for him to quietly get dressed and follow me downstairs. He glares at me for a second before quietly groaning. He gets dressed in a rather loud fashion, we are only lucky that Wormtail and Moony are heavy sleepers. Once we reach the common room he groans and says in a whiny voice "Prongs why did you have to wake me up so early, we've got a full moon tonight and I was hoping to get a nice long sleep."I roll my eyes, impatient that Sirius forgot. I mean we have so much going on today, and I really need his help. "Are you forgetting what tomorrow is Padfoot?" I ask impatiently. I mean come on Padfoot wake the fuck up.I suddenly see recognition in Padfoot's eyes, he must finally be awake. "Oh shit, I can't believe I forgot. We have so much work to get done." He says in a slightly panicky voice.I look at him and tell him my plan."Okay, Padfoot first we are going to go to the Kitchens and see some of the House-elves and see if they are willing to make some food for tomorrow. Second, we are going to magically hand out invitations to the people we trust. Third, we are going to take Remus to the hospital wing, and then we are going to let Peter stay with him, while we make our way to Hogsmeade. We will get him our gifts and supplies for his party. We will make it back and hide our supplies in the room of requirement. We then are going to spend the afternoon with Remus and keep him company while Peter is in class. Then, when Peter is done with his class, we are all going to spend the remaining time with Remus, until we are kicked out. Then, we gather the supplies we are going to need for the night and hide them in our usual place, making up our different excuses for where we were all day and night. Now once we get back instead of sleeping, you and I are going to wait for Wormtail to sleep, and then we are going to set up his birthday prank. Finally, we are going to go to sleep and then wake up early and celebrate Peter's Birthday." I explain as Padfoot groans. I know he's going to help but I can't help but agree with him, we are going to have little to no sleep for the next couple of days. But they are both our friends so we know we have to get it done.He looks at me and says "Then let's get going because we are going to need every second."We leave the common room, and I quickly pull out what looks to be a blank piece of parchment and say I solemnly swear I am up to no good. Words start to appear on the blank parchment. It is the marauder's map, a map of Hogwarts that shows everyone on it, and every secret passage. The marauders and I made it in our 4th year although it took us nearly two years. It is a way to avoid trouble as much as possible. It has saved us from so many detentions as now we know when a professor is coming and when they are going to bust us."Seems clear right now no one we need to steer clear of, Filch is currently on the fifth floor chasing Peeves it seems." I say, before beginning to walk towards the Kitchens. Throughout the walk, we encountered nobody as it seems most of Hogwarts was still asleep. We reach the entrance to the Kitchens which is secretly hidden. To access it, all we have to do is tickle the pear on the portrait. The door swings open we find hundreds of tiny House-elves cooking food for breakfast in a feverish fashion.When we walk in, many of the house-elves smile and say, "Master Potter, Master Black, what an honor it is to see you again. Did and come with you?I smile over at the House-elves, they are always so nice and kind and helpful."Unfortunately Remus and Peter were unable to make it today although they wanted to tell all of you hi and they will be down to visit soon." Sirius answers smiling at the house-elves.The House-elves all smiled and jumped up and down excited at the chance to see Moony and Wormtail again. I walk over to the two house-elves we know best. Candy a House-elf whose eyes look like pieces of candy and Peely, whose skin looks like it is peeling off. "Hey Candy, Hey Peely, I was wondering if you would be willing to help us out with something?" I ask, I think they will say yes but I don't want to force them, they already have a lot of work."We would be honored to help and his friends. What is it he needs from Candy and Peely?" They ask while bowing."So tomorrow is Peter's Birthday and we are throwing a party for him. We were wondering if you could make some food for the party. We would need a cake, some of your canary creams, ginger newts, chocolate eclairs, pumpkin pasties, and maybe a treacle tart. You see you guys make the best food that we know of and we wanted to make Peters Birthday special, so we were hoping you would help." I say seriously because there isn't a single person I know who can cook better than the House-elves."We would be delighted to cook for Peter's party sir. We shall bring everything to your dorm as soon as we are done, sir." They say happily as they start to get back to work."Bye guys" I wave as I head back over to Sirius who was talking to other house-elves."So, the House-elves will cook for the party. How was it on your end?" I ask"All of his favorites will be plentiful during tomorrow's meal." He says grinning."You can't help but love them, can you. So willing to help." I say because really they are awesome, they were willing to help right away. Besides, we always have a good time when we visit them."Darn right you can't, I love some of those House-elves they are always so cheery and happy. We owe them so much." He says thinking the same thing I as I am."So now invitations, who do you think we should invite." I ask him as it is important we only invite people who won't report or get us in trouble. If we invite the wrong person it could be over before it begins.We decide to head to the common room so we can write down who we want to invite and decide how we are going to invite people."So we do it by going house by house naming which students in each year we want to invite and when we are finished, you write them down." Sirius says.I begin to make the list, writing down each house giving enough space for several names from each house."Okay, so we should start with Slytherin. I think we can start by eliminating all those Pureblood nutjobs. I also think the prefects from that house can all be eliminated. Now also eliminating my brother, Rowin Leonard and Adrian as they are all not the partying type. I think Winnie Paterson, Lucinda Talkalot, Talia Thunder, Hannah Hanson, Elizabeth Ekholm, Garrett Beck, and Alexander Webb should be the Slytherins." He finishes, I can't help but agree with him it is a good list and I don't think a single one of them will tell on us. Although, if it wasn't for Sirius's family situation I would've invited Regulus. But I guess it is best to keep those two apart. So I write down the names of the Slytherins he wants to attend."Next I say Hufflepuffs, we should eliminate Cattermole's group as they would be the first one to tell someone about the party. Travis Pieters and Chris Gonzales who are friends of Frank should come, along with Holly Brown and Aaron Lockwood. I don't like the other 7th year girls they gossip too much." I say as the group of girls in Hufflepuff are responsible for three-quarters of the school's gossip."In the sixth year, Edgar, Ruby, Greta, and Thomas should be invited. I don't think the rest of the group will let him report this. Besides, he is Evans's boyfriend we don't have much of a choice." Sirius Continues, I can't really argue with him, they are good choices."In fifth year, Tim, Nick Murray, Andrew Ryan, Amy Anderson, Otto Bagman. I mean Tim and Nick are two of the most popular students and Andrew, Amy, and Otto are all somewhat popular." I add thinking about what I know about the fifth year students."Also, we should invite Cara and her friends, they might not be the partying type but remember they get along great with Tim and his friends. I nod my head in agreement and write down the names of the Hufflepuffs."From Ravenclaw, in 7th Year, Hestia, Ash Jennings, Angelle Mullins, Anton Frost, George Martin, and Reagan Adams. They are all nice and friendly and fun to party with." I say, looking over at Padfoot who is nodding his head."Benjy, Emmeline, Lawson, Vladimir, Aldon, and Katie from our year. We know most of them pretty well. I think they can be trusted." Padfoot adds and I think he is right even though I am worried by the number of prefects on our list."Ash Selwyn, Tessa, Sophie Reynolds, and Riley Green. Obvious choices, since their friends are already on our list." I add, finishing off Ravenclaw's house."Finally, the Gryffindors, I think 7th year is pretty easy, Caderac, Frank, Shirley, Britta Macmillan, Madison Mills, and Jack Hawkins. We know them pretty well, there is no way they are going to get us into trouble. Plus the Head boy and girl will be there." Sirius says while looking at me, so I roll my eyes because he is obviously right."I think we can skip the sixth years because obviously, we are all going." I say with a little humor in my voice because we are the ones throwing the party."5th-year we should just stick with the members of the groups already going. So Mason, Damon Byrne, Sammie Horvat, Hannah, Brooklyn, and Nika Daniels. They all have friends going and are not the type of people to tell." He finishes. I hope he is right, most of the groups are trustworthy, the only group that slightly concerns me is Cara's group because they aren't necessarily the partying bunch. However, I also don't think they are the type to tell on someone, so hopefully, we got it right. So, I add the remaining names to the list."So, any idea how we can contact each of them without others finding out." Sirius asks. I think about this and come up with a great idea. But we need to hurry up and get it done."I have an idea, Sirius, you remember how a golden snitch has touch memory, so it can remember who was the first to touch it." I ask, he nods his head looking confused."What if we charm chocolate frog cards so that when the person who the invitation belongs to touches it, it reveals the invitation details, and when they let it go, the card becomes blank again." I say hoping he will understand because it means that if someone steals it, they won't be able to see anything.His eyes wide with excitement nearly yells "Prongs that's an amazing idea but is going to take time, we better get to work."As marauders, we have eaten a large number of chocolate frogs in our lifetimes, and as a group, we have grouped the chocolate frog cards, since none of us actually collect them. In total, we have enough for several sets of invitations. I quickly, but quietly run up the stairs and grab them, before heading back down to Padfoot. Sirius and I make quick work of the invitations choosing a different witch or wizard for each invitation. After 30 minutes of work, we were finally done. We quickly charmed all the invitations to appear in the proper person's bed before heading up to check on Remus. When we gently woke him up because it is time to take him to the hospital wing. Luckily for Remus and us, Wormtail is the only one with classes today. When we wake him, it doesn't look good, he is really white, he's got goosebumps clearly cold, and looks exhausted. It is so hard to watch Moony, what he goes through is terrible."How's it going Moony?" Padfoot asks gently."Wonderful Padfoot, I feel like I can run a marathon. How the fuck do you think I feel." Remus replies harshly. Padfoot winces, he knows he shouldn't have asked that question, Moony is always snappish and angry on full moons. This is due to his wolfish nature roaring to life."Moony, what he means to ask is in terms of previous moons, how bad? We need to know what we are going to have in-store today." I say calmly hoping to calm him down a bit.Moony looks at me with his sad eyes and says sadly "I honestly don't know prongs, it is going to be the usual, and I said it a hundred times to you, don't come." I shake my head, Moony always feels down on the full moon and feels guilty for everything that is going on."Moony we are coming, end of the story. Padfoot wake-up Wormtail we need to bring him to the hospital wing." I say, taking control of the situation.Timeskip to dropping off Peter and Remus at the Hospital WingAfter dropping off Moony and Wormtail at the Hospital Wing, Padfoot and I quickly throw the invisibility cloak over us. It is a cloak that renders the wearer completely invisible. It is a family heirloom, passing down from generation to generation. It apparently belonged to the youngest Peverell brothers. With it, we can pass through the halls unseen. We check the Marauders map and decide which passage to take to Hogsmeade. After a quick debate, we decide to use the passage on the third floor behind the one-eyed witch, since the hallway seems to be empty. As we reach it, I take my wand out and say "Dissendium" to open the passageway. After entering the passage we quickly remove the cloak and hide it in our usual hiding place. I look at Padfoot and say "you ready Padfoot, time to go shopping.""Course, it is a big birthday, let's make sure it's memorable." Padfoot says grinning.We first stop at Dervish and Bangs, to buy Peter a pocket watch curtesy of the Marauders. See we know his parents are getting him a fancy watch as it is customary, but we wanted to make his birthday special and show that he's part of our family too. What's different about this one, is instead of tracking the time it tracks the lunar stages and the movement of the planets, to help Peter out with divination and Remus's Full moon issue. We asked the owner to put it on hold at the end of last year. Next, we went to the Hogshead where Dumbledore's brother works. If you pay well enough he is willing to sell firewhiskey and other alcohols.We enter and wave at him. The bar seems to be empty which is good. I approach him and ask "I would like a crate of firewhiskey, some of the Hogshead brew, and Dragon scale as well as a crate of butterbeer."After he gives us our alcohol, I quickly pay, and Sirius picks up our order while I make him invisible to avoid detection."Oi, James why are you not carrying these, you are the quidditch player?" Padfoot yells annoyed, I mean the box he is carrying is kinda heavy, but I still have to pay for the Honeyduke sweets. We enter Honeydukes and I tell him to start heading to the passage while I finish up. I buy large quantities of Sugar quills, peppermint toads, Ice mice, and liquorice wands for Peter. I also buy large amounts of chocolate because it will help Remus for the upcoming full moon. I quickly pretend to leave before making myself invisible and head down to the sellar to catch up with Padfoot. I look at our load and I think we did a really good job."Hey paddy, think we got enough to satisfy Peter for more than a day." I ask, jokingly, we both knew this was going to be absolutely amazing, and Peter is going to be thrilled.Timeskip to the return to the castleWe get back to the castle and quickly hide our stuff in the Room of Requirement. I check my watch quickly and we needed to hurry in order to relieve Wormtail. We learned long ago that it was best to always have someone around Remus during the Full Moons. I nudge Sirius and the two of us sprint through the halls until we arrive at the hospital wing. We enter quietly in case Moony is asleep. Which turns out to be the case. I see Wormtail glancing nervously at his watch. I walk over and pat him gently on the shoulder."Don't worry Wormtail, we're here now, you can make it to your class." I say knowing he is going to have to hurry. I discreetly hand him the Marauders map, knowing it will help him get to class on time.He grins "I'll see you guys after, thanks for this." He then runs out, hopefully, to make it to class on time.Padfoot nudges me, bringing my attention to Moony. He doesn't look good, he looks even paler than this morning, and he has 4 blankets just to keep him warm.I whisper to Padfoot "This is not going to be a good moon is it?"Padfoot looks down at Moony than back at me and whispers back "Doesn't seem that different from usual, so who knows maybe things won't be so bad.""True, but just in case we need to bring our medical supplies back to their usual place, in case of emergencies." I whisper because right now they are up in our dorm, and that would be a far walk if one of us is hurt."Yeah. We also need to hide our injuries better. You know how Moony gets when he hurts one of us. He becomes a lot sadder and blames himself way too much." Padfoot adds. He is right of course, Moony does get much worse if he injures one of us. But I also know Moony and if we lie to him, he will feel that much worse and may even lash out."Padfoot, it is better just to tell him, you know as well as I do that if he finds out we lied to him it would make things that much worse." I say hoping to convince him.He nods I think because he understands Moony as I do.Timeskip to being kicked out of the hospital wing.After being kicked out of the hospital wing, we begin to head back to the common room."So, what is our excuse going to be for Today and tonight?" I ask, knowing we are going to need a coordinated excuse because otherwise we would probably get caught in a lie."I think for today we tell the truth, although we change it so Remus was in the hospital wing with the flu." Padfoot says."I think it'll work, although maybe best not to say exactly what we did or buy from Hogsmeade." I add looking at Padfoot but thinking about the large quantity of alcohol we had bought."For tonight, why don't we say we have found a new secret passage and want to see where it leads. Since no one but us have really used the secret passages out of school, we can easily lie, and show them one we have already found." Wormtail says. That is a really good idea, Peter was always the best at lying and getting us out of the toughest situations."Wormtail that is genius, you are always the best at coming up with them. So we head back to the common room, we only need to last a couple of minutes before we head back out. We get the supplies and then we put them in their hiding spot and then we wait. It isn't going to be a short moon, like in the summer, so we have to be ready." I say picking up the pace. We reach the common room hoping that none of our friends are there. Unfortunately, they are all sitting around the fireplace and look up upon our arrival."Shit." I whisper to Padfoot, we just have the most rotten luck."So, mind telling us where you were all day?" Dorcas asks, sounding a lot like an authority figure."Yeah, and where's Remus today?" Lily asks a little too curiously."Well, for where we were during the day, Sirius and I spent the day in Hogsmeade, gathering certain things." I say while looking directly at Alice pleading for her to understand. She seems to get it and nudges the others trying to get them to understand. Most seem to which is good."Remus on the other hand has the flu, I spent the morning with him before swapping with those two as I went to class." Peter adds convincingly. Hopefully, it will be able to relax Lily's curiosity. We start to make our way to the stairs when we are called back by the girls."So, the flu is it? Is it bad? What are his symptoms? When will Remus get better?" Lily asks, again it is like she suspects or knows. I will have to lie convincingly then."Okay, so it is pretty bad but you know Poppy, it could be anywhere from 1 day to 5 days. Second, he has a fever, he has been vomiting, he is pale, and he has the shivers." I answer hoping I was convincing enough.We turn to start to head up, when suddenly "where are you guys going, you have literally spent five minutes in the common room. Don't you have homework or something?" I turn and see that it is Mary who asked."Well you see Mary, we think we might have found a new secret passageway out of the school. The only issue is we don't where it goes or the dangers it might contain. So naturally, we are going to go explore it. We were first just going to collect some supplies." Sirius answers, doing his best to sound as excited as possible, and to keep the fear about tonight down."I thought you guys knew every secret passage in the school?" Marlene asks surprised."Well, you do know the castle is very large, so we freely admit to not knowing everything about the castle." I say, which is true we haven't had the chance to explore absolutely everywhere yet."Plus, you probably misheard us, we have never said we know every secret in the castle. We have said that we know more than the rest of the students combined. Which is probably what you are referring to. Because I will freely admit we are amazing but even us, the great marauders aren't able to know everything about the school." Padfoot adds, clearly bragging, but I mean he definitely isn't wrong.I look around and most of them are laughing about Sirius's comment. However, Lily is only pretending to. She has been way too curious this entire time, she must know something is up. I can't read her true expression. It doesn't seem right, because she almost seems worried and shocked. I think we should be trying to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.Before we can try to leave she speaks up "Are you guys sure tonight is the best night for this? I mean it could be dangerous, why not try to study it a little more before doing it?" Lily asks putting as much pleading in her voice as she can. I don't know why I exchange a quick look with Padfoot to see if he noticed what I did. She knows something or at least suspects something. We have to be careful tonight."We have made plans for tonight and therefore we are going to do it okay. We are going to be fine we have been preparing for a long time." I quickly say, while nodding at the girls before heading upstairs quickly. We grab the healing potions that will help in case one of us is injured."Timeskip to Remus's arrival at the shrieking shack"We see Madam Pomphrey bring Remus to the shrieking shack minutes before the moon is about to rise.Peter quickly transforms into a rat so he can touch the notch on the tree that will freeze it in place. Once he has done that, Sirius and I follow entering the passageway that leads to the forbidden forest. When we reach Remus, he is yelling out in pain. It is the worst part of the whole thing. Listening to Remus cry and yell because of the transformation he is undergoing is awful. We listen as his screams become louder until they reach an impossibly high point and we know it is time to transform. First Peter turns into a rat, then Sirius transforms into his bear-sized black shaggy dog. Finally, it was my turn and I transform into my huge red stag. I make sure to stay slightly hunched to make sure my horns don't penetrate or break anything. We watch as the last part of Remus's transformation occurs, his eyes change from their kind form to a violent bloodthirsty yellow. The wolf is here. He looks us up and down and smells us before remembering we are his pack. With this confirmation, Sirius opens the door to the shack and we begin to explore the forbidden forest.Timeskip to the end of the full moon.I place the unconscious Remus in the cot in the shrieking shack pulling up a couple of blankets, it shouldn't be long until Poppy is here. It wasn't a terrible full moon as Remus was mostly calm. We have a couple of bruises and cuts but nothing but the bare minimum.I check myself over, before looking at the others, like me Sirius has a couple of scratches and bruises while Peter seems perfectly fine. I ask Sirius "reckon spells will be enough to heal our wounds? Save our potions for another day."He nods and we begin to heal each other with magic. Once we are as well as we can be, only a few smaller cuts and bruises that refuse to heal anymore. Together we head back to the castle, being as silent as possible.When we reach the Common Room, I immediately know we are in trouble. Lily Evans is sitting on the couch reading as if she had been waiting up for us. She suddenly closes the book and turns to face us."So it takes that long to investigate a secret passage?" she asks with a raised eyebrow. Normally, I would be laughing about this because she has absolutely no idea what she is talking about and it shows. I mean some of the passages took many nights wandering the castle to find.In unison, we say "Yes! Do you think we are lying?"She shakes her head before heading up to her dorm. Just before she is out of sight she turns and says "I see those cuts and bruises and your torn robes, don't think I missed that. You could have been investigating a secret passage but I seriously doubt it. Now, remember I have my eyes on you from this point on."I shake my head looking at Padfoot and Wormtail and say "We better be careful from now on. Let's go up and get changed, and sleep." I head upstairs and turn and say "Let's not mention that conversation to Moony, as it will make him worry."We quickly get cleaned up and change, and climb into bed. It takes 10 minutes for Peter to fall asleep, then Sirius and I get to work. It's time for Peter's birthday prank.So that is the end of the chapter. This chapter was showing what the full moon was and showing just how busy the Marauders world was. And of course how the Marauders were definitely the party throwers of Hogwarts. And I think at least in my story to always talk about the full moons and effect on Remus because they were probably the biggest parts of the Marauder's lives. I think some of you reading if there is anyone actually reading, that the chapters are going slow. That will be the case for a few more chapters, it isn't until the start of October that things really pick up speed. I do have this whole book planned at least plot and chapter wise, and September is definitely the longest month with 15 chapters planned. For the other months, it is about 9 chapters a month. I just thought I would offer this so you can an idea of the length of the story. I will promise though that this book will finish, and my update speed will remain pretty much constant. Now as before please comment, and offer feedback.

(Sept. 9th, 1976)James POVAfter finally finishing Wormtail's birthday prank, Padfoot and I exhaustingly climb back up to our dorms and collapse, falling to sleep instantly. Unfortunately, I had to get up a mere hour after I got to sleep because otherwise, I would miss class. I force myself up and trudge to the great hall for some quick food. I smile as I sit down because it would seem the House-elves lived up to their promise. All of Peter's favorites are plentiful at the Gryffindor table. I look around and I see a few people discussing Wormtail's party later and I smile because it means the invitations had worked. I eat as quickly as possible because I want to visit Moony before going to class. Once, I am done eating I rush out, find a deserted corridor, throw on my invisibility cloak before rushing to the hospital wing. I open the doors a tiny bit and poke my head inside to see if anyone is around. Luckily, it seems empty. I rush over to Moony's bed. He looks pale and has a couple of fresh bumps and bruises. However, he looks a lot better than last night, I guess it won't be a long stay in the hospital wing this time. Poppy can really work magic. He is still asleep so instead of removing the cloak or trying to talk to him I just turn around and head to class.Timeskip to after classAfter class where I handed in my hastily scribbled homework and received another essay, I left to head to the hospital wing hoping to find Sirius and Peter there. We wanted to give Peter's gift as a group since it was from all of us and because we wanted to see his reaction. I reach the hospital wing and see they're all sitting around Moony's bed. I enter quietly, not wanting to get kicked out before pulling up a chair next to the others.I say "Hey Padfoot, Moony, Wormtail. Happy Birthday, Wormtail."Wormtail grins and replies "Thanks Prongs loved the pranks by the way."I nod before turning my attention to Moony "How are you feeling Moony, hopefully, better than yesterday right?" I ask deep down hope that he is okay."I'm better Prongs, only a couple of bumps and cuts, nothing more than the usual. Besides, I want to know how you guys are. They refused to tell me anything until you were here." He replies. I am glad he is better, he didn't seem to be lying at least. Moony is the worst liar out of all of us, so I didn't think he was going to try anyway.I look at the other two wondering why they haven't told Moony about last night. Nothing out of the ordinary happened and we have no serious injuries. I decide to ask the other two before talking to Moony. "Why haven't you guys told him?""You know as well as I do, that Moony might've thought we were lying and think that you somehow suffered injuries that were preventing you from visiting him." Sirius says like it is the most obvious thing in the world. And when it comes to Moony's guilt he is probably right."You're probably right, Moony over here is overly sensitive after full moons." I say laughing along with Sirius."Oi, I am not!." Remus shouts indignantly."Moony, you really are." Peter pipes up. Moony looks ready to try and argue some more but sees it is a lost cause.Instead, he asks "Whatever you guys say, now I want to know about last night, and don't try lying to me."Peter decides to go first since he is the one who is perfectly okay. "Okay, so like usual I am absolutely fine. No injuries whatsoever.""I have a couple of bumps and small cuts. I had a few more last night but we were able to heal them with magic, no potions needed." Padfoot adds, saying pretty much the same thing I am about to."I have the same sort of injuries as Padfoot. Nothing new and nothing that needs magic to be healed." I say looking Moony in the eyes so he knows I am telling the truth.Moony takes one last look at each of us as if checking that each of us are okay. Before nodding, accepting that we are telling the truth."Now we're done with Moony being a worry wolf, Peter we wanted to give you our main gift as a group." He pulls out the wrapped gift with wrapping paper which has tiny rats running all over. He hands it over to Peter and we wait to see his reaction to it.When he unwraps it his face breaks into a wide grin. He reveals the gold pocket watch we got him the day before. He opens it revealing the lunar calendar and the moving planets. He faces us and then tackles each one of us in a hug."Thank you guys, this is amazing. I ... I can't believe you would get something like this for me. It is perfect. Truly I love it." He says before giving each of us another hug.The three of us are smiling, thrilled that Wormtail likes the gift so much but Remus clearly wants to explain the gift a little more."Peter, we know that your parents got you your own watch, but we wanted to give you our own watch to show you that you are apart of a second family, you are apart of the Marauders. We thought that the lunar calendar and the planetary movements would be of better use to you." Remus finishes, saying exactly what the gift meant to each of them.This made Peter unable to speak. Instead, Peter walks over and hugs each of us in a harder hug. We hug him back just as fiercely because this is the only point we will get to celebrate his birthday in private. We spent the rest of the time laughing and joking just enjoying each other's company.Lily's POVI wake up late, due to being up really late last night, I don't know how the Marauders do it. They seem to rarely sleep, it is astounding. They got back to the common room so late and I was right about them not investigating a secret passageway. They had ripped clothes, mud, bumps, and cuts littering them, well at least Potter and Sirius. They must've been doing something with Remus but I don't know what. It is far too dangerous to be around a werewolf, friend or not, and those boys would not be stupid enough to risk it. I will just have to keep a closer eye on them for the upcoming full moon. Anyway, today is Peter's birthday and naturally, the marauders are throwing a party. I mean it's a Thursday night couldn't they have waited until tomorrow. It would make more sense with classes. But I guess being the Marauders that doesn't hold too much weight. Although looking at the list of people invited on my invitation it seems like it is a very fun and nice group. They seem to have invited a fair amount of people from every house which is nice. What's more, is the invitations themselves. The magic involved in them is genius. I don't know how they came up with it. You see they charmed chocolate frogs to reveal the invitations when the person the invitation belongs to, touches it. Otherwise, it remains blank. Each person got a different character. Potter definitely picked mine as my character was Queen Maeve. Course I get the card with royalty on it. Probably laughed about it. However, he did do a nice thing by inviting Thomas to the party. Normally Thomas would be the type to tell on someone having a party. But I think Potter and Sirius trusted that Edgar, Ruby, and maybe I would be able to control him. Naturally, it took all of yesterday for his friends to convince him to not report them. Even more annoyingly, I had to have an hour-long discussion with him just to get him to agree to come with me. It's like he didn't care if we would have a good time, breaking the rules in any sense is apparently too much for him. I probably would've gone without him but it will definitely be more fun to go with him. As I got dressed and leave, I wonder what pranks the Marauders have in-store today, I hope they wouldn't have had much time to prepare something. But as I pass the suits of armor, I realize I am wrong. The suits of armor are dressed up with party hats and every couple of minutes bursting into happy birthdays. As I entered the great hall, I see that every single teacher has somehow been forced into a birthday hat and in a banner above their heads reads Happy Birthday Peter! When they had the time to do this is beyond me. They truly are brilliant. I find Alice, Marlene, Dorcas, and Mary already at the table. They all greet me with various greetings. I reply likewise and sit down and I begin to load my plate and I can't help but notice all of Peter's favorites have been made in excessive amounts. Another Marauder move."So, Sleeping Beauty finally wakes up." Marlene says smirking. Damn it I had hoped she wouldn't say anything."I stayed up late reading." I say lying because really they will all just tell me I have an obsession with the Marauder's if I tell the truth.They all roll their eyes as one, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world."So everyone ready for the party tonight?" Mary asks curiously, probably wondering what we were all going to wear."Yeah, it is going to be a blast, the parties they throw are always legendary." Dorcas says, rather excitedly."Did any of you get dates?" Mary asks curiously, although I think the question was directed at the others more than me because they already know I am going with Thomas."I did, Caderac Dearborn, he asked me last night." Marlene says while squealing and bobbing up and down in her seat."Wait Franks cute friend. Grey eyes, yellow hair, tall muscular build?" Alice asks startled, looking directly at Marlene. She of course would be curious given the fact that she has this huge crush on Frank."Yeah, that's the one. I didn't know much about him before but he is hot so who cares." Marlene says as if it is the most obvious thing in the world. Which to her it probably is."I actually got asked as well. You know Lawson White from Ravenclaw. He asked me and since no one else was going to ask I said yes." Dorcas says while looking happy I think that it is because she was asked. Although I know Dorcas doesn't really know or like Lawson."Frank is going with his friend Shirley unfortunately." Alice says disappointingly, while she is looking purposefully down at her plate."Alice they might be going together as friends who actually knows." I say doing my best to cheer her up. Although I think it might be a date, I would rather see a happy Alice than a sad Alice."Did you manage to convince that goody two shoes to finally go with you lils?" Dorcas asks curiously, looking at me straight in the eyes. I don't know why, but I think Dorcas isn't the biggest fan of Thomas. I think she finds him stuck up."Yeah, I did, after a little convincing. And don't call him goody two shoes, his name is Thomas." I say correcting her because he is my boyfriend, the least she can do is call him by his name."Mary, did anyone ask you?" Marlene asks I think trying to distract us before Dorcas and I start having a full-blown argument."No, unfortunately, the only person who I think would ask me is Reginald Cattermole from Hufflepuff, but the marauders didn't invite him for good reason." Mary says, not looking Marlene in the eye, I think sad or embarrassed. She sounds almost as sad as Alice."Don't worry Mary, I am sure many people aren't going to have dates. Besides me and you can go together since we are both going alone." Alice says smiling at Mary and her voice comforting.It is at that moment that Potter comes running into the great hall alone. He takes a seat away from us for once. Which is weird, but a nice change. I think I am the only one who has noticed him.I turn back to the girls who are discussing what they are going to be wearing for the party.I should add here that I am a guy who has zero fashion sense and who just wears whatever is comfortable. So if I purposefully leave the fashion conversation and what they are going to wear to a minimum that is why. However, when the Yule Ball comes I will give a full description for that.Marlene says "I know the perfect combination that I am going to wear. It is going to blow Caderacs mind."Mary says "Do you mind if I borrow your purple shirt, Marlene, it would go great with the skirt I am planning to wear."Marlene says "Sure, I really don't mind. Just make sure not to damage it!" She did sound dead serious at the end giving Mary a partial glare. I know this is just cause Marlene loves her clothes. I look over and see Potter is already leaving the Great hall, that was quick.I turn to focus my attention back to the conversation at hand. They continue to talk about what they are going to wear until the end of breakfast. We head back to the dorm and begin to work on some of our homework. We would be out all night so we may as well get it done now.Timeskip to Lily's Alchemy classI head to my Alchemy class and take my seat next to Thomas. The professor isn't here yet. I turn to face Thomas, to see if he wants to talk but he is reading, so instead, I open up my book and do the same. Suddenly out of nowhere, I hear a voice say "I still can't believe you're making me go tonight. Parties are not my thing, I would rather be in the library or somewhere quiet." Thomas says looking straight at me. I thought we went through this last night."Thomas, we talked about this, it is one night, one night to spent time with our friends, dancing and enjoying ourselves. It is going to be fun." I say picturing it in my mind, Thomas and I dancing next to Marlene, Mary, Alice, and Dorcas. I can't help but start shaking a bit with anticipation. It is like Dorcas said, whether you like it or not the Marauders parties are legendary.Thomas fully turns to face me and says "It might be fun, but it might also be loud, drunk students packed in an extremely small room. I mean do you know anything besides the broom cupboard next to the tapestry of Barnaby the Barmy?" I honestly don't but it is probably a secret room, however, I vaguely remember other parties being thrown in that general area, although I can never remember the room. It is always a marauder letting people in."Thomas, they probably just know a secret room there, I remember vaguely other parties being thrown in a room there. I just don't remember the room exactly. Marauder's parties are always fun, and there is always enough room, food and they always offer non-alcoholic beverages." I say rolling my eyes slightly because he is being a little difficult right now. It is not like I ask him to go to parties every week I asked him to go this once. Plus, I am pretty sure the only reason the Marauders invited him was that he is dating me. So, it would look rude on my part if Thomas didn't go."Fine, if you want to go we will go, but I am telling you we would have had a better time just the two of us in the library or the astronomy tower." He finishes before turning back to his book. I clench my book tightly to avoid retorting out of anger because the last thing I need to do is to shout at him out of anger and to have him change his mind. Instead of doing that I turn my attention back to my book and wait for the teacher to show up.Timeskip to the end of the lessonJust as I suspected this lesson was so fucking boring, just like the last one. Who was right about this guy being an absolutely boring professor, me. He gave us another essay on another important figure in Alchemy. I want to learn helpful or real information about the subject. This class is becoming the history of Alchemy instead of intro to alchemy. I may just have to read ahead, instead of waiting for this guy to actually teach us. At the end of class, I rush to the common room hoping to find my friends. I find most of them, at least the ones who aren't in class sitting around the fire again. I approach them and yell "I was right about Alchemy, the professor was exactly the same."After that I throw my bag down and begin to dance excitedly, I just love being right. "Wow Lily, nice dancing." Marlene says in a teasing voice, with a grin on her face.I don't care I was right, and she can't take that away from me. I continue to dance until Dorcas asks "Are you really about to judge a teacher by two classes?"I stop in my tracks, damn Dorcas, she just has to have flawless logic. But no I was right, he was just as boring as the first time. "He was just as boring as the last time, the same teaching method, the same format for Homework. The class may as well be called history of Alchemy." I explain proudly, take that Dorcas's logic."Yes, Lily you are probably right about the teacher." Alice says, yes Alice agrees with me, I was so right. "But maybe you should at least wait a month before declaring whether he is a bad teacher or not." Alice finishes. I deflate a little. Alice is usually right. I should give the teacher at least a month.Marlene is still laughing at my dance, which makes me laugh because I don't think my dancing was that bad."Marls there was no way my dancing was that bad." I say, looking her dead in the eyes trying to be serious and not burst into a fit of giggles."Lils, if I was able to record your dance and show it to you, you would understand." She explains while continuing to laugh.I look over at Dorcas and Alice and ask "What do you guys think? There is no way my dancing is that funny!"Dorcas and Alice who both had grins the entire time suddenly, burst into fits of giggles. I took that as my answer and started to laugh as well, it was ridiculous.Once we stop laughing Dorcas says "Lily, I think the fact that you have a victory dance for being right says it all." I don't think that it is a real problem, I mean I like to be right sue me."Yeah Lils, I love you but you have an obsession with being right." Alice adds laughing a little bit as she said it."I mean you literally hurried back from class just to say you are right." Marlene finishes, but I don't care, I was right, and I am going to let people know."You might be right Marls, but I don't care. When I am right I want people to know. And when you are right as often as I am, you tend to develop certain habits." I say cheekily, grinning in Marlene's direction.She just rolls her eyes at me before shifting the conversation elsewhere.Timeskip to the DinnerOnce Mary returns from class, we hurry downstairs to get an early dinner to give us enough time to eat and then get dressed for the party.When we get to the great hall, Marlene is looking around, I think for Caderac until she asks "has anyone seen any of the Marauders today I don't think I have seen them once?"Alice says "They probably spent the day celebrating Peter's birthday and setting up the party." She is right I think, although I again wonder if I should mention what I saw last night, but again, for some reason I decide against it.Instead, I say "I saw Potter at breakfast, he rushed in grabbed a couple of pieces of toast before running right back out I say." I look at Marlene and she seems a little calmer, her posture relaxes and she unclenches her fist."Is it me, or does the food suspiciously look like all of Peter's favorites." Mary asks, surprising me because I didn't think she knew that much about Peter.She then adds "We spent time together while the rest of you are in class." Okay, that makes much more sense."Well, I noticed the same thing at breakfast." I say, remembering the dishes I saw at breakfast."Yeah, they probably went to the kitchens and talked the house-elves into doing it." Dorcas adds straight-forwardly."They are about the only students who would befriend every single house-elf in the school." Marlene says laughing causing the rest of us to laugh. "They have probably befriended at least one of each species in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade." This causes us to laugh further imagining the marauders walking into the forbidden forest to see a centaur. Or going to the bottom of the lake to have a picnic with the giant squid.Timeskip to going to the party. The five of us dressed in stylish but comfortable manners, walk down the stairs where Marlene meets her date Caderac. He looks good, dressed up slightly, but like us still in a comfortable manner. The only issue is Frank is standing there holding hands with Shirley, I look over and see Alice looking in any direction but there. She has small tears at the edge of her eyes but she quickly looks away.We leave the common room and find Lawson and Thomas waiting for me and Dorcas. They dressed similarly to Caderac, we take each of their arms before heading to the location of the party, before we can even knock at the designated location, doors open revealing a large open room. Hanging from the ceiling is what looks to be streamers and magical fairy lights. There is a large stage upfront and a large open space for dancing. There seem to be tables set up along the ends with drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. There also seem to be tables littered with different types of food and a big chocolate cake that reads happy birthday Peter. There is a radio blasting music and a group of people already dancing. Finally, there is a group of chairs and couches if people want to rest and sit down. Potter who was the one to open the door says "Welcome to the party, I think you can tell what is what, Peter is set to get here in five minutes, we are going to quickly sing him a happy birthday, but other than that you guys are on your own do what you want." I notice him take a long drink of what I can only assume is alcohol."Wow, this is amazing." Lawson says, who has never actually been to a Marauders party before.Potter claps him on the shoulder and says "thanks chap, glad you like it, it took a while to prepare."Frank leads Potter away and they seem to have a quick conversation before returning to us, with Frank looking surprised but pleased. I wonder what it is about. I look over at Thomas and say "Didn't I tell you this would be awesome, I mean look around." It is truly beautiful, I have no idea where they came up with the idea but I absolutely love it."You were definitely right Lily. Thanks for making me come." He says giving me a quick kiss on the lips. I smile happy that Thomas is finally smiling and enjoying himself.I look over and see Sirius pouring himself a rather large glass of alcohol and ask "Potter, what happens if someone has had too much to drink? How are you going to make sure everyone makes it back to the common room?" I am worried because someone drunk might find it difficult to make it back to their common room.Potter who so far has been looking in my direction as little as possible, which I wonder about but choose to ignore says rather sharply "Don't worry we have designated people from each house who have promised to refrain from drinking too much and will escort people back to their room at the end of the party. Alice and I have already agreed to it for Gryffindor. And don't worry what I am drinking is small and won't have much effect. From Ravenclaw, Tessa and Sophie have agreed to it pointing to two girls in the mix of a conversation with a couple of other boys. From Hufflepuff, Ruby and Holly have agreed to do it pointing to two girls comfortably sitting in chairs. Finally, from Slytherin Alexander and Garrett have agreed to do it pointing to two tall, muscular boys."I am a little shocked by the treatment because for some reason he's mad or doesn't really want to be near me right now.He then continues "Now why don't you guys go in and get ready Peter'll be here soon."We all nod our heads and wander further into the party. Only a couple of minutes later Peter shows up and everyone at the party starts to sing happy birthday. Peter thanks everyone, they cut the cake and everyone eats. After a few chaste conversations and a few drinks, Thomas and I find ourselves dancing on the edge of the dance floor, Dorcas next to us. However, I can't help but notice in the center is Potter dancing with what seems to be all the girls who didn't have dates. I can see him twirling Alice around, putting a huge grin on Alice's face. Soon enough he is dancing with Ruby, then Lucinda. It didn't matter who he was dancing with they were always in the center calling for your attention. It didn't have anything to do with drinks or him trying super hard it was just his general magnetism. Soon enough, he was twirling Peter around causing everyone to laugh. He along with Sirius, Marlene, and Peter are the life of the party making sure that everyone was having fun and enjoying themselves. It just made the day that much more special. I suddenly see Sirius disappear with whoever his date was this year, Marlene following soon after. Instead of letting the party falter, Potter drags Dorcas on stage and summons a guitar, and begins playing a popular wizarding tune. He and Dorcas sing the lyrics causing everyone to jump up and down, raising the energy levels of the party to a new high. At around 11 some of the more studious students start to head back and I can see Potter was right about the chauffeurs. I spend the night dancing, talking, and just enjoying myself with Thomas and my friends. Thomas and I start to head out. I see Alice having a conversation with Potter so I wave goodbye.James POVLily and her boyfriend leave as I am talking to Alice. Man, it was a hard night. I mean I am trying to move on from Lily, but I definitely still have feelings. It was not fun watching her with her boyfriend all night. Specifically when the first thing she does is to question whether we are looking out for everyone's safety as if we are just going to let a bunch of people wander Hogwarts drunk. It's a low bar she has set for us."You still have feelings for her." Alice says, looking me in the eyes with an eyebrow raised as if daring me to say otherwise. Of course. Alice knows, she knows me as well as everyone, but this is not a topic I wanted to go into tonight. Especially because all I want to do is move on from her."How'd you know?" I ask, really curious if it was that obvious."You were trying to avoid them all night, the same thing I was doing with Frank." She says giving me a sympathetic look."What a pair we are. I mean even Mary and Peter danced with the people they liked tonight. And well Marlene and Sirius did a little more than talk." I say pointing out how we failed compared to the rest of our friends.She laughs and says "Right you are. How bout if we are both 40 and single, you and I get married."I laugh and reply "Sure why not, I think we would make a great pair."She nudges me and says "You're awesome, I am awesome so of course, we would."I look over at her and see her still grinning and I grin back. Even though some parts of this night weren't ideal, I still got to spend the night having fun with my best friends. And most importantly Peter was happy. So instead of complaining and feeling sorry for myself, I grab Alice's hand, and still smiling I lead her onto the dance floor to enjoy the final moments of the night.Many of you may find this chapter boring, but I think within it you find important observations about the characters and clues into what happens later on in this book. This chapter also was crucial in showing Lily's dynamic with her friends. I think I already showed the Marauders group, but this one showed Lily's group's dynamic. I also think it is important to represent Peter because he is a marauder and their friend. Finally, Alice and James in this chapter are goals. Now like always please comment, and offer feedback.

(Sept. 11-12, 1976)James POVThe weekend is here, it is time to start quidditch training. I head down to the pitch just before the sun rises at around 4:00 am, I told my team to meet me at the pitch at 6:00 am. That gives me ample time to run my workout before everyone gets here. I know the team is going to be cursing and complaining, but it will make a serious impact when the season comes. Plus, I have got this whole thing planned. Granted the team is going to be training 3, 4 hours, today alone, but they will thank me when the time comes. I do my usual routine and then begin to set up. I make sure all the balls are here, I check the order of my boards to show the group our strategies and formations for the season. Finally, I add the schedule which has our schedule for future sessions. We do still need a beater but tryouts can wait. I am thinking of having tryouts two weeks from now but I need to check with the team and Minnie. I also need to ask the team if they want to have a full house try out for backups and replacements. Last year our replacements graduated so if one of us isn't able to play we will be in serious trouble. It is better to have a person lined up and who knows our plays rather than scrambling. As I am setting up the first person to show up is Randall Wood, the person who I think will replace me as Captain when I leave. He is about 15 minutes early and proceeds to get changed without even a hello. I'm pretty sure he is still fast asleep.After changing he faces me and says while yawning "Hey cap, great to see you, can't wait to get started." This really doesn't surprise me, Wood is always punctual, respectful, and rather quiet. Much quieter than the rest of the team. The biggest issue I had with him last year was that he never spoke his mind. Which was a problem because he was able to see the pitch better than most people of his age. However, as the season got longer he spoke up more and more which really benefited the team."Great to see you back and as punctual as always. You are putting the other teammates to shame." I say knowing he is better with positive reinforcements."Well, you are the guy who has been down here for who knows how long. Besides, it is better to be early than late. And last year, these sessions were really helpful so there was no way I was going to miss it." He says enthusiastically with a smile on his face. The guy really doesn't have a fault and has the makings of a star. He always is on the quidditch pitch when he gets the chance and always takes things seriously.Suddenly, two people enter the room, and one of them shouts "Bloody hell James, why the fuck did we have to get up so early, surely we could've started at seven or eight. Are you trying to fucking leave us with no sleep?" I know immediately it is Marlene who shouted this. It is never a good idea to ruin her sleep but I don't really care. I can hear Dorcas who is laughing beside Marlene clearly enjoying the situation."Marlene, you can curse all you want, but not in front of the younger teammates." Dorcas scolds, always the one being proper."I am not a child. This is my second year on the team, I am not even a rookie. It is my second year on the team." Wood shouts clearly trying to sound mature. In reality, everyone on the team treats him like a baby because he is the youngest."Wood, the rule is on the list." I say pointing to the list of rules and regulations. See we have this list of rules and regulations that we make every year, adding to it throughout the season. Since wood didn't like to curse and he was in the third year, Frank added don't swear in front of wood to the list. There are also things like Don't wake up Marlene if she is napping. Don't piss me off, or I'll make you do extra laps. Or don't anger Dorcas or she'll hex you. Last year's list is still up, so it still technically applies."But that was last year's list and I am a year older." Wood complains clearly hoping not to be treated as the baby anymore."Whatever you say Wood, you are still the youngest." Dorcas says ruffling his hair just to anger him a little more. We all have a good team relationship, so I am not worried about a little teasing. Marlene who was clearly getting changed, storms back to the main room and is still grumbling about how I am being completely ridiculous making everyone wake up this early."Morning Motherfuckers." Mason calls, who despite the early hour seems wide awake. In all fairness, he is always awake. He never stops moving and is never tired."Mason remember the rules." Dorcas calls, clearly mentioning the same rule as before."Oh my bad, I forgot not to swear in front of Itty bitty Wood. How's our wittle baby brother?" He says walking over to Wood. Wood proceeds to tackle him to the ground and the two of them begin to play fight with one and another.Marlene who during this whole exchange was trying to take a nap I think, becomes disturbed by the noise. She starts shouting "WILL YOU SHUT UP SOME OF US ARE TRYING TO SLEEP." Both boys begin to pale and quickly mutter an apology.The last to arrive is Frank who is humming a cheerful tune. He greets everyone with a wide grin, and he is bold enough to walk over to Marlene and nudge her awake. He gets changed quickly and it is now time to begin our workout. I take them on a run around the Forbidden Forest making them sing an outrageously terrible song."Hey Marlene pick up the pace, I know you're faster than that. 2 laps around the quidditch pitch for whoever comes in last. COME ON FASTER GUYS." I shout trying to push them to run faster. We arrive at the pitch and I check my watch to see everyone's time. I walk over to the list of times each person ran last year at the beginning of the year. There seems to be an improvement in everyone's time so I decide against punishing anyone with extra laps.I say "Great job guys you all did better than you did last year, which is great. Now I want to go into the formations and strategies we're going to be using this year. After that, we are going to bring the balls out and head to the pitch."I hear a groan from both Marlene and then Mason, who even after the run is bouncing up and down on his feet. The rest seem to be satisfied or at least interested in what I have planned. I lead them back into the central room of our change room. I lead them through the various formations and tactics I plan to use this season. We talk it through as a group making various adjustments. After an hour of discussing plays and tactics, we have about an hour left in the session. So, I tell the team it is time to mount our brooms. I mount my Nimbus 900 after releasing the balls and the practice begins. The chasers attack the keeper, working through the formations we just went over. The beater is trying to hit us with bludgers while the seeker is trying to catch the snitch. After an hour of training, we finish up and put the balls back in their cases. We laugh and joke until I show them their schedule."So every Saturday, Tuesday, and Thursday we will be holding training. Two weeks from today I want to hold tryouts. Now, do you want to do a whole house tryout looking for a beater and the replacements in case someone gets injured or just a beater? I ask because really it is up to them."I think it might be better to have tryouts for both a beater and the replacements as it would be better for them to know our moves." Wood says, surprising me a bit that he was willing to speak up but glad he isn't returning to his old ways."Yeah Woods right, better be prepared than unprepared." Frank adds."Is anyone oppose?" I ask the group."Since no one is opposed then that's what we will do. Now we're done you are free until Tuesday. I will ask Minnie next time we see her about tryouts, does that sound good." I finish and watch as everyone but Marlene and Dorcas quickly file out. They wait as I clean up the last of everything before we walk back to the castle."Are you going to go grab breakfast or head to bed?" Dorcas asks Marlene and me. I will probably grab breakfast I am hungry and I can never sleep after Quidditch.Marlene clearly has other ideas as she says "I am going to head to bed since this monster made me wake up before 9 am." I roll my eyes, she has complained enough, and she will thank me when the extra training helps us win the cup."I am going to breakfast if you want to join." I say to Dorcas.She shrugs and says "sure."We head to the great hall.Time skip to after breakfastWe make our way back to the common room where we find Sirius and the rest of the marauders sitting doing homework."Prongs please don't tell me you were torturing your quidditch team for this long. I mean when I saw Marlene grumbling about a crazy person, I was hoping it wasn't you." Padfoot says while giving a look that says I am crazy."Please Padfoot, you know as well as I do, that I don't lose when it comes to quidditch so how about you don't question my methods. You know I am an amazing captain." I reply because my methods work and were proven last year when we went undefeated on our way to the cup.He rolls his eyes at me along with the other Marauders "I see that your confidence certainly hasn't lessened over the summer." Remus adds."Or your enthusiasm." Peter finishes, it's like everyone doesn't want to win or something. To win we need to put in the effort."Hey Wormtail, Hey Moony, just wait till after the season then you won't be so negative." I say back."How about you spend a fraction of the time you spent on Quidditch on your Homework. I mean you still have charms, DADA, and potions which is due on Monday and Tuesday." Remus says, always making sure we do our homework. I groan but go upstairs and grab my potions and charms work. I should get it done today. So that is how I spend the next couple of hours scribbling away on my homework occasionally asking Moony for some help.Timeskip to DinnerSo at dinner in the Great Hall, we sit down as a group, the nine of us together for the first time today."Today has been so boring, we haven't even done anything." Padfoot whines, always wanting to be apart of something exciting.Evans seems to roll her eyes at that and says "Sirius, you don't need to prank or throw a party every weekend.""That's where you are wrong Evans, we need to do something, otherwise the energy builds up, and then we explode." Padfoot replies whining so much that Remus decides to put him out of his misery."Don't worry Padfoot, we will come up with something to do tonight that'll make things interesting." Remus says rolling his eyes, hoping to calm Padfoot down.Seeming satisfied he returns to wolfing down his food as quickly as possible."Wow Sirius, you really have the attention span and behavior of a dog." Marlene says looking at him in disgust. Unknowingly she had just made a hilarious joke causing all us Marauders to laugh.All the girls look at us confused. "Why are you guys laughing?" Mary asks sounding completely confused."Inside joke don't worry about it." I say casually since I know Lily is already too curious about our comings and goings.They shrugged and went back to eating."Besides Marls you already know that you love me." Sirius adds winking. Marlene rolls her eyes at him."Since when, I'll have you know I have slightly better standards than you." Marlene jokes."You have standards. What is it, male mildly good-looking, because the number of guys who have matched your standards can fill most of this table? Sirius says joking as well.Marlene faked gasps pretending to be mad before bursting into laughter "Sirius Black are you really going at me about standards. When your standards are literally just human and breathing."Sirius rolls his eyes and asks with a raised eyebrow "You are forgetting to add attractive to that list. Only the best of the best can get with me. And please tell me how I don't match your standards?""Well for one, your hair isn't good enough, two you don't look good enough, three your flirtation skills suck. So I would say you definitely aren't up to my standards." She replies looking Sirius up and down with a fake disgusted look. It is a lie because everyone knows Sirius is a flirt, a good one, rather handsome, and perfect hair."HOW DARE YOU? HOW DARE YOU? I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW MY HAIR IS PERFECT! PRONGS ARE YOU HEARING THIS SHE INSULTED MY HAIR! BACK ME UP PRONGS." Padfoot shouts. I am trying to hold in my laughter because Padfoot is overreacting although everyone knows not to insult Padfoot's hair.Marlene just starts laughing and continuing to laugh. But Padfoot isn't done "And I will have you know that you definitely don't meet my standards. Not good-looking enough. Not to mention the way you dress is trashy?" Now, this is Marlene's weak point, everyone knows not to insult her fashion."OH YOU ARE SO GOING DOWN BLACK, YOU KNOW MY FASHION IS FLAWLESS. LILY TELL HIM MY FASHION IS FLAWLESS!" Marlene shouts at Sirius.At this point, all of us are laughing because this is just hilarious seeing Padfoot and Marlene riling each other up. I don't know why, but it is funny. We all know deep down they are joking with each other.Marlene looks at Sirius and says pretending to be serious "Well, I am just going to go elsewhere where my fashion is acceptable. Maybe Caderac likes what I wear." As she gets up she gives a wink to Sirius.Padfoot matching her gets up and says "While I will go find Reagan and see if she likes my hair."The two of them burst out laughing before sitting back down. They are so similar that it is kinda scary.Timeskip to after DinnerWe get back to the common room, Padfoot tells us he wants to go exploring or to play a game. I exchange a look with Remus, when Padfoot is this excited it is never good. Moony then says "Padfoot we know we have to work on that project tonight, and we have some leftover firewhiskey upstairs.""We have leftover firewhiskey, I am all in." Sirius says running up the stairs.Hopefully, the firewhiskey will calm him down because right now he is seriously energetic. We get upstairs and find Sirius already drinking a cup of Firewhiskey. We play games of wizard chess, gobstones, and exploding snap to pass the time. Sirius and Peter drinking Firewhiskey, while Remus and I work on the dreamless sleep potion, hoping to have it done after this weekend. All that is left is for the potion to simmer. So we look at the other two who aren't two drunk and ask do you guys want to explore the castle. Being the board students that we are, we decide to go explore the castle. The 9th floor is the floor we've spent the least amount of time on, so we go casting various spells to see if we can find a new passage or to just find a new secret room. We have been doing this for years, and over the years we have a system now that usually works for finding hidden secrets."Moony, Prongs I think I found something." Padfoot calls way too loudly. He is running over to get us along with Wormtail until they crash into a suit of armor. We know we are screwed now as we can hear Filch's footsteps running this way."Padfoot, are you fucking serious right now." Moony shouts angrily, I mean it was a rookie move from him.But we definitely underestimated how drunk Sirius really was because he replies "How can I fuck myself." Stopping in his tracks as if to think about it."This is really not the time." I say running back to grab Padfoot and drag him with us.Moony who is checking the map says "He'll be here soon, take the short cut behind the picture and we should be able to beat him back to the common room." After taking the short cut we make our way back to the common room without getting in trouble. We head back to our room. While we were walking Remus smacks Padfoot on the back of the head, just to let him know he is an idiot, which I can't help but agree."Did you guys really find a new passageway?" I ask unable to tone down my curiosity.Moony joins with the map and says to Wormtail "point it out on the map." Wormtail points to a part of the map that must have been a new secret passage since it wasn't on there. Moony and I exchange a nod and we begin to plan our next excursion which would mean visiting this location.Lily's POVI head down to breakfast as usual joining everyone but Marlene since she doesn't like to get up early and is still tired from yesterday. I don't have a lot to do today but my charms essay. It really won't be that difficult because it is my best subject along with Potions. The topic itself is pretty interesting, we need to talk about how casting charms non-verbally change the process. It isn't that big of a deal except it takes mental focus to perfect the spell. I still find it fun to learn about the differences. It is a really interesting topic. I will write it in the library later today. As a group, we head outside after breakfast since Mary wanted a chance to draw the forbidden forest. I pull out my book for a little bit getting lost within the pages of the muggle book. I look up and find Potter, Sirius, Marlene, Dorcas, and Peter playing in the lake. Alice is playing with the flowers looking at the different varieties. She seems lost in thought. Her posture is thick and she isn't really looking at the flowers. She is just walking aimlessly like she doesn't care where she is. She is twitching and her fingers are fiddling with the flowers. She is biting on her lower lip. She has been like this every since Friday. I think I should go over and talk to her. She is really starting to worry me. She looks seriously anxious about something. Mary on the other hand is happily humming to herself while drawing a very detailed picture of me. I smile it is a very good likeness. The picture of me looks great."This is great Mary, I can't believe you managed to draw this so well." I say because truly the drawing was perfect."Glad you liked it lils, do you want the picture." Mary says offering it to me."Course I do, it would be perfect to put in the dorm room. You are such a good artist Mary. I love this." I say taking the picture carefully hoping not to damage it too much.I walk over to Alice "Hey Ali, are you okay, you seem to have been spacing out a lot more since Friday." Which was true, she seems to be thinking about a lot of things."I am fine Lily, I was just thinking about a couple of things and some conversations I had." Alice says brushing it off as usual. She isn't one to share her feelings or even acknowledge them. She is shifting her weight from one foot to another and her fingers haven't stop twitching which is telling me she is hiding something."Are you sure, this isn't about Frank is it?" I ask questioningly because it usually is a sore spot."No, it isn't about Frank, not everything is about him you know!" She snaps angrily. Turning to glare at me, her fingers stopping for the first time in days. Why is she so mad, why won't she just tell me?"Alice please, I am not trying to anger you or push you, I am just worried about you." I say while approaching her slowly. I hope she knows that she is currently worrying me."It is just my mom, she is sick right now and my dad's not too sure about it. If he loses her I am not sure what he is going to do. It would crush him." Alice says with tears finally forming in her eyes.Oh my god, her mom, Alice, and her mom are super close and it would crush her if she died. Her dad also works a fair bit to make sure their family gets by. It would kill him to lose her, and I am not sure he would recover afterward. I don't say anything since Alice isn't the best when it comes to sharing her feelings. Instead, I just hug her tightly and just hold her until she finally calms down a little bit."You know whatever happens you are going to have all of us behind you right." I say because I know every one of her friends will be there for her.She smiles weakly before saying "I know and thank you.""If anything and I mean anything needs to be done I can help." I tell her filling my voice with seriousness, and squeezing her to tell her that I mean everything I say.She nods and says "Just can you not tell the others yet, I just don't want to deal with a million questions right now.I nod telling her I understand.Timeskip to later that dayI am heading to the library. I just need a break right now. It is terrible, a good person like Alice's Mom gets ill and can't afford the treatment. Innocent people who don't have magical parents are being killed and injured and no one seems to do anything. Why does everything have to be so dark? Why does this world have to be so cruel? Good, Innocent people are dying, and yet no one wants to do anything. This is why I want to be a healer. I wasn't completely sure heading into this year, but I want to help people like Alice's mom. Help those who can't help themselves. I grab the books I am going to need to finish my charms homework. But I can't begin to read. All the sad and dark thoughts passing through my hands. I squeeze the books hard trying to control my rising frustration. Why? Why is everything so fucked up? I am sure my face is bright red right now with anger. I am slightly shaking, I just wish I could focus on more happy thoughts. I need to get this essay done, but surely there is something I can do. But how can I? I mean with every passing day more people think I don't belong in this world. I am starting to wonder if I don't. I mean if I didn't come to Hogwarts, my parents and my sister would still understand me. I could actually speak up about something without having someone calling me a mudblood. I could walk freely without looking over my shoulders. I could feel safe every day without worrying about an attack. I wouldn't worry about my parents or my family, or be concerned about an upcoming war. Why couldn't I just be normal? I could make such a difference. I slam the book on the table in frustration receiving a glare from Madame Pince. Oh, go away you horrible woman. Focus, you need to get this done, you need to become a healer so you can help people. Come on focus damn it. I start to write my essay but I really can't focus. But then someone pulls up a chair next to me."Hey Lily, how are things going?" Remus Lupin asks while looking at my work."Not great it seems." He continues taking out his own notes."I am fine, just having trouble focusing." I say, trying to push away his curiosity."Come on Lily, don't give me that. What seriously is troubling you?" He says in a voice filled with caring and concern."I just... Do you ever feel like you don't belong?" I ask, he is a werewolf so maybe he will understand."Yes sometimes, I mean the way people look and treat me when they find out who I really am, it makes me feel horrible like I am a monster. I know you know Lily. You are too smart not too." Remus says truthfully, I am surprised he knows this when really I shouldn't be surprised he always knows everything."Oh, I didn't say anything because I didn't want things to be awkward and I didn't want things to be different between us." I say, hoping he doesn't think I didn't mention it because I think he is a monster."I know Lily, I know you would never judge me, but we were talking about you. Are you feeling like you don't belong?" Remus asks turning the conversation back to me."Yes, I mean all those Purebloods want me dead and it is becoming increasingly dangerous to be a muggleborn even just at school. There are so many people who want to see me dead. I want to stop feeling scared. To be able to do something without being called a mudblood. I wish sometimes I didn't have magic." I say avoiding his eyes, feeling ashamed of my weakness."Lily, you are forgetting the most important part of the journey. Your friends. Are you telling me, meeting Marlene, Alice, Mary, and Dorcas isn't worth all the abuse?" Remus asks."They are definitely worth it but sometimes especially with Marlene, Alice, and Dorcas that I am causing them more danger than anything else. I am making them blood traitors, aren't I?" I say, because without me Marlene, Alice, and Dorcas wouldn't be at a risk. They wouldn't be targets. They wouldn't align with the Purebloods but surely they wouldn't be looking to fight after school."You can't think like that Lily. I know if you spoke to them they don't and would never change anything. They care about you Lily. Trust me I know how you feel, I have felt like that every single day for years. But guess what, every time I feel that way, James, Sirius, and Peter, remind me just how important I am to them. Lily, you belong here, you have made friends here and you shouldn't regret it." Remus says looking me in the eyes with a ferocious and desperate look.I think about all he says and it is helpful. I trust Remus and I am calmer, but I can't help but disagree. I still think my friends would be better off without me. I want to make a difference but I don't think I can as a muggleborn. But maybe, all I can do is fight. I try to shake off all the horrible thoughts. I turn to Remus who is still giving me this hard look as if he wants me desperately to understand how important I am.I turn to face him and in an attempt to placate him say "I know I don't regret the friends I made, I really wouldn't trade them for the world. Most importantly I wouldn't trade you. You're my brother Remus and my best friend. I wouldn't give you up for everything."He nods, his body relaxing and a small smile forming on his face, and says "Now let's get this charms homework done."Okay, so another chapter is done, although again you might find it boring but I find this is an important chapter. It shows Lily's mental state and how quickly she can spiral with a single negative thought. I think it also highlights Remus and Lily's friendship which has currently been lacking in this book. Also, it starts the quidditch season and I wanted to show how a team dynamic really works because I really know what it feels like to be on a team and how close of a bound you can really form. It is also an introduction to a further quidditch storyline which will start soon. I also was able to add small hints of Blackinnon if you read the story. As always please vote, and offer feedback.

Harry really hated the sea.He hated its smell, he hated its seeming endlessness, he hated its boring, bland uniformity, and he especially hated its ever-so nauseating sway.The cell was appalling. He could barely make out the minuscule droplets of water dripping steadily from the rotting, creaking boards of the ceiling. The putrid smell of mould and mildew was threatening only to further heighten his nausea.A sudden, sharp jolt of the ship brought him back to his senses.He was a prisoner, wandless, on a ship going who-knows-where, overseen by an obnoxious rabble of muggle military men speaking a language he didn't understand, and trapped with seemingly no chance of avoiding his unpleasant fate.Perhaps, in retrospect, undertaking a mission to the continent at this time was a guarantee that he would land himself in trouble—he was perfectly aware that the French wizards had been stirring up a bit of a fiasco with the muggles—and perhaps, in retrospect, it was a bit of a miscalculation to arrive in the Netherlands very obviously as a wizard without speaking the slightest word of Dutch. But still, go where he will, do what he must, spontaneous plans had always been his forte.It was quite a bit of a surprise, then, when he was surrounded by a cluster of drab grey and detained. He'd already been carted to and fro by rabbles of muggle military men for two months. His new beard was starting to scratch quite annoyingly, let alone the mess of blood and grime that matted the top of his head. He didn't really think of himself as a dandy, but the unbearable filth of his hair was only exacerbated by the extent of which he was forced to degrade himself.He had been starved, beaten, starved, beaten again, and unceasingly interrogated about the "esoteric secrets" of Revolutionary France. He didn't think he looked French, gave off any indication of being French, or displayed any of their infinite arrogance and disdain (perhaps he might have done), but his captors were assured of the fact that he was every bit as French as the now headless King of France's loafers.Perhaps it might have had to do with the fact that he only spoke English and French, and that he might have introduced himself in French to the soldiers at the Amsterdam port. Perhaps it might also have been because he was clearly magical, and perhaps, seeing as the French currently had the only statute-defying wizards in the world, the Dutch presumed that magic was inherently French. Perhaps he should have realized that the coalition soldiers would immediately arrest any person who spoke French. Granted, he didn't think he was that conspicuous. Yes, he was a bit distracted by his attempts at removing the pigeon excrement frustratingly stuck to his broom, but surely the soldiers patrolling the streets shouldn't have automatically assumed that a perfectly mundane-looking broomstick would be a clear indication of his magical nature.His explanations that no, he was certainly not French and no, he was certainly not here to spy—perhaps he was—but definitely not for the French had resulted only in increased beatings from his interrogators.The French magical community, in all their wisdom, had decided to overturn a century of established order from the Statute of Secrecy. Why that was, Harry wasn't exactly sure. Quite a few years had passed since that initial surprise, and he still didn't really understand.And he didn't want to understand. He couldn't really find any drive in him to sympathise. They found it boring that they couldn't go outside without mildly inconveniencing themselves by dressing as muggles, they found it boring that they couldn't use spells amongst muggles, they found it boring that they couldn't wear colourful robes: those were too obviously magical, and they found it boring as well they couldn't even wear expensive robes: those were also too obviously magical. Of course, they didn't understand that a bit of boredom was a fairly reasonable exchange for the security and survival of magical world.Nevertheless, feeling oppressed, they revolted.He wasn't ever supposed to be at all directly involved in this conflict. He was a nobleman's son, not a fighter, not a leader, and for Merlin's sake barely even a diplomat. It had absolutely nothing to do with him that a bunch of stuck-up wizards decided to overturn their perfectly prosperous century of stability. It made absolutely no sense whatsoever that they, the completely uninvolved magicals from the other side of the channel would need to shoulder so much of the responsibility of remedying this absurd fiasco.The ship lurched violently, abruptly becoming uncharacteristically silent. The swaying stopped; the musky air of his cell was eerily still. He basked in the silence.A flurry of enraged shouts suddenly resonated from the upper decks, penetrating the stillness. Harry blinked. He wasn't sure if his knowledge of the Dutch language was that out of touch, but he could have sworn that he'd heard the word "cavalry" in the midst of the chaos. He wouldn't think much of it anyway, there was not any doubt in his mind that there was some sort of attack taking place. If there was any correct time to attempt his escape, it would be now—even if he had to swim across the entire North Sea.He frantically began to scour his surroundings for any possible means of escape. It really was disgustingly rancid here. He scrunched his nose in disgust, continuing to scan the cell for anything at all that could be of help.A tiny glimmer of reflected lantern light caught his attention. He could probably just break his way out directly, the guards didn't seem to be posted near him anymore, he remarked, channelling his magic in his attempt at undoing the extremely muggle padlock clasped onto the entrance. It was quite funny, he never would have thought his seemingly redundant ability to do simple spells without his wand would actually come into a real, practical use. Then again, he never would have thought he would ever have been parted from his wand.The lock unclasped; the door creaked open. There wasn't a single indication of life in the corridor. His wand, however, was waiting for him somewhere in the ship. Attempting to minimise his presence, he carefully trod through the ship's narrow corridors in search of his beloved eleven inches of holly and phoenix feather, paying deliberate attention not to make the slightest noise.The air was piercingly cold, but Daphné felt none of it. She shouldn't have, after all, it was all her doing.The only thing she could really feel was triumph as she gleefully rode alongside the ranks of the Revolutionary Army into Den Helder. She would never have admitted it, but she was almost astonished that the Dutch campaign had managed to pass so smoothly.She brought her horse up to the colonel."Are the regiments in position? We won't have much time to spare after I cast the spell.""Don't be so hasty Mademoiselle Daphné," the colonel remarked, unnaturally calm, "Impatience is not befitting of a woman of your status."Refraining from formulating a response, she gritted her teeth, gnawing on the inside of her cheek. The air was already intoxicatingly rife with victory.The soft pats of the covered hooves were becoming all too grating. They were just a stone's throw away from victory, a tiny nudge towards being one step closer to achieving their ultimate goal. Soon, the Dutch wizarding community would be able to join their French compatriots in their open existence alongside the muggles.Daphné felt for the small locket tucked below her collar, softly smiling as she detected the textured bump. Her mother had taught her to be proud. She would never defer to any other person, and she would never think of herself as anything but perfect. The idea that she was forced to hide this perfection, this pride from the vast majority of the world had always greatly unsettled her. At Beauxbâtons, she could never understand just how all of her peers were content with sitting there, hidden from the greater world, hidden from attaining their full potentials.She scoffed. Her peers still could not understand how monumental these passing events were. When the Civil Constitution of the Clergy was passed, she rejoiced, proud to be free from a century of oppression, proud to be liberated from her restrictions. Most others, instead, used it as an opportunity to frolic about, creating unnecessary chaos that only served to be a detriment to their cause.Daphné wasn't one to complain, however. She just couldn't believe she was at the forefront of all this.The icy wind blew across her face. The satisfaction of her impending triumph was unbearably close. Each gallop of her horse, each shout from the officers served only to increasingly frustrate her. They had received word from the Dutch muggles that they had captured one of the French wizards. Daphne scoffed. How exactly they expected that would make them acquiesce was beyond her.A deep voice from behind drew her from her thoughts."Ready when you are, Mademoiselle." The colonel drew his horse to a stop.Her fingers tingled with anticipation; her trusty laurel wand unnaturally warm. Her horse, seemingly sensing her trepidation, halted at the shoreline.The bay was calm, tranquil, undisturbed by the turmoil ravaging the country, its waters nearly as still as ice. Daphné scowled at that thought, nearly was not going to be in any way enough. She shut her eyes, feeling the familiar sensation of her magic in her wand. Tendrils of white mist began to slowly manifest from her wand, penetrating the chilly air in coiled spirals. The unreserved commotion of the battalions suddenly ceased, blanketing the entire area with a suffocating silence.She opened her eyes to observe her success. A deafening crack resounded across the bay, disrupting the silence. The calm, tranquil waters seemed to freeze in place, bringing the before waving masts in the distance to a standstill. It was all rather peaceful, serene even.Pandemonium erupted in an instant in the otherwise quiet port. Waves of cavalrymen rushed into formation, storming across the newly formed ice with apparent ease. Daphné let out a breath of relief. Her spell had worked considerably better than she'd expected.She sighed, bringing her horse forward into the ranks. She still had an obligation—to rescue some incompetent cretin from some nefarious situation brought about by their own wrongdoing. Really, could it have been that difficult not to be captured by muggles?Her trusted steed steadily traversed the ice, conspicuously clopping its hooves across the frozen surface. The frosted peaks of the warships' masts began to shimmer into view, the details becoming finer as she gradually broke through the murky haze.The Admiraal Piet Heyn was majestic, or it would have been if it were not for the near total darkness of the winter night. It was beautiful nonetheless, Daphné thought, observing the moonlight's shimmer off the frosted hull. She disembarked from her horse, taking heed on the slippery surface. She calmed, the air around her blurring as she gracefully ascended the upper decks of the ship, softly touching down onto the frigid planks of the top deck.She hesitated, carefully descending into the lower decks. Head high, she briskly made her way towards the stern of the ship in search of any clues to aid her search. The door was ornate, Daphné remarked, tastelessly exuberant.Drawing her wand into her hand, she summoned her magic, the door steadily creaking open. She stared, gaping at the mop of horridly messy hair before her, the owner's horridly uneven complexion and more importantly—what was surely a wand that he seemed to be clutching.Her nostrils flared with indignation."Just who exactly are you supposed to be?"Harry couldn't believe his luck.He had managed to sneak through the entirety of the ship without being noticed by any of his muggle captors. It really was a fluke of luck, save the fact that his wand was nowhere to be found.The narrow corridors were becoming oppressive; the walls seemed to be pressing in on him, becoming closer and closer with each step he took. The ship was seemingly endless, each ladder leading to another, each corridor only serving as an extension of another. His nausea threatened to overwhelm him as he stumbled through the decaying planks in search for his wand. He hesitated momentarily and painfully hit a final, ornate door.The light reflecting off of the brass handle was almost blinding, the detailed images on the carvings threatened to jump out at him. Harry halted, momentarily deliberating. Shaking, he placed his hand on the cold metal, pushing open the door with surprising difficulty.It was obnoxiously swanky, in the centre of the back wall stood a portrait of a rather plump man with an oddly distinct chin. A meticulously carved desk was planted in the middle, with brass-handled drawers begging to be opened and searched. The walls were lined with shelving, its contents separating themselves from Harry with uncharacteristically luminous panes of glass.For quite some time, he rummaged through the room, searching through every nook in every drawer of the desk, his frustration only increasing as he continued to no prevail.He took an upwards glance at the clock fixed on the wall. It struck midnight, the shouts from outside only increasing in volume. There—behind the glass—in the shelving, a familiar rod of holly was inconspicuously resting, further enticing him to reach forward and grab it, to relieve his frustration.The transparent pane swung out before him, lightly creaking on its hinge. His arm extended; his hand outstretched, relaxing as he closed onto the familiar warmth.A familiar grinding noise sounded from behind, forcing him to knock his knees against the unnecessarily sharp edge of the desk in his surprise. A decidedly feminine voice filled the room."Just who exactly are you supposed to be?" A strong smell of lavenders penetrated his nose.His wand flew out of his hand. Alarmed, he sharply turned around, again colliding with the edge of the desk.A sudden cold burst caused him to shiver. An immaculately dressed woman stood before him, twirling his holly wand in her hand. She looked young, about the same age as him, but carried herself with significantly more maturity. Her expression seemed to exude confidence, her refined symmetry radiating a sense of condescension.His limbs froze into place, and he collapsed onto the hard planks."It would be rather nice if you answered my question." The woman demanded annoyedly, stepping towards him. His wand continued to weave in between her fingers.Harry faltered, putting his best effort into avoiding her piercing gaze. Her blue eyes were frighteningly bright."I said," the woman restated, now holding the wand tightly, pointing it at him, "Would you please answer my question?""Vernon Dudley.""Don't. Lie." She gritted through her teeth, eyes narrowing.Harry recoiled. "I'm Harry Potter, the muggles on this ship took me. Now, would you please return my wand and unbind me?""From where?""England. I was with the Ministry of Magic."She shut her eyes momentarily, sighing. "As strong as my desire is to never see you again, you're in all likelihood just a bit too valuable."She levitated him into the air, leading him through the now strangely liberating bowels of the ship and onto the top deck, unceremoniously dropping him onto the cold, hard surface."What use am I to you anyway?""You wouldn't understand.""I'm not moving an inch without an explanation.""You don't have a choice."He was again lifted into the air, slowly and steadily gliding towards the edge of the deck. The ice underneath was illuminated by the torchlight of the cavalrymen. He looked back at the woman, making out the outlines of her face in the dim light."Who are you?"Refraining from formulating an answer, she released her spell, unceremoniously dropping him onto the back of her horse.A/N: I had originally written this for a story competition on the DarkLordPotter forums, and meant to extend it into a more expansive AU. I guess this is the point where I'm finally getting around it.

Daphné was annoyed.Her time of triumph should have been… well… triumphant. Instead, she was advancing towards the general with this imbecile tied to the back of her horse."I've taken a prisoner." She descended from her horse, gesturing towards the haggard-looking man still conjoined to her steed.The general began to respond. "Surely you must have a better reason for…""He's a wizard." Daphné cut him off."And naturally, Mademoiselle Daphné, he would clearly be your responsibility, no?"She briskly turned on her heel and re-mounted her horse, releasing an exacerbated sigh, leading her steed towards the glazed beach, away from the commotion of the lingering soldiers."Nice to meet you too Mademoiselle Daphné." An obscenely grating voice rang from behind her.She scowled, disembarking onto the snow with a light crunch."Might as well get to know each other."Daphné pursed her lips, drawing her wand into her hand. A loud crack reverberated through the air, brusquely launching him through the ice and into the cold, salty depths.She released a long, drawn-out breath she didn't know she'd been holding. The water before her bubbled, giving way to an annoying familiar mop of black hair."You could just let me go, you know." He'd managed to climb back onto the bank, significantly shivering."That would be too logical, Potter." Daphné glanced down at the soaking man."It's cold.""Presumably so, yes.""Will you at least warm me up?""I can't."They rode with the army for quite some time, traversing the expansive, flat countryside. The landscape was entirely white, buried under a heavy layer of snow, its vast expanse becoming dreadfully suffocating."Why don't you use a broom?" Her prisoner had again decided to speak.Reminded of lavish excess of the wizards back home, she furrowed her brow, concentrating on following the procession in front of her. He really was grating. "Horses are… more refined, Potter. Not that you would know.""These ropes are awfully uncomfortable, you know."Daphné refrained from answering.Her prisoner had been unconscious for quite a stretch of time when the convoy eventually came to a halt at the edge of an almost picturesque village, completely devoid of life, vacated in light of the passing armies. The commotion soon erupted, a makeshift camp quickly erecting out of the previously barren field."We are not staying in one of those tents." Daphné descended from her horse, shooting a stinging hex at her prisoner, rousing him with a sharp jolt.A sluggish voice slurred in response. "Why not? They sound quite comfortable.""Because, crétin," Daphné retorted, leading her horse towards the village street, "One of us hasn't degraded themselves to spending months in a prison cell."With the sun slowly escaping, she soon brought them to a stop before a small cottage. The windows did not emit a single ray of light, its stone walls weathered by years of harsh winters."If you told me this was here I might not have been so reluctant." Her detainee was now freshly alert, restrained on the horse, with his back straightened."You shouldn't question me, Potter. It's for your own good. Get inside.Potter momentarily struggled on his bindings. "I think I might be having a bit of difficulty doing that."The cottage was quite nice by muggle standards, Daphné presumed. She almost felt bad for the muggle family that had abandoned it. There were beds with soft straw mattresses and scratchy linen sheets, a woodstove covered with a layer of grime from years of heavy use, a surprisingly gorgeous dark wood table, and mercifully, a large wooden bathtub. She lightly crinkled her nose but refrained from expressing her grievances. It was all remediable.With a light flick of her wand, the tub transformed, the rough, dark wood smoothing out into a brilliant white porcelain. A pool of water steadily rose to its rims, bubbling with soap suds."You," Daphné started, grimacing at her reluctant companion, "will be getting rid of that awful stench of yours."Harry was momentarily taken aback, but he didn't hesitate, immediately stripping off his torn and tattered rags, flinging them onto the layer of dust settled on the ground. The water sloshed as he lowered himself into the bath. He began to shiver; the water was disturbingly cold."It's freezing." He chattered through his teethDaphné spoke distractedly from the corner, transfiguring the scratchy linens into soft silk. "I can't exactly do anything to fix that."Harry groaned, stretching back onto the cold porcelain, immediately recoiling. He struggled for an instant to channel his magic, the warmth tingling in his fingers. He collapsed, drained, resigned towards the unbearably cold state of his bath.It was steaming when he passed out, exhausted.The water was still warm when Harry woke.He struggled to open his eyes, stuck together by a layer of discharge, making way to a soft candlelight. The windows were now pitch black, with his own weathered face reflected off of the lustrous glass. He reached for his face, finding it uncomfortably sore. It was uncharacteristically smooth; all traces of that horrid beard were vanished.He looked across the room at his companion, her blonde hair tied in a tidy plait, her blue eyes almost black in the tint. He paused to reflect on his situation, letting out a light, incredulous laugh. He'd been liberated from months of horrid mistreatment by his supposed allies and forced into the hands of an enemy who would, in all likelihood, remove his head cleanly off his shoulders.He wasn't sure which one he preferred.The bath was quite comfortable—no, scratch that—heavenly. He revelled in the warm, soapy water as he scraped the sedimentary layers of dirt and grime off of his skin. His muscles relaxed; his soreness temporarily relieved by the warmth of the water and the feeling of his now unblemished skin on the smooth porcelain of the tub.He continued to gaze at his captor, slightly mesmerised by the ripples in her gown, the intricacy of her plait, the slight furrow of her brow as she was paused in deliberation. He attempted to muster the strength to speak, the words struggling to escape his mouth."I'm stuck with you, aren't I?" His voice was raspy, the mucus trapping his speech."For the time being, yes." She spoke dismissively, sitting on the edge of the bed, toying with a silver locket in her hand, opening and closing it arbitrarily. It was quite beautiful reflected in the candlelight, the ornate carvings encapsulating the room with a pattern of stars.They sat there for quite some time, the bath eventually becoming lukewarm in the chilly room. Harry sighed, the temporary comfort had left, leaving nothing but his continually increasing sense of dread.Deciding not to remain domicile, he began to lift himself out of the tub, wincing as he exposed his aching muscles and sores to the chilly air. He gently placed a foot on the strangely lustred wood flooring, shrinking it away as he came into contact with the cold surface. Slightly mortified, he spoke."Euh… Mademoiselle…" Harry flushed slightly, stilted, "Would you mind, y'know, getting me a bit of clothing?"She gently turned her head towards him, immediately averting her eyes at the sight presented before her. Harry wasn't sure whether or not it was out of embarrassment or disgust. Slightly fumbling with her wand, she hastily conjured a laced linen shirt and breeches, banishing it in his general direction.Tripping over himself, he caught the freshly formed garments in his arms, hurriedly dressing, painfully suppressing the shivers that threatened to overwhelm him. Fully clothed, he made his way over to the second bed, collapsing onto the soft silk. It smelled familiarly of lavenders.His eyes were steadily fixated onto the dark, rough beams of the roof. His companion's delicate, drawn-out breaths resounded in the silence, puncturing the quiet, cool air in the cottage. He decided to interrupt this peace."Why do you do this? This entire mess—it's just so grating. Everything's gone to Merlin-knows-where, and there's no end in sight. I'm tired of it." He sat up, leaning against the wall.Daphné shut her eyes. "It's much more than that.""How would that be?"She pressed her lips together, staring blankly in front of her, deliberating. "Do you know why we fight? Do you know why I fight? I'm tired too, Potter. But no—I'm not tired of working for what I believe, I'm not tired of going out and protecting what I deserve. I'm tired of having to hide, I'm tired of having to swallow my dignity, I'm tired of having to relegate myself to the shadows just to placate some ignorant muggles.""It's not that. I just think it'd save us a lot of pain, it'd save everyone a lot of pain, if—Merlin I don't know—we just swallowed this dignity, stayed in the shadows, everything would be alright." Harry released a deep sigh into his hand."And then, what would be the point? We'd lose who we are, and in the end, that's all that matters, no?""I don't know, there has to be something else to it. It's just… awfully fatalistic putting it that way. I think we could base our identities somewhere else, you know, not somewhere so… impassioned, so dubious."Daphné pulled her sheets closer, sounding mildly upset. "It's never that simple, not that you'd understand. Good night, Potter.""Good night Mademoiselle. Perhaps…" He trailed off.She wasn't responding, already in a deep sleep.Relaxed, Harry allowed himself to fall back into his bedding. The strong lavender scent again overwhelmed him as he descended into the darkness. He found it strangely comforting.When Daphné opened her eyes, the sun had almost completely risen, its rays brilliantly shining through the clear glass windows of the cottage. A blinding beam of light viciously attacked her visage, endeavouring to remove her from the seeing world.She struggled to lift herself from her nest, softly groaning into her hand, attempting to shield herself from the dazzling sunlight. Minute specks of dust perforated through the air, accentuating themselves in the brightness.Her prisoner was already awake, back propped against the textured wall, seemingly deep in his thoughts. She ignored him.Groping for her wand, she conjured a small mirror and began to carefully preen the details of her visage, ascertaining to the impeccability of her maquillage. This continued for quite some time, with occasional groans sounding from her companion as his contemplation appeared to be beginning to get the better of him.Eventually, this peace was disturbed when the door unceremoniously swung open, making way to a rather squat soldier carrying a tray assorted with bread, cheese, and fruit."Your food." His gaze was fixed firmly on the ground, avoiding eye contact with the intimidating witch or her equally intimidating prisoner. He hurriedly dropped the tray onto the table, hastily exiting the room, closing the door with a slam.Potter snorted slightly. For the first time that morning, he spoke. "You're that intimidating?""Wouldn't you like to know?" Daphné scowled, allowing her magic to slip the grey Brunswick over her body."I don't think I've ever met anybody quite like you." He leaned on the edge of the table for support, toying with the crusty, somewhat stale bread. He starts to chew."I'm touched." She approached the tray, lightly nibbling on a piece of cheese, numb in her mouth.Daphné wasn't really sure what to think of her prisoner. For an enemy, he'd been surprisingly cooperative—if not obnoxious—and a bit naïve. She wasn't very sure what use he was yet herself, honestly. It might have been a better choice to let him free on the ship, but a nagging feeling remained inside of her, telling her that he was of some use.A slight rustle forced her to focus on the scene before her. Placing the slab of bread back onto the tray, Potter began to inquire. "How long will I be here?"She frowned. "Until I figure out what to do with you."For several minutes, they ate in silence, the soft chewing echoing through the undisturbed air.It wasn't so bad being Daphné's prisoner.It also wasn't so bad that she was quite easy on the eyes.Anything would have been a better alternative to those Dutch muggles, Harry presumed.Pleasant wafts of lavender crept their way into his nose as he sat at the back of Daphné's horse, the flat, white landscape seeming almost liberating. He delighted in the fresh air—after months without any access, it was intoxicating. He was a prisoner, a captive, travelling with an army at war with his own, but strangely he'd never felt freer. He felt less constricted than he'd ever been.It was a nice feeling, but it would have been much nicer to have his wand.A shorter horse strode up to their right flank, its rider carrying a scroll of textured parchment."Message for you, Mademoiselle." He was looking into the other direction as he clumsily handed over the scroll, quickly galloping away, disappearing into the blue sea of uniform.Harry watched from behind as she unwound the rough paper, lightly shaking her head."It looks like," she began with another small shake, "we'll be on our way."A sudden wave of fear rushed over Harry. "Where?""Amsterdam.""What will happen to me?" He was now extremely afraid."No idea."

Daphné wasn't sure who she disliked more—the French wizarding community, the Dutch wizarding community, or the—now admittedly—decently presented man seated behind her.The habitually bustling port city seemed a bit subdued. Scores of uniformed soldiers patrolled the streets, individual muggles seemed to be wandering around, carrying about their daily errands. The buildings were all pristine, neat, clean, and very obviously completely unaffected by the recent occupation. The only disturbance in the entire city seemed to be the light layer of snow blanketed of the streets and buildings.She was just confused.There was not a single indication of magic in her midst. She wasn't expecting the same overexuberance she'd become acclimated to back in France, but she was at least expecting the Dutch to have some reaction to their newfound freedom from the restrictions of the Statute.But there wasn't anything, and it didn't seem like there would be.Her companion spoke, his voice oddly restrained. "I never thought I'd be back here again.""A big surprise?""I just thought—I don't know—it would have looked a lot different from before with the passing armies and whatnot but—it's all the same." He shivered slightly."It is rather unsettling." Daphné grimaced at her surroundings.They slowly passed through the narrow streets, receiving odd stares from the passer-by as the horse rhythmically clopped its hooves on the smooth cobblestone. The steady brouhaha of the city streets seemed to falter in their presence, again picking up as they passed. The canals were frozen over (her doing, of course), speckled with hurried skaters rushing past each other in the commotion.There still wasn't the slightest hint of magic. As such a cultural and commercial centre, Daphné would have thought it to be the next bastion of freedom, a symbol for wizardkind, unrestrained from its shackles.But it didn't feel free.They drew to an abrupt halt before a formidable brick house. Several uniformed guards were posted in front, the bright blue of their coats harshly contrasting the dull red brick. Daphné stepped off onto the path, lightly clicking her heels on the stone.A guard spoke up, voice gruff. "The general will be waiting inside, Mademoiselle."The interior was beautiful, but all Harry could feel was dread.An intricate chandelier hung from the high ceiling, illuminating the hall and its elaborate furnishings, accentuating the deep shadows. A grand marble staircase stood at the centre, towering over him intimidatingly."Come." His companion's heels clicked on the smooth marble of the staircase.He attempted to follow, but his legs were immobile, seemingly weighed down by a block of ice. He struggled to keep up with her pace. Each step he took became increasingly difficult as if his body sensed the danger before him.He eventually reached the top, trembling, tracing Daphné's light steps through the corridor. He came to face with an elaborately carved wooden door, shaking in trepidation as she rhythmically tapped her knuckles on the hollow wood.The door opened, making way to a characteristically familiar room, brightened by a soft candlelight. The man appeared younger than he'd expected, his long, slightly greying hair giving away an indication of his age."The prisoner, mon général."The man was staring directly at him. "Thank you, Mademoiselle. You may leave us."Daphné gave a curt nod, turned, and promptly exited the room. The smell of lavenders failed to linger."General Jean-Charles Pichegru, pleased to make your acquaintance." His hand was outstretched.Harry reluctantly took the hand into his own, feebly shaking it."Harry Potter." The words barely registered out of his mouth."Seat yourself, Monsieur Potter. Do you play?"He nodded weakly, knees buckling, and he fell back, almost collapsing onto the plush velvet of the chair. A board lay on the desk, rather intricately decorated, its bright colours contrasted by the scatter of ominous skulls on its spiralled spaces."I was quite surprised when I received the missive that we had a foreign wizard in custody. All the way from Britain! Needless to say, I had to meet you."A pair of smooth wooden dice lightly turned in the general's hand, dropping onto the flat surface."I'm honoured." He tried to swallow, but his mouth felt awfully dry.The general picked up a metallic piece, moving it several spaces on the board. "Now, Monsieur Potter, would you be willing to enlighten me on how exactly you've landed yourself here.""I was arrested in Amsterdam for being a wizard." He could barely see the board in front of him, his vision hazy in his fear. The dice felt awfully cold in his hand, the wood digging into his skin, numbing it."And please tell, Monsieur Potter, what were you doing in Amsterdam? It's a turbulent time nowadays.""The war hadn't yet reached the city." The game piece was heavy, very troublesomely so."That does not answer my question."Harry's vision cleared and he sat up, straightening his back the best he could in his vertige, eyes tracing the general's hands. "I don't see why the affairs of wizards are in any way your concern.""But they are Monsieur Potter! This revolution was started by your brethren, and it's quite odd, is it not, that you seem to appear in the clutches of our enemy during our time of triumph?"He leaned closer to the desk, attempting not to falter before the general. "And tell me still, mon général, how exactly does this become your concern?""The revolution perpetuates for liberty Monsieur Potter, and I only serve to protect it."Harry sighed. If there was anybody that could save him at this stage, the general seemed to be his best bet, save Daphné perhaps. He fixed his gaze into Pichegru's beady black eyes, maintaining firm eye contact."Mon général, I am a wizard," A small flame danced at his fingertips. "I have no liberties to protect, my magic gives me all the freedom I need."The general's piece landed on a skull, reflecting the orange glow as he moved it several spaces back.He continued. "I have no need of obtaining any more freedoms, I have no need of maintaining any pride, I am only concerned about my own security and that of others around me."The general stared intently at the board."Which is put at risk by your civil constitution and your revolution." Harry toyed with the dice in his free hand.He blinked, eyes wandering the drawings. "A small price to pay for the greater good.""But is it worth all the pain, mon général? Wizards and muggles don't mix well—they never have—and getting rid of this separation—this shield—will only cause more trouble than it's worth."There was a slight, awkward pause. "It is never that simple, Monsieur Potter. We do not fight for our own selfish whims, we fight for humanity, and that include both wizards and your so-called muggles.""You will be leaving with Mademoiselle Daphné."Harry dropped his piece. "You'll let me go that easily?"The general responded. "The Mademoiselle seems to have more use for you than I.""Just think about what I said, mon général."Harry stood up, carefully retracing his steps as he exited the room, shutting the door behind him with a slam.Both game pieces were still stalled near the beginning of the spiral.

The city was on fire, and Harry would have liked to think it wasn't his fault.They'd just regrouped with the army at Luxembourg. The city was surrounded, the army already in the process of dismantling the supposed last bastion of oppression in the Low Countries.Harry just felt out of place.He was still a prisoner, he still didn't have his wand, but it seemed that he was now in some form accepted within the ranks of the army. Daphné had stopped binding him after his meeting with the general, and therefore, physically, he was unrestrained.None of that meant he could go anywhere, however. His wand was still in Daphné's possession, and he had absolutely no idea how to escape from the continent with or without it.But that didn't mean he wasn't able to cause a whole lot of trouble, unintentionally or not.The heat of the open flames clashed violently with the freezing winter air, the smoke billowing from the timber roofs, encapsulating the atmosphere with a heavy charring. Daphné stood next to him, visage slightly distorted and discoloured by the bubble-head charm she'd cast on herself.The troops were paused at the sight, mouths wide open as the ribbons of flame endlessly spiralled through the air, engulfing everything in its path. The battle seemed to be stopped, both sides ceased by the sheer incredulity of the situation."Just how exactly did you manage this?" Daphné turned towards him with an unbelieving expression.He cowered. "I'm… not sure.""You can't surely… do something like this by accident, can you?"Harry winced. "It seems so."She huffed. "I can't believe it. You don't even have your wand."They were interrupted by an intense barrage of artillery fire, rousing the previously stalled chaos of the siege. Daphné waved her wand, deflecting the shrapnel in their paths with seeming ease, completely disregarding the total disorder unfolding around her.He braved a question. "What exactly are you trying to accomplish?""I'm trying to capture the city, petit malin." Daphné glared at him.They continued, alone, up the deserted street. A burning beam fell out of the sky next to them, immediately melting the patch of snow on the ground."How exactly are you going to go about doing that?""Wait and see."The buildings continued to smoulder, the dark smoke only adding to the already extreme disarray, obscuring their visions in the haze. Harry struggled to keep up with her pace."We're past the front lines. Are you sure you're not out of your mind?""Quite certain."They continued to traverse through the cobbled streets, astonishingly coming across little disturbance as they drew increasingly nearer to the towering inner-city walls. Compared to spotlessness of Amsterdam, the streets of Luxembourg weree strangely invigorating. The effects of the passing war were completely visible, parts of the city were heavily damaged, and an enormous tension seemed to shroud the entire area.It was quite delightful, in a way. He delighted in the feeling as if the world was rushing around him, moving on without his involvement. He delighted in the pace of events, each passing second seemingly overturning the previous. He delighted in the scale of the battle, the thousands of individuals congregating together to participate on a single platform.The city must have once been extremely beautiful. It still was, in a gruesome way. Once, not so long ago, whole families had regularly crossed the now desolate streets, carrying on their lives without worry, or knowledge, of the upcoming turmoil that would be brought to their homes. It was liberating, in a sense, to carry on without the presence of any stability—without the presence of anything grounding. The lifelessness of his surroundings seemed to indicate that—the previous inhabitants had moved on, in death, or somewhere else.They eventually came to a stop behind a whitewashed, timber-framed house, still almost unaffected despite the devouring flames in its proximity. Daphné soon became deep in concentration, twirling her wand in intricate patterns, releasing thin wisps of light blue frost into the air, cloaking the environs with a layer of light, dusted particles. The frost settled, extinguishing previously burning roofs, leaving nothing but heavy charring and mild bits of moisture.The scene was remarkably pleasing, Harry thought. The faint tendrils of steam were almost cleansing, bringing a certain serenity to the chaos. The way the heat and flames just vanished, assimilating into the coldness around it was refreshing. It really was strange. There was death, destruction, and violence all around him but where he was—in his little bubble—he felt safe, protected, even if it was only momentary. He would have been content just dying right there, he thought, lost in the tranquillity of the very instant.He shut his eyes, relishing his feeling of euphoria, his warmth despite the icy cold, his comfort despite the clearly uncomfortable situation. The warmth continued to linger, however, and soon it became uncomfortably hot, scalding.When he reopened his eyes, the only thing he could see was red.The city was on fire, again, and Daphné knew it was definitely Potter's fault.The siege had not been going in their favour when they arrived, and hours later, it was certainly still not going in their favour.She pressed her palm to her forehead, exasperated. "Potter, out of everything you could have done accidentally, could you please have done something of help?"Her companion was staring at the ash-covered ground, avoiding her gaze. "I'm… really not sure. Besides, we're supposed to be enemies, aren't we?""It would be rather nice if you were of any help," Daphne responded stiffly, "Considering that I'm the only thing that's been keeping you alive."She released a deep sigh, scanning her surroundings. There was panicked shouting coming from all directions, each crumble of the collapsing structures furthering the extent of the commotion. Unlike the previous instance, the fighting continued, the explosions and shouts only increasing in intensity with each passing second.For the first time in her time with the Revolutionary Army, Daphné was at a loss for what to do. She bit her bottom lip frustratingly. She'd always prided herself in her capabilities, but at the very moment, she felt helpless, completely at the mercy of everything around her.It wasn't a nice feeling.Her prisoner had now recovered from his embarrassment, looking at her intently, and with curiosity. She'd always been proud, but now, she just wanted to cower, to hide from the shame of not being capable of handling the situation. Even if it was from one of her inferiors, before whom she promised to herself never to show any sign of weakness. She struggled to keep herself from hyperventilating. She was supposed to be confident, sure of herself, and able.But she felt weak.It was still all his fault, of course. The absolute cretin had managed to disturb her spell not once, but twice with his ridiculous accidental magic. She knew he acted like a child, but it was completely out of the question that he would suffer from the same afflictions as one. She'd prepared for the worst situations imaginable before the left for the front, but it never would have been—should have been something completely unimaginable amongst fully-grown adult wizards.It was the coldest winter in decades (she might have had something to do with it), and all the men were starving, freezing, and ridden with disease. Supplies were extremely scarce; they'd been surrounding the city for months, and every single bit of the surrounding area had been emptied of all of its resources. Somehow, absolutely none of those issues were as disastrous as what her obnoxious prisoner had managed to do accidentally. She had trained for years to perfect her skills and Potter had the gall to set the outer limits of an entire city on fire accidentally?She looked around agitatedly. She didn't know how to remedy this—her spell was ruined, the troops were panicked, dying, and Potter was most likely still inclined to muck up the situation again in some form. Taking deep, drawn out breaths, she began to stumble towards her prisoner."Is everything alright?" He seemed to have recovered from his daze and was now looking at her inquisitively.Daphné only glowered at him. The chaos around her felt completely irrelevant, the smouldering around her seemingly disappearing as she directed the entirety of her attention onto Potter. She calmed, bottling up her thoughts, refraining from erupting for a moment.Without warning, she began to yell furiously. "Out of everything you could have done, could you not have compromised our entire success? The entire operation is collapsing just because you couldn't hold back something you should have had under control as a child?"Her companion visibly flinched; his expression annoyingly perplexed. "I swear—I really have no idea what got over me. I was distracted for a moment, and the next thing I knew, it was absolutely scalding, and everything was burning."He seemed quite flustered, and Daphné couldn't really sympathise. He had, after all, managed to spoil the entire conquest of the Low Countries, possibly delaying for days, weeks—even months.Now, surrounded by a panicked, retreating army, artillery barrages, and enveloped in a sea of flames, there was only a single possible target for her ire, and she was determined not to let go of any of her grievances."I wouldn't suffer any consequence if you died right here, right now." She spoke softly, voice laced with daggers."And so," she inched closer, almost touching the charred flakes on the tips of his eyebrows, her laurel wand prodded into his chest, "you will not do anything that will harm, or even inconvenience us, intentionally or not, because I will be requesting that you be executed the moment you step just a finger out of line."Daphné almost laughed at the display before her. His bright green eyes seemed to be literally exuding fear; his ruffled complexion worsened by his very obviously frightened expression. She withdrew to a more comfortable distance.The structures were still collapsing if the constant noise and debris on the ground was any indication. The smoke was still overwhelming, severely inhibiting her vision. She knew, however, that her comrades were long gone, fled from the scene of battle amid the chaos, retreated to recuperate from their losses. It was slightly problematic, because of this, that they were still trapped in its wake, fortunately unnoticed by anybody in the vicinity.The only issue was that there wasn't anybody in the vicinity, and the defenders had already passed their current retreat, placing themselves between the two magicals and the rest of the army.They were in for a bit of a challenge, but Daphné wasn't one to give up.She moved her hand beneath her neckline, smiling slightly as she felt for the hard, textured silver beneath the soft fabric. She would eventually prevail, of that there wasn't any doubt.She turned towards her still slightly startled companion. "Come, Potter. We'll be needing to find a way out of here."It seemed to Harry that his luck had finally run out. He'd managed to survive much longer than he'd expected, nevertheless, so he shouldn't have really minded.He minded very much, however. He quite liked living, even if he was trapped for the foreseeable future. Whether that was an issue, he thought, was disputable. He'd grown to quite like his captor, despite how frightening she could be some—no—all of the time.He groaned at the burning structures in his proximity. There didn't seem to be anything around that wasn't dangerous, there didn't seem to be anything around that could work to their benefit, and there didn't seem to be any way to rescue themselves from the situation. He'd have felt much safer with his wand.A wand that was currently in the possession of a certain badly-tempered blonde witch.It was of no matter, if he was going to die today, he would be much more satisfied if he died with her to an Austrian soldier rather than to her.He ventured to speak. "Where will we be going, Mademoiselle?"His captor scowled, a sight he'd grown used to seeing. It was quite a nice scowl."We're quite trapped, in case if you haven't noticed."He risked a quip. "I did escape from a prison once, Mademoiselle."The cobbled streets were now covered with a thin layer of light grey ash, merging with the small patches of snow that had not yet succumbed to the heat. Their feet crunched against the ground as they inched themselves closer to the tanned stone of the city walls.Harry baulked. "We're going this way?""I'm not exactly keen on crossing the entire army in the other direction, Potter." Daphné tapped her wand on the bricks."Into the city?""It seems so, yes.""Won't we be captured?""Hopefully not, we don't exactly look like soldiers, do we? I think I'd much rather confront a few guards instead of an entire army."She waved her wand, vanishing the soot that had previously blanketed them. The wall rapidly animated, manifesting into a symmetrical archway, behind which lay a second wall, this time out of red brick. It reminded Harry awfully of home, of trips to London—to Diagon Alley. He shook the thoughts from his mind. He couldn't afford to be homesick now, in all likelihood he'd never set foot in Britain again, even if he survived.Carefully crouching through the archway, he looked up. The timber roof of the house they'd entered behind was still immaculate. The brick was pristine, if not slightly mossy. The scene reminded him of Amsterdam—seemingly completely unaffected by the destruction in its midst.Harry stopped in his tracks. "This is… the exact same city we were just in?"He could have imagined that Daphné snorted. "You haven't burned all of it down, thankfully. If you haven't forgotten, the outside looked like this a few hours ago. Now, please don't be too obvious. We're in a muggle city and they're bound to hold a quite a bit of dislike for us."He grimaced. "I think I've learned my lesson.""You better have."They exited the alley and came to face with rabbles of city-goers, seemingly tense with the ongoing siege beyond the walls. Life as usual seemed to be continuing, however, its people pacing about, running errands, working, and doing whatever muggles did on their own.It was suffocating.

Philippa waited until the man was gone from the street. She walked backwards from the window and even though she bumped into a table on her way to the kitchen and even though she was alone she still stood still at the noise she had made and continued to stare at the front door, her eyes darting to the window. When she reached the kitchen, she opened a small side door and crouched to get in the small space. She moved a small slide out of the way and behind it a small landing in front of a staircase. She squeezed herself through and moved as silently as she could through the old creaky building. The stair opened up to a catwalk and the backs of other small doors that she knew had long been sealed on the occupants' side. She rapped on one of the doors and made her way through without waiting for an answer. She found herself in a cozy carpeted room all dark burgundy and light wood and light streaming into the attic room. She padded through the room reflexively pulling a cobweb out of her way even though the path had been clear and there were no spiders that made their way there. She cleaned the way herself. She maintained the way herself. She felt at home in the old woman's house and made a small call so as not to startle her. They had agreed the way would be used for emergencies.The old woman making tea in her own kitchen stood still to listen. The girl. She pulled out another teacup. She knew the house sounds before the door opened upstairs. She knew the difference between a cat and something several times its side. When Philippa cleaned she was less careful and quiet but Robin didn't think it necessary to tell the girl that. She had lived here long enough to know also, that the other tenants would chalk the noise up to old house sounds like the marbles in the pipes, the creaking, the yawning in the walls from a tired frame. She didn't hear the faint click of the door or Philippa's footsteps but a small whistle as if from a bird. A small, high-pitched, faint tremolo. By the time the girl started descending the carpeted stairs the old woman was passing with a teacup looking up curious."I thought I might have heard a nightingale," She said chuckling. "Tea?""Sorry," the girl said. "I didn't want to startle you,"She wasn't really a girl the old woman observed. But then the old woman wasn't really old, she thought. The landlady knew someone might come for Philippa again. When she rented the flat, Robin sensing she had one last question, opened her small, warm landlady face and asked patiently if there was anything else Philippa would be needing to let the flat. "Doors", the girl had said unflinching. It had startled the landlady. Philippa would have said it eventually, she had had too. She could fake the length of a stay, she thought but, Robin had let rooms and flats and houses her entire life. She knew what a woman running away looked like. She knew a patchwork renter's history when she saw one. She called the other references. All on time but broke every lease. Every single one of them and over such a short period of time. The next time Philippa came back, Robin asked and the woman told her. Not everything she was sure but it took her back all the same. It startled her, the woman's candor and resolve and that she could articulate what the problem was. Either she didn't recognize how disarming it was or didn't care or was sick."The doors. What did you mean, doors?" Robin asked."To get out of. Like a door," Philippa replied flatly.Robin could sense the woman's sarcasm even as she told the landlady, not in so many words, that she needed to run away but something about Philippa reminded Robin of a younger version of herself or rather, the person she had always imagined she could become: clever and unafraid.Anyways, Robin had always been told that crazy people didn't have a sense of humor so she let Philippa the flat. The woman stayed and when Robin was certain, she showed Philippa the path on her move-in date."All the others were bricked up. You can check if you like but you'll see once you get inside. This flat and mine were left."Robin started talking about her life as a little girl. Her parents had acquired a flat for sale in those days which was unheard of at the time. In England? Her mother worked at the resorts and knew that the white man selling it was trying to drive down housing prices when other Jamaicans moved in. Robin's mother didn't care and neither did her father and so they purchased the flat that Philippa would let and then the one next to it and the next until they owned the entire building. The white man who sold it could then buy the buildings next to it when the property value sank and in less than a generation, the property value would go back up and he could resell those same buildings for an unreal sum. Philippa listened impassive. Her face still. The landlady assumed she was boring the woman and stopped mid-sentence."Go on," Philippa said."Oh, well, then they…" Robin had lost her train of thought."The London flat". Philippa said."Well," the landlady went on tentative, looking to the floor and Philippa for reassurance and instead was met with her stillness. Robin thought she droned on as she got to how her parents acquired so many more places. Rented out just for blacks originally but then someone kicked up a fuss as if anyone else but the islanders had been knocking down the doors and her parents had barred anyone for renting in the first place. Robin wrang her hands together. Philippa's expression didn't change. It was made all the stranger by the men moving the woman's furniture in. They were standing in the kitchen making a soft commotion all around. When one would ask Philippa a question she would answer without changing expression directing them through a home she'd never been in as if she had lived there the entire time. That she was listening to everything around her at once and had divined the very essence of the flat and the people in it at the time. Robin felt as if she had bored the woman long enough and that Philippa would rather unpack in her stoic peace and yet when the landlady paused in a strange place or made to leave Philippa urged her on.It made the landlady nervous and she found it off-putting but reminded herself that Philippa was running away after all. Or maybe not. It crossed Robin's mind that Philippa might be the problem in whatever story she did not tell the landlady but brushed the thought aside. She continued her story getting to the part where she was finally old enough to have her own place."Well anyway, my parents moved to live where my flat is now and I lived here." Philippa smiled and nodded.The woman nodded. Philippa had heard this story somewhere before, that's how the she acted. Maybe the old woman had told it already but when? Maybe she was getting old. They were sitting in silence now. The movers getting things placed upstairs. The sound of the heavy feet something the landlady could focus on. She smiled at Philippa less assured. Robin felt like somewhere a clock was ticking at an unnaturally high volume."When they leave, the door?""Yes!" the landlady said too cheerful given the quietness that sat in front of Philippa's question. Robin was just thankful to have a reason to make a noise, some evidence that she was still alive and hadn't slipped into death and that the remainder of eternity wasn't just sitting here in silence forever.This felt very familiar. Robin had a tenant not unlike this one. Several. As she got older, she managed her parents' properties and met many tenants off their rocker. This one paid in coins or tried to barter in bread knuckles, this one hit his wife, this one cooked cat meat said this nosy neighbor whose cat was missing but also who cooked food that smelled like it might have been cat meat... Robin had heard it all, seen it all, fixed so much of it and it shocked so many people to learn that this small woman managed the properties and even owned some of her own. The old woman sighed."I'll be back later to show you though I cant go in myself anymore." she smiled as much to herself as to Philippa. I am old. This is a little girl, Robin thought. The Philippa nodded and ushered Robin to the front door."Until then," said Philippa who stood at the door as if she would shut it even as the movers brought in the remainder of her things.When the landlady looked behind her Philippa was gone from the doorway. Robin looked at the expanse of the flat and walked to her own from the outside. When she got back she padded up the stairs. Everything still there she snorted. Still the same place, the same warmth, the same smell. She inhaled deeply and went upstairs, opened the door to the attic upstairs and checked the door. Still closed. She slowly crouched down and opened the door peering in and looked both ways. Same as ever. A little dusty but overall ok. She smoothed a cobweb out of her hair as she went back into the room. Robin sat on the floor cross legged. Since she wasn't thinking about it, she got up much smoother than she got on the floor in the first place. She straightened her skirt with a mission on her mind. She went to the drawer and pulled out a set of keys of the many, went back to the little door and locked it for the first time in a very long time. She would visit the girl tomorrow and let her know about the door in her kitchen. She would let her know about the path to her flat and her door and listen and decide and compose herself before hand. She would be prepared and not look like a little, old fool next time. Would she tell Philippa about the war years, the old, old war years when they built flats like this so that neighbors could hide in the walls and- no. Robin was old but, also knew that, for all those years, some people were younger but had lived more, so to speak. She would leave her encyclopedic knowledge of crawl spaces and wars and architecture and property law out of it. And they would go from there.***Robin went to the kitchen to grab the second cup of tea and went upstairs to sit in the small attic room with the young woman. She set the teacup on the table and stirred her own, sipping quietly. By now she was used to this girl and her quietness."My friend has died," Said Philippa in the same even tone she used when she first met the landlady.The old woman's heart lurched. It wasn't fair but it was life. Young people died young too."I knew but someone just came with the news. This was the emergency." Philippa drew in deep measured breaths into her nose before folding over.If Robin hadn't been that old she might not have been able to tell that Philippa was crying at all. When Philippa finally looked up at the ceiling wiping her eyes, the only evidence that she had been crying were her red eyes and sniffling her voice remained strangely even, even monotone. Of course her friend's death was bad but what did that mean she already knew? Robin wondered. Of course, that wasn't the emergency. The landlady asked Philippa is she was safe. Philippa breathed and said nothing but they both knew she heard. When the landlady was about to set the teacup down, Philippa said, yes, she thought so."I think, maybe, I might be now. Maybe I was never in danger to begin with." She turned to look at the window over her landlady's shoulder and smiled in a far off absentminded way. "Thank you." said Philippa.They made their way down the stairs in Robin's home, Philippa carrying a cup of tea she hadn't sipped from and left it in the kitchen. Robin walked her to the front of the door. Philippa looked both ways as she crossed the street and it was now the landlady who stared out of her window. The woman did not ever speak to her more than fifteen minutes ever again. For Robin's part, how would she have known that Philippa had locked the door on her side again? For Philippa's part she crossed the street thankful that someone had asked her a question she was afraid to ask herself and that she answered and believed what she had said. Maybe she had never been in danger at all. In any case she no longer believed she was now.

Dorcas and Basil made every effort not to run up the street. Dorcas especially had confused many people in her time. You could not tell that her strides were that much longer than her height should have allowed and yet she always seemed to arrive slightly earlier than everyone else even if they started from the same place at the same time. That mixed with the determination of ensuring her friend was safe resulted in her skip walking just short of running made Basil, whose stride did match his height, winded in an effort to match her speed. Even as Dorcas pushed open the back gate she heard a glass break, exploding loudly and then, after mere seconds it took to orient herself, heard another. She broke into a run in the backyard and watched as the back window burst again and repair itself. The shards pieced themselves together as if pulled by tiny threads back into place until they cracked and burst Basil caught up to Dorcas looking back and forth from the window and door assessing what was happening and what she might do about it."Me," Basil huffed.Dorcas looked at him, her eyebrows knit on her forehead, irritated and still very much confused."In case intruders. Magic." Huff. "Alarm."She understood and approached the house with greater resolve. She and Basil went up the small steps and Dorcas raised her wand unlocking the door as it swung open silently into a dark kitchen. They both went through the kitchen and to the hallway where she motioned for Basil to go upstairs. She had done this many, many times before but this felt different. Her training prepared her for a great many things and as confident as she was in her own skill and the training she received to use counter spells, offensive and defensive strategies, all of it, she realized that she was getting weaker. Something in Dorcas now was already failing her. She flinched at the bloom of clean, bluish light that reflected on the glass in the picture frames. She hadn't even noticed how dark it was until the light disappeared completely up the stairs with Basil holding his wand aloft and she squeezed her eyes shut to adjust her eyesight to the dark again. She could have walked in that house blindfolded if she wanted to. She felt ill. Her outstretched arm felt heavy as she rounded the corner to her left into the sitting room passing what looked like a little ceramic volcano puff, puffing away small clouds in sets of twos on the side table in the short hallway. She turned to find her best friend crouched and trembling in the corner and shielding her grandfather who was bunched into the corner but protected on one side by a couch and on the other side an old but well-maintained, upright piano, his granddaughter facing him and telling him that everything was going to be alright. That she wouldn't leave him alone for anything."Is there anyone else here?" Dorcas was impressed by the steadiness of her voice and at least seeing Philippa and Grandpa there, some of her focus returned. She could feel the sickness drop away.Philippa started to hear her friend's voice and slowly looked over her shoulder shaking as she was yet managed to communicate 'no'. Both Dorcas and Philippa turned at the sound of Basil barreling down the stairs, the wand still lit as Philippa and Dorcas squinted against the brightness. Dorcas gestured at the light switch and the house now was full and bright. Basil went to help Philippa off the floor as Dorcas went through the remainder of the house. She could have cast a spell to reveal anyone else's presence but used the time to steady herself. The hand not carrying the wand placed on her breastbone, steadying herself from the inside. Back in the sitting room, she found all of them sitting on the couches. Philippa with her head resting against the wall, eyes closed and breathing deeply. Basil rubbed his face with both hands as if rinsing the exertion off of himself. He would not be an Auror, he decided that evening. Grandpa, sitting next to his granddaughter smiling softly as if nothing had happened at all. Dorcas went to get some water. She hadn't thought to check the fesfium but it confirmed that there were only two wizards in the house. She sent a quiet spell into the house behind her to determine that she was right and when she was certain Dorcas dropped her arm holding what felt like a wand made out of lead and gold and every elephant that ever existed.She brought the glasses and a pitcher of water into the room."Grandpa," she raised her voice slightly, "Everything is fine. We're all safe. Here's some water,"Philippa winced."Can you do something about the glass?"Dorcas looked at the pitcher on the table and then heard it again. Dorcas hadn't even noticed, it had become background noise. Dorcas motioned for Basil to go to the kitchen and left Philippa on the couch with grandpa who was now leaning against the wall too. From where Dorcas stood she could not see that Philippa and Grandpa were holding hands and because Philippa's eyes were still closed and her head still tilted back against the wall, no one, regardless of where they were standing could see her tears cycling themselves under her eyelids."I thought it would be a good idea, a way to let Pippa know when someone magical came into the yard." Basil said in between muttering a spell."Good idea, just next time warn me about it, please," Dorcas said, her eyebrows going up to emphasize the point.Basil shook his head up and down knowing there would not be a next time. Dorcas had been kind enough to take him on "assignment" and his nerves still weren't settled. He had no choice that he was alive during a war but he had a choice to be an Auror and no, thank you. He wasn't too proud but he was too frazzled to mention that his own spell had unnerved him. The loudness of it. Even as the window sat repaired, a still pane, he half expected it to shatter again. If he felt that way, he could not imagine how Philippa must have felt. Basil could do magic and she could not. He had not considered what it meant for a window or anything else to do that and not be able to do much else and it made him sick to think if it hadn't been them. Dorcas seemed to hold up better but she did this for a living. He could tell she was irritated though."You are free to go, Basil. Thank you. Please tell Lupin I'm staying here tonight."Basil felt relieved that he didn't have to stay in the house with the loud windows and the uncertainty. What had made them go there anyway? Just recently it had been such a cozy home and now it seemed empty and eerie. Dorcas watched Basil shut the door behind him.When Dorcas got back to the sitting room she saw Philippa talking to grandpa from across the coffee table picking up after the dishes Dorcas had just brought in."Basil's left," Dorcas said."Help me get him upstairs?"Dorcas shook her head and with a flick of her wand grandpa lifted into the air gentle as a sheet of paper. He started to laugh. Dorcas smiled despite herself. She could feel Philippa looking at her but didn't turn to face her. She walked behind Grandpa who floated up the stairs still laughing. He motioned towards the bathroom door and she sat him gently there closing the door with another small flick of her wrist. When she heard a flush she turned on the water, he washed his hands and he floated out of the bathroom laughing all the while. Dorcas now felt better. Grandpa loved magic. Loved it. And she didn't have to do anything too showy either. In his bedroom she turned her back and with another wave he was changed into fresh pajamas and tucked in bed all of this in a matter of minutes. Grandpa was in peels now, showing his sparse but still strong, white teeth. She turned at the door."Goodnight Grandpa. I love you.""And oo, Dodie," he said and made a little kissing noise after. She could here him snuggling down for the evening and laughing to himself as she went out of the room."Crack the door," Philippa called from the bottom of the stairs. Dorcas went down the stairs in two's well pleased with herself."Can you sleep here tonight?""That was my plan," said Dorcas."Are you hungry?""No. Are you? I can cook.""No!" Rounded Philippa and they both laughed even as Dorcas sensed that something wasn't quite right.Philippa went about setting the water cups and pitcher away, the blanket that had slipped from Grandpa's lap when Dorcas levitated him folded over the back of a chair. Without turning around even as she set the dishes away Philippa asked,"When we were little, there was a man who sold popsicles down the street from here. What did we call him?" Philippa was moving rather slowly and what a strange question to ask thought Dorcas."Ice Pickles? No, Sock Pickles! It was Sock Pickles!" Dorcas hadn't thought of it in so long! Sock Pickles! "Why?", she asked.Dorcas sensed Philippa relax. She inhaled and exhaled deeply, as if a switch was turned, she moved at regular speed again."Sock Pickles, yes. That was it." Philippa nodded to herself and turned with a smile to face Dorcas. "I had forgotten. Help me put this away and then we can go to sleep.""Enough excitement for one night," said Dorcas. Philippa smiled an automatic, smile. A smile that didn't reach her eyes. Dorcas thought nothing of it, it had been a long night. But everything was fine; they were all fine after all. They tidied the kitchen went upstairs and got ready for bed.It wasn't until Philippa tucked into her bed on one side of the wall and Dorcas in her bed at the other that Philippa started to say "the lights". By the time she finished the words, they were all already turned off and shortly after saying goodnight, Dorcas was sound asleep. It was as if she had not, even a few hours ago, made herself sick with worry at what she might (or might not) find when she arrived. She was asleep as if she did things like this everyday.

The birthday party had not only gone off without several incidences but even better than expected. Everyone there had all treated Philippa like their own friend and not the friend of a friend that she actually was to most of them. And while Dorcas did have some reservations once the event was underway, she realized she had had nothing to worry about at all and that Philippa would have fit right in, and did, muggle or not. The morning of their sort of, almost annual birthday party found Philippa more used to the little puffs of odorless smoke popping up from what looked like a little volcano. She was less afraid of the fusfium now and a good thing, since when the party was underway, with all the wizards and witches in attendance, it could no longer chug away in regular intervals and just streamed a thin line of what looked like steam. It made her less nervous now even as she thought she shouldn't get too comfortable with the small device. So far it had only meant new friends and loved ones were near. That a good time was soon approaching or that she would learn something exciting and wild and different.She was not a jealous person but this was as close to jealousy as she would ever get. She thought with great reverence of all things things Dorcas could do but at the party she had learned more and seen more than ever. A comfort and fluency with magic like it was the plainest thing in the world (and according to Lydia, drunk and getting steadily grumpier over time, magic really was ordinary if you could do it).Philippa had been to a fair once and had seen a magician. Even as she learned he might have been an actual wizard, what he had done had been total nonsense. In fact, she was certain he hadn't been a real wizard at all. She was certain that Dorcas could move the entire house if she wanted to, just lift it in the air and set it in one quiet piece in a field somewhere or maybe the bottom of the ocean. So far she had made pots and pans fly mostly for Philippa's pure astonishment. For her wide-eyed disbelief. Philippa still waved her hands under floating objects expecting to feel a string or something to hold the object up. She reached out her hand to touch what she once believed were common objects as if to touch a wild but gentle animal. Now a wisp of cloud, now floating in mid air. Did Lupin say that some could be turned into animals? Philippa had declined the demonstration. No, no she didn't want a dish spoon with a tail to squirm away from them to be found slinking in the dark months later and yet…"A bird? From what?!" She looked around, it seemed they were always in the kitchen then months before everything happened at once, the table covered in notes and books and according to everyone who saw her sitting there while they read, violating every law across the two communities."What happens if you violate the statute of secrecy?" She asked Lupin."Why are you whispering?" Dorcas retorted who made no effort to conceal her laughter at Philippa's sincerity and fear.But Dorcas didn't seem to care nor did Lupin, apparently, who brought her all the books he could find or, what did he say? Spirit away. After a time she didn't care either and built up a nerve and curiosity to actually see the magic itself. She could read it, imagine it but here were two capable wizards, why not? What was the harm, really? Surely between them and Fabian they could find a fork-cat wherever it squeezed itself into hiding."Throw it into the air," Philippa dared him.The bowl, before her very eyes, turned into a bird as it fell through the air. Righting itself before it hit the ground and lifting its plain, regular, grey, bird wings.The bird sat on the edge of the table and turned back into its blue bowl self with hardly a twist of Lupin's wrist."Unreal," she whispered to herself.Lupin enjoyed this more than wandering wherever it was he liked to wander. Well, not more more. He enjoyed that he could do this, impress someone. Especially since the person he most wanted to move and shock was so cavalier about so many things. Philippa and her endless, observant questions that turned into insights she gleaned from her study. He liked testing her ideas. Could that happen? Why hadn't he thought of that? And Dorcas correcting some of his technique. He had never wanted to be an Auror but he appreciated that he could learn something too. Mostly though, he love that the Groves's felt like a proper home. He enjoyed being in a warm house where no one asked him about moon cycles and questioned his bottomless hunger. Philippa really could cook and plied him with dishes and showed that she appreciated him being able to find so many exotic ingredients and they had reached an understanding between them a combination of learning and cooking and him reading to Grandpa Groves from the newspaper and having a backyard to sleep in. Philippa chalked up this behavior to some wizard behavior or convention that she was sure he would explain in time as she gazed out of the window for the upteenth time after she saw a single puff of smoke emanating from fusfium and a tap, tap, tapping on the window signaling that Lupin was making himself comfortable in the yard. She explained that it would be no problem for him to sleep in Dorcas's bed or on the couch but he insisted. She didn't press the point. Frankly she had seen stranger things and some part of her just believed that her desire to be around magic must be matched by his apparent need to live like a muggle hobo. She shrugged going through the house and went to sit in the living room to play piano for Grandpa before bed.On days when Lupin did stay in the house and they made something of a family, he could show Philippa magic and sensed the unfairness of it, that she gave more than he could give her. After months of studying, Philippa's command of the language and theory of magic increased exponentially. There was a time when he could bring a book and it took her time to understand what the words and ideas in those books meant and at the height of this study, she could polish off several books in a matter of weeks. The line of questions became more obscure, the theory more difficult so that he deferred to Dorcas who later had to defer to Alastor or Kingsley and it went in a massive circle and star all of them collecting information on magic they had never heard of, that they had never thought of doing because they didn't even know if it was possible. She could not do the magic that she dreamt up, magic that she knew so well but, even still he noticed, that the small feats never tired. It was especially this little magic that amused and shocked Philippa the most. The little ceramic chimney did not impress her, the tales of werewolves, Dorcas noticed Lupin developed a coughing fit upon Philippa asking details of magical creatures, were worth only passing commentary."Indeed," Dorcas said moving in and out of the kitchen taking care of grandpa. "Water, Remus?"Philippa yawned through tales of great duels."I'm sure it was beautiful in person," interested but unmoved.It was this, young magic, magic that even little kids could do that made her eyes sparkle. Dorcas for her part was impressed to find that Philippa was the same as she had always been with her nose literally so far in a book that Dorcas convinced herself that Philippa was exaggerating that she couldn't see the words an-"Glasses! Thats why you've always read like that!" Dorcas exclaimed one day."Why didn't you just say something."Dorcas drew circles around her friends eyes and said something. What had she said? Philippa felt her eyes squidge in her head and enormous pressure baring down on her forehead and almost on the brink of closing her eyes, the pressure vanished."There! I'm not a ward sister but I think that should do it. Is it better?"And Philippa for the first time in a long time could make out the drawn expression on Dorcas's face."Well?", Dorcas pursed her lips and Philippa could see, from where she sat that Dorcas hoped she accomplished the thing she had. She could see the print on the blouse her shirt was held up and rotated her hand and saw the shape of her own fingernails at reasonable fingernail size which is to say at arms length and just unbelievable. She could have cried but was too shocked. She could see Dorcas smile at her and exaggerated nod and then draw her hand across her forehead wiping mock sweat off of her brow."Whew! Not to bad for intention, investment, intonation," Dorcas said.Philippa's eyesight improved at the same time that their knowledge of magic was really taking off. She read about much more in those books and faster. Bones turned to jelly and elongated and frozen at a greater length, A series of incantations to set ceilings on fire from the inside, to block out this, to keep this in and dragons? Real ones?"Of course," said Dorcas.

Dorcas derived great joy watching Philippa read these books like they were fairy tales of which they were to her. How would she find a way for her to actually see a dragon in real life? Dorcas wondered. Philippa pieced together words and ideas and shapes and histories. She developed a working knowledge of the things she couldn't use in her own life that were simple to others and literally impossible for her. She began to speak a language with no practical implications to herself."Can you make them up too? Spells, I mean.," Philippa said one day without looking up from her notes on her right hand side and writing without looking at the paper on her left. A book with a bowl full of untouched stew used as a weight to keep the pages open. Lupin looking at the stew with longing.She had always been the far superior student, Dorcas knew. If they had both attended Hogwarts, Dorcas might not even be an auror now. Everyone would have just considered Dorcas to be Philippa's competent but uninspired friend. She could keep pace, memorize, even think on her feet in her way. As it stood, she was one of the better in her class and certainly one of the greatest of the seventh years at the time but, that was only because Lydia had left school early. How unjust that she had everything she wanted but wasn't the more creative of the two, the funnier or more charismatic or kinder? That she only had this gift because of foolish luck?"These two can you mix them together? And these, could you make one that makes this spin and that leap and that soar at the same time?"That's how Philippa and Lupin met. Dorcas's potions skills, remained largely underutilized and Dorcas called him in and he had turned into Philippa's tutor of sorts. All of these questions, hours worth, where they would sit and talk about this and that and it got the better of him as it had of Dorcas earlier. He had to try himself. Could these two spells be said at the same time? Can you make that paper burst into flames and float at the same time though? The end result isn't the point, it's the idea! Exasperated Philippa looked over at Dorcas her expression saying, why doesn't he get it? He found he could not do both simultaneously as Dorcas had tried alone so as not to embarrass herself and she too had tried and failed and it was like this with many, many more combinations and spells and ideas until she resolved to practice like she had done in training and found that, this is a muggle equivalent, it was not unlike singing while playing the guitar with both hands while shaking someone's hand with a third. The intention changed in a way and from then on she sat at the table and listened to Philippa's ideas and got over the embarrassment of not being able to do and she failed, Merlin's beard did she ever fail, until she could do a great deal of what Philippa dreamt up and several more that she could not do.Dorcas thought sometimes that it may frustrate her. That Philippa couldn't do these things herself. That she had to watch other people try and fail and try and fail again knowing that if she had just a little bit of what they had, just a little bit of it, she could have accomplished everything sooner and more elegantly and developed more besides. Instead Dorcas, now long over her fear of being made a fool of in front of someone she had looked foolish in front of several hundreds of times before, tried."Does your wrist need to be held differently, it says here that…"When she finally got it, there was no trace of resentment or impatience or envy. Just her friend pleased and awed, shaking her head silently and smiling, almost to herself only "unreal".At this party though, her awe extended to the magic she read about that could not have been done in the comfort of the kitchen and dining space in the house that they had grown up in. The childlike magic that Lupin did, the combination spells that Dorcas tried. IT was at this party that she witnessed what she read about in some other radical form that made her suddenly interested in the tales of duels. Philippa herself had walked though a fire drawn at the edge of the door. A great blue flame that reached the top of the door frame and walked though it and nothing happened. Not nothing, how would she describe it? Nothing that a fire could do happened. And it was blue. So it must have been hotter, burning something else, she knew. She had heard pieces of conversations and places and people and things she had never read about. She could admit to herself that some of this magic was becoming commonplace, by my goodness. She could really put her knowledge to use. Combined with the new letters from Lydia (who remained unmoved by Philippa's insistence that they be sent by owl as the Royal Mail had always been and would continue to be faster) and sitting and talking with Lupin who brought the books and the notes and the plants? She reached a type of nirvana and comfort at that party. She had finally found her people. A comfort in her own home and in herself. Who would have known? A witch who couldn't do magic. And then she met a kid named Peter, one of Lupin's friends and they spent time discussing very obscure magic. He could answer some of the questions she had been waiting on answers for. He promised to find an answer to this problem of the bursting window. A way to communicate with Dorcas, he would find a way to call her if she needed to all in exchange for a to-go plate which she would have given to him anyway. And while the party had been beautiful, she hadn't noticed the time passing speaking with him, he had been a complete delight and a sweetheart. Since he had shown up empty handed, he would send a gift through Lupin, he promised, but he had only meant to pass through and got distracted. He had given her the best gift of his complete attention and seriousness to finding a solution to a problem that had been bothering her and she felt a deep fondness for someone whom she had just met.Sirius? Sirius, right? Lupin's other friend who brought the wine which couldn't be refilled (this was not a foreign concept to Philippa but seemed to confuse many wizards and witches in attendance) made from some berry that she had enjoyed and enjoyed some more. Who else? Lydia and the Prewett's were there of course. Lupin was there. Basil came with a bouquet of roses looking very sheepish but relaxed over time. He too enjoyed the wine. And she finally met Alastor and Mr. Shacklebot and even though she had been told that they were very important, she knew right away when they walked in that important people, celebrated people, had walked in for all the side conversations and commotion they caused. Mr. Shacklebot brought a cake and Alastor a broach that she couldn't touch with her bare hands. He remembered that Philippa wouldn't, or rather shouldn't have known what a Duobus Signis was."A type of portkey," Philippa said as if reciting from a book. "It has the power to transport to more than one place. Very difficult to make. You need to the incantation to one place and then another set of incantations for the other, it can takes months to make these. Did the Ministry approve?" She said still marveling at what was an otherwise unremarkable, even ugly piece of jewelry.Dorcas watched Alastor's eyebrows go to together in a type of uncharacteristic confusion. At Philippa's question, his eyebrows had raised even as she answered her own question."I can't imagine they would approve but there's no way to monitor the movement of portkeys anyway." She smiled a warm, genuine smile. "Thank you, it's incredible."She closed the lid and Alastor regaining enough composure to return the kindness. He looked at Dorcas and she looked like the hippogriff that ate the bezoar, a sly, impressed smile. Philippa, a muggle had caught the great Alastor Moody off-guard. So much for constant vigilance. I'll tell you later she said as Philippa was called away to impress and stun and laugh and dance and become everyone's new best friend and be loved by everyone there. Alastor nodded. He would not hear the end of this. "It is an incredible gift," Dorcas said trying not to laugh but also meaning it but also knowing that he was trying to cover his surprise at who he had been told was a muggle-born muggle. Dorcas was impressed by her friend and proud.All of these strangers had come to the birthday party and she thought then that they had left as friends. It had been such a good time and Philippa could forget about what happened before and relax and enjoy herself. The memory, the memories were tucked away in the back of her mind but they slept undisturbed as she bounced through the party with Dorcas. Even after she thought of it, which was rarely, it seemed so far away and receded farther away in time but, when she did even after everything that happened, that would happen, she reveled in the memory of the event and the magic of it all. Ha.

She had been given specific instructions not to trust anyone from her world who didn't know either of their "real names". The irony being that these were the nicknames they had given one another a long time ago when they were young. When, at that age, Philippa recognized they shared last names related to plants and green, growing things. They had built a sort of club with an exclusive, lifetime membership of only two. To get into this club, the only qualifications were that you had to be one of them and your favorite children's radio program had to be White Roses. This made membership easy. She had once been called Petal and her best friend, Tulip. And when they were much older and Tulip had told her, don't trust any of us, not even me, unless they know your real name Petal understood in a deep place and it made her sick to think that there would ever be a need for those names to be referenced and especially in this way. All of this was really happening and, of all of the trouble they had found themselves in over the years, that this was the most real, that one of them may never hear the other's voice or see the other ever again and it would be both a relief and a horror. The family down the street that had disappeared in the papers? That was us, Tulip said. It wasn't you, Petal said. What sat in the air between them was the rest of her question, was it? Was it you? Did you, specifically have anything to do with them? No, it wasn't me, me but it was us. Dorcas said out loud because they had known each other that long and they could have had this entire conversation silently and often did. One or the other would answer questions that hadn't been asked a loud disarming anyone in earshot. The conversation would become silent again neither of them realizing the conversation wasn't being spoken out loud in the first place.She had not noticed him behind her for almost two blocks now, which is not to say she didn't sense him, but she had felt like this on and off for months now in varying degrees and it was much better than it had been now. She had half a mind to turn around and that same moment she heard, not just her name but, two of them. The first time he had called her by her common nickname. Everyone knew she had called her that and she knew not to turn around but, did anyway. She found a tall man just off the sidewalk directly behind her closer than his voice had sounded. She impressed herself. She knew she did not look as startled as she felt. She turned around as if by coincidence, as if she had just turned around at any number of noises in the street and not her own name but her steps slowed conscious of the very real danger of this man who had magic or not. She squared her hips, laced her keys in her fingers and, if necessary, she would stand at her own door and knock, call up to someone who wasn't there and turn around as she had rehearsed in her mind, two times, nine times, thirty times, a hundred times until it looped on itself, tying into a knot. And yet here she was becoming more scared now as she had been then and it was the recognition and blooming fear she felt on her face that she had not practiced or adjusted for. She did not account for remembering. It was that same fear that told the man that he identified the correct woman even as she walked up the steps to her own home. He repeated in a slightly more confident but not threatening way, excuse me, Petal? And if she had understood what happened then, she would also remember that she had turned around and gone down the steps almost floating and even shook the man's hand and that she had made it up the steps again and unlocked her own door and almost ushered that very man through the door until she came back to her senses at the very last moment over the threshold with her hand on the doorknob and her body angled in such a way that she could have slammed the door shut right on his face.Grandpa, Philippa and Dorcas sat at the table with tea. Philippa's shoulders drooped as she warmed her hands on the tea cup. Lupin kept quiet vigil with his arms crossed pacing in the small kitchen."What did he look like again?" He repeated.Dorcas didn't like the way Philippa looked."That's enough questions for the evening. May I please speak with you in private?"Dorcas's chair scraped the floor that startled none of them. She pulled him into the hallway and glanced over her shoulder to see that Philippa still hadn't moved. She was watching her tea get cold. Grandpa nearly oblivious to the entire scene with a faint smile on his quiet old, sweet face. She turned around completely and told her friend she would be right here, just off to the side and that, in fact, since it was so late that she would spend the night. Lupin started to make an objection and stopped himself. He too, would spend the night. If Dorcas had still been sitting across from her Philippa, she would have seen her close her eyes. From where they stood, Lupin could see past Dorcas's shoulder. Phillipa exhaled deeply, wrapped her hands around the teacup and brought it to her lips to drink.Philippa trusted her friend then and honored what she had been told. She let the man into her house because he had called her by her real name. He sat at the kitchen table and she made him tea. She would be getting the news finally of what had happened or at least confirmation for what she knew, what she had known all along."Your friend, she's gone. She has died".She knew that. She had not been prepared to finally have those words spoken out loud by a stranger but, she knew. The man was a little confused to notice her reaction.Still, she said, a sense of formality in her tone "Thank you for letting me know".He had understood that they had been very close. He decided against telling her what had happened unless she asked. She decided that she did not need to know the details. When it had happened, how. It was all the same now."Your home is very cozy." The man said looking around the flat."It is." She said looking directly at him.It was time for him to go but there was something bothering him and she could tell, maybe he wanted to tell her more. She could tell he was determining what to say and how to say it even as he started speaking ."I don't want to know".He smiled more to himself. "I don't want to give you any more information than you would like to know or that would take away your peace.""Thank you.""If I could ask you? I would like to know one thing."That evening when she had been sent away, she had been given a long list of instructions. Her going away bag was now several times smaller than when she had packed it herself. She was given instructions on who she could and could not and should not speak to and how to tell all of these people apart but not when the danger would pass. She was not told when and how she would know when the threat lifted and when she could go home or if she ever could. She knew that this was for her own safety. She had reasoned that maybe she would be told by one of these many people. But she knew also that if anything were to ever happen to Dorcas… She understood people's priorities. She understood that she may not be one of those priorities with her friend gone. Many people had however tried to find Philippa precisely for that reason, because they were friends. As it turned out many more people considered Dorcas a friend and that they too honored their friend's instructions.

Dorcas woke up with a series of knots on the right side of her neck. She had seen a man crack his skull during whichever series of spells that had been cast in his direction. Part of a wall had been torn down and trapped others underneath it and, this time, Alastor had not been there to hold it up. She had seen people die before but not like this. Not this many people at once. No one seemed nearly as disturbed as she felt. She pictured the man falling and that she could hear him even if she would have been too far. The sound of his head hitting the floor. She heard it. Her memory had the right noise at the right place. And the number of people under the wall- She decided fairly early in her training to do more harm than good and this confirmed that choice. She could not live with the idea that she could be so cavalier, so unintentional with her magic. That she would send a spell flying off and hurt someone that way and she didn't have to because she had not. The man floated in the air and Emmeline let him fall. She was already onto the next spell, the next person. It was only the spell that Dorcas cast too late and that someone on the man's side caught his foot and angled his body so he fell with the top of his spine and head hitting the floor first not from a great height but was loud enough for Dorcas to hear from across the hall.Dorcas went downstairs to find Emmeline eating a jam sandwich and speaking with Edgar at the table."Morning." Chipper as she could manage, as if nothing had happened."Sleep well did you?" Edgar asked over a plate of late breakfast."Not really." Dorcas admitted. The color of the jam made Dorcas crane her neck."It will get better," he said. He nodded to emphasize as if her expression had betrayed her. It had. He was talking about the crick in her neck.He had never experienced this but he saw it in other people. Same with Emmeline. She didn't think ill of Dorcas, though she didn't like her, or even that she wasn't a fighter, she was, she saw it but she worked too much on the defensive. The people they were fighting called for offensive strategy, to be proactive and to approach each event with the same and equal amount of energy, as she had said during a briefing. Dorcas thought the word she had meant to use was violence. She didn't approach to hurt anyone, Emmeline claimed when one of these briefings had devolved, as they more recently had, into loud shouting matches. Sirius and her at each others throats. Sirius being the only one who disliked her for the same aristocratic upbringing that he himself had. Emmeline insisted that the point was always to disarm or slow down the opposing side but Dorcas witnessed as much "energy" from her as anyone else. She witnessed a man lose consciousness, his coat collar squeezing at his neck, blocking his inability to say the counterspell to let him loose. A piece of window flying at a foul speed lodged in someone's chest that insisted, by magic, that it make it through to the other side of this body which it did until it sought out another and then another. Then this. This one. Dorcas craned her neck mashing at her shoulder. Edgar gazed at her and felt a deep affection for Dorcas. She really was sweet. He continued to look at her standing there, her very obvious desire to just be around other people as a distraction while she gazed into the air not paying attention to anything in particular still trying to fix the soreness in her neck and her neck getting more sore for her trouble. He went back to his meal, smiling at his food. Emmeline caught him looking at her. It was a second. It was nothing really. He looked up, smiled and returned to his food smiling even harder."Your neck, is it alright?" Dorcas didn't answer. They both looked at her."Dorcas," Emmeline said irritated. Edgar looked at her.She really could be like this sometimes. He knew that and made a type of peace with it. Dorcas looked at them, Emmeline's eyebrows raised in inquisition. Had they said something? She couldn't have told you what it was or how long she'd been standing there."Your neck, Dorcas?" Emmeline must have repeated the question. Dorcas nodded and walked away realizing she hadn't actually said anything."I'm going to lay down." She smiled in an absent-minded way.Dorcas bumped into a wall on her way back up the stairs where she went straight to the bathroom. From downstairs, they could hear the sound of the water heater creaking to life refilling the pipes that would fill the tub. After what felt like an hour, Edgar eating slower than usual to not have to meet Emmeline's gaze, the faucet went off. Upstairs the tub had been expanded in several direction so that Dorcas could submerge herself and stare through several inches of water above her.His plate cleared, nearly licked clean, he looked at Emmeline saddened. And she knew what it meant, what it could mean, that sappy puppy look. Which was absurd! This tall, huge-shouldered, muscular man really had some nerve to allow his face to ever attempt to look like anyone's baby anything! That wouldn't work! Anyway, Dorcas was a damn goody-two robes. She wouldn't dare in a million years and for all the world. Emmeline had half a mind to call her a weakling though she knew it wasn't true. She understood why Alastor and Dorcas got along, they would stop a battle to help the helpless, block or rebound a spell before casting one of their own (she knew that to block a spell one would have to be cast but that was not the point).Emmeline's mind raced. Churned. Dorcas really hadn't even looked at Edgar like that. She had barely noticed either of them and Edgar's smile had no effect on Dorcas the way it did on h-. Hmm, she thought. Dorcas wouldn't but he very much would. How did she know that? She wondered. She snorted to herself. She looked up to catch him glancing up at her and smiling sweetly and it made her sick and angry."Why don't you check on her in the bath? Ask if you can rub her shoulders?" she questioned. His smile widened one side then the other."Why would I do that knowing how angry it would make you, my love? Why don't I rub your back instead?" he said in between clearing the table, raising his eyebrows in a rhythm. It made her angrier. He really thinks he is so adorable."She's not my type." Edgar said facing the sink, his back turned to Emmeline while he waved his wand to start doing the dishes."Which is?" Lies from Merlin's dusty beard! She wanted to see his face when he said that."Kind, sweet, easily disturbed…""She's a mouse." Emmeline snapped loudly. Dorcas didn't hear her, underwater as she was. Alastor hadn't heard her, on watch as he was. Alice Longbottom, didn't care as pregnant as she felt. Her husband didn't mind as smitten with Alice as he was. Lupin didn't either, sleeping as he was. Sirius had already woken up but planned on insisting on telling her later to not wake the house when she knew how busy it had been for all of them the evening before ready to argue as he was.Edgar's chuckle caught him off guard. A dish plopped back into the soapy water in the sink. She really was angry. He turned and walked to the table, kissed her on the cheek.He wouldn't dare."I wouldn't dare." he said lowering his voice in earnest and in contrast to Emmeline's voice moments before.He couldn't. Dorcas didn't look at him twice and she was very easily disturbed, that was true, and his hands were tied, Emmeline made sure of that. Truth was, Dorcas was very much his type but the position had been filled. Emmeline, too, was his type and, well, she wasn't going anywhere and wouldn't let him act up any more than he did. Emmeline would keep him honest, so to speak and they both left the matter at the table and when he said he wouldn't dare, she knew he was telling the truth because for as much as a mouse as she believed Dorcas to be, she knew and saw the day before that she wasn't stupid and, even worse, that Dorcas, fortunately or unfortunately for Emmeline, wasn't at all that desperate.

He had seen something like this before. Lord Voldemort paced around the room still heated by the fire on the hearth. He was always slightly chilled now. His body temperature needing greater warmth even as his disciples used all sorts of magic to prevent themselves from sweating, to keep themselves composed under the literal heat. That didn't matter so much now. Some of these people could not feel the cold or the heat anymore and would not feel it, or anything else, ever again. He had been angry that time and he somehow contained his anger but what he felt now passed out of time and collected into a deadly rage. I cannot tell you how angry or what the color of it was but the general shape looked like many bodies on the floor. Very many. He had let them fall and fall and fall.***He had had to see this for himself. He had paced around the hall as he did this room surveying the wreckage. This one folded under him or herself, this one's bone sticking out of there. Someone would clean it up and it wouldn't be him. He had scrubbed enough floors in his time and coupled with this smell? He hated this smell. That was the worst of all. He could barely think when he first walked in with Bellatrix, Severus and Rozier. It took seeing what happened to refocus his thoughts. This one on the floor with his brains blown out of the back of his head jammy and stinking. There was tile piled on one side of the room. Dorcas had made the floor move under them. Lord Voldemort smiled to himself. They might have slipped, become disoriented but someone had killed this one on the floor on purpose. Who was he? He sustained a low murmur that the four of them ignored. He wasn't dead then? People like this man were making him look bad! What business did this nameless nobody have in this fight in the first place? It could have been anyone responsible for the dozen or so people later pulled out of this hall with its tall ceilings out of the rubble. The muggles' families would have to be alerted. A release for the muggle news. Dorcas had created an environment in which to do all of this. That's what they thought at least. Lord Voldemort knew better. She was hardly the reason all of these people had died and yet for all of this chaos, he recognized that she threatened his plans. That incident earlier had probably made her sick and to the best of his knowledge she had never done anything like it before and had not since. He had ordered that she be brought in then. Yet not one of all the people he had sent on his direct orders had come back with her. He had heard her name several times before that moment but, until then, had no occasion to remember it until one day, for whatever reason, he did."That name sounds familiar." He thought, mining his memories and accurately placing its previous uses. He kept hearing her name over again. He heard her first described as "Moody's girl", then "the mudblood" which Severus made a grand show of not doing. Ha! So dramatic. And, very occasionally and briefly, she was referred to by her last name and then finally "the auror". When she died, they had believed the threat had passed. They had even brought out a bottle of a sweet, magical wine from the Malfoy's collection (really, it had most likely come from the Black family as a wedding gift or dowry). Lord Voldemort opened it himself. They believed that he would be happy? What did they think, those who still could, those who were still alive? What did they think would happen?Severus knew from the very first toast that something would happen and he couldn't wait to witness some people getting their due even as he mapped out a plan of protection in his head. His Lordship insisted on opening the ancient bottle of Satiativa. An ancient vintage. Ancient. This should have tipped them all off but alas. His Lordship had to handle it with a serviette wrapped around the neck of the bottle just so as was tradition, preserving the dust. An empty bottle would cost a small vaults worth of equally ancient currency and he would enjoy the drink immensely. Sip on what only a few wizards could only dream of tasting if they even knew it still existed. It would be a good one. The finest, thinnest stemmed cordial glass appeared in front of each of them at the table. When the cork popped it released not only the pressure in the bottle but the remaining tension in the room. They were safe, they thought, as Lord Voldemort poured into the slightly larger cut glassware in front of himself. The glasses around the table filled simultaneously. He set the bottle down gently. The auror is dead. Dorcas Meadowes is dead. Finally. Severus could feel everything and everyone around him, the relief. He learned long ago that this was a sham of a feeling. He learned a long time ago that an exhalation is done in private, that someone is only safe if they are asleep and sometimes not even then. How do you really know if someone is asleep? How do you know if they aren't just playing dead? Lord Voldemort lifted his glass and all in attendance lifted their glasses in unison. Some people were smiling. Some had tears in their eyes. Joy? Severus looked up at Lord Voldemort from his seat on His right. Regulus across from Severus. Bellatrix diagonal from her nephew, same proximity as Severus but on Lord Voldemort's left hand side."A toast!"There it was. There it was! Severus felt what was a largely imperceptible shift in tone, in inflection. He knew that set-up. He personally had done nothing wrong and he knew his Lordship would not do anything to him but there were reflective surfaces in the room. A spell could bounce off of so many polished things here. Some spells could go through another person and his Lordship was nothing if not precise and elegant but Severus heard it, he felt it. He saw it in his Lordship, he heard it in those two words. Severus could drop under the table and start incantations if he needed to and would explain it away later. But now, he would wait. He would know the time to move. He always knew the time to move, he was still here after all. Still alive."A toast to…"He was angry and here these sops were smiling, grinning away, elated. Maybe Snape wouldn't hide under the table. He might die happy knowing that these half-wits were stripped of their histories. He might enjoy to watch it."Regulus!"Regulus Black inclined his head slightly and slowly as Lord Voldemort enumerated on the toast. He learned fast, Severus had to credit him for that. It never crossed his mind that he was an excellent teacher. That the gesture was copied as Regulus had seen Severus do it. That the gesture, the body language was all Severus."To Regulus!" They all affirmed.They lifted their glasses to sip. And it was perfect. They didn't, they couldn't make anything like this anymore. Severus went through the list of ingredients in his head as he savored the light, green, sparkling sweetness; the slightly, piney astringency. He would be satisfied with the memory of having tasted something, anything with belbarberries. He went over the process for extracting and stilling the juices as described in an old text. The fermentation taking years and the vintage, theorized to be stable forever if made correctly. If not, it could kill a cast of hippogriff dead with a few drops. Those drops were said, per another primary observational text written during the experiments conducted before the ministry existed, even before the " olde vvitch coda", to be so divine, so transcendent that for centuries there was a time when wizards and witches brewed it incorrectly just to taste, just to try it and it was through this that the plant was harvested to extinction and made the correctly prepared wine (really a potion) so rare and expensive. This also wiped out an estimated tenth of England's wizarding population, a point of history still taught, with gusto, in France.Severus sipped again leaving a remainder and felt the bubbles break up his thoughts and piece them back together in a lighter hue. When he set down his glass again, the goblet portion of the glass filled slowly as did everyone else's at the table according to how much they drank. All of them well-bred, or well-read, enough to know to leave a little left over, that their glass would be refilled from the large bottle at the table if they left a little in their own glasses and when that was gone there would be no more.Severus knew he would not have to scramble under the table like a fool. Regulus now knew that too. He too could now sense the shift in Lord Voldemort's voice as He raised His glass to toast the next person. And from Severus he knew that he would be safe and spared whatever was approaching in the invisible, blood-filled storm cloud conjured by Lord Voldemort's voice if only he just sat quietly and very still.

"Tell her. If anything happens to me".If they weren't direct friends of Dorcas, they were friends of friends of friends who loved the person before them enough to uphold what became a long line of people who needed to pass on the information to a woman named Petal until the line of people became so long that people carrying it did not know or had not been told how important the name was. That calling this woman by this name was crucial information and not a misunderstanding or incidental information. There were a strange number of very skilled, highly trained, over competent wizards and witches who took on the responsibility to find this woman and yet only one had. It was only by coincidence that the man now sitting at her kitchen table had taken it upon himself not out of love for the people around him but as a point of curiosity. Why could they not find this one person? This one person didn't have magic of her own. Or did she? Did she? Why had no one ever considered the possibility? Had they? Yet it was a coincidence, the most common magic, one not under the direct control of wizards, and as unwieldy and unpredictable in the hands of muggles, that he had found her.Alastor knew that Philippa had the portkey now because Dorcas had told him. He was the second person after Lupin who had been told directly to go find Philippa, in case. Dorcas at this time was avoiding Alastor because he needed her to go into hiding for her safety. That was when it started. No, it actually started sooner than that but she was avoiding him because she didn't want to listen to whatever new argument he had come up with in the space of time that she made herself scarce but this was urgent and important. She told him that she didn't want to discuss anything else but what to do if something were to happen to her. You know what Philippa looks like, she knows you. That she had told Lupin also. Find her and tell her.Lupin had been told because Dorcas knew then that he had the skill and that he knew all of England's dark and light places. If Lupin couldn't find her, Alastor would but they couldn't. So Lupin told Peter who he knew also loved Philippa and could be trusted and could fit into small places. Alastor told Edgar and both tried until, well. Edgar had told his sister, Amelia who had also been at the party and knew what she looked like, though hadn't stayed long enough to speak with her. After the death of her brother, she became obsessed with trying to find this woman she barely knew and she also told Emmeline who already knew because, of course she did. Emmeline told Kingsley because she didn't have anyone else to tell and Kingsley told Lydia who had been worried since she had stopped receiving letters from Philippa and had her own recent letters forwarded back to her. So she told Prisha who told Daniel. Lydia also told a ward sister at St. Mungo's and that sister told two other people one of whom was actually a sister of the ward sister. And it was through one of these people that he first heard Philippa's name. And then he too, eventually was asked by both Alastor and Kingsley directly which was strange. He found very many people were looking for this woman and he wanted to know why they couldn't find her. He was very busy collecting memories and trying to find a way to win a war that he believed might be unwinnable but something told him to find out why, that this would reveal something to him or not, and he always listened to this voice. It was this same voice that led him to sit through a radio program about a garden of talking flowers years ago that he found delightful. He had stood and listened to the whole program having caught it near the end and then heard it again and this program was a comfort during a particularly exhausting time in his life and this voice told him to find the name of the program and he had forgotten it.One of these wizards had called the woman before him Dorcas's sister. But Dorcas hadn't any sisters. No brothers. Really, no family to speak of which is what made her good at her job or that's what the rumor was. She had nothing or very little to lose. The woman in front of her being one of them. He had to follow her from work several times. He knew this is where she stayed, he knew that he would have to approach her carefully and as was his way, he spoke to the old channels and also by coincidence and a stroke of luck her old nickname since in another stroke of luck, no one had told him directly to call her Petal. That would have been easy. He didn't like easy. He didn't trust easy. Once a long time ago he thought something could be so simple and it broke what remained of his family and that dovetailed into breaking a lot of other people's homes because of what he thought he understood. Now? There had been a radio playing when he first saw her. She had smiled and hummed along with the tune walking past him from the hospital. She hadn't heard the show in such a long time, neither had he.Philippa would have pretended to be someone else which in fact happened once. He had called her name and she had pretended she was someone else. Dorcas' instructions were simple. If Philippa didn't recognize the person, they were not to be trusted. If they wore these symbols they were not to be trusted. If they spoke this and on and on and on and since their last meeting to now she had forgotten many of the details and was comfortable now to live, to wander, to be. The threat it appears had passed, until he showed up. She hoped the rest of her life wouldn't be this and them forever. But one cannot not know. Or maybe she could ask this man? How he could not know this information, that they weren't sisters, but know what to call her did not cross her mind. She was aware near the end that Dorcas must be powerful. She witnessed someone half bow to her once on their way out and thought this not only excessive but funny until she learned the details. She always wanted to know the details. Not this time. What she did not know was that this man was also powerful. He was even more skilled than his friend and that was the only reason he was there."When did you come back here?" He asked.This man asked a lot of agitating questions. Hadn't he said he just wanted to ask one question? He sounded like a social worker and this irritated her enough to dull some of her fear and its familiarity compelled her to answer. The social workers at the hospital were worn down but they asked questions to understand so they could help. Maybe he was something of a social worker?"Months," This is not the answer the man expected, Philippa could tell."I thought you said you lived in Ireland.""No, thats where I was moved, relocated. I might have been there for only a matter of days before I came back into the country." She avoided using the proper terminology. She was tired.Those days had been very long which accounted for the lapse in her judgement of time. but everyone she was supposed to meet, everyone she encountered did their job. She was fed then moved and then told she could sleep here and move there and take this with you and talk to this person. Days? It had been more than two weeks. Her mind consolidated the time out of necessity. The man asked for more tea and while she had not seen this man take a sip, the cup was empty before she reflexively moved to get more. Instead she stayed seated."I know who you are.""You do?""I don't know exactly, but I know what you might be capable of doing and that you don't need me to get a cup of tea, to have my back turned or anything like that, so even though you don't need to tell me I'd like to know why you're here and to tell you to leave." Everything Philippa said came out in one long sentence.The man smiled, "I'm not here to hurt you." He replied."That's not what I said." Philippa did not smile."I'm here to tell you about your friend""And you have. Yes, i think its time for you to go now.".He bowed his head gently. Philippa noticed his teacup was full again but didn't notice when he had filled it again."I will leave but i would like to know the timeline also. I'm afraid I have not been completely honest with you. You see, many people have tried to find you and tell you and none of them, including me initially, could even find you to let you know. If you have been here all along, I'm trying to understand how this could be." He certainly did work for a social service. The even tone in his voice, his patience. She understood how some of her patients felt during such a soft-tempered interrogation. She wanted to roll her eyes.Philippa considered all of the people trying to find her and couldn't because of some reason or another. All of the potential reasons she could imagine, she wanted their source to go away, to vanish as if by. She wanted to laugh and cry at the same time because of the thought.She took a steady deep inhalation and answered, "I went to Ireland via portkey. I moved around and I came back into the country using the same portkey and moved and moved and moved and lived with someone shortly and that person helped me find a flat, this one where I have been almost two months. There it is." She unloaded this information on the same exhalation out and she felt lighter.Had she said portkey? How? He would investigate later. He could tell she was getting tired. News moved very quickly during a war not all of it was accurate but the fact that Dorcas had been killed was accurate. It was known that Lord Voldemort was looking for Dorcas and had killed her. That was also accurate. Once the news had been discovered, confirmed the Order of the Phoenix was informed, what was left of it, and that news spread through the allied channels and in days maybe a week at the most, someone was looking for Philippa and no one had stopped. There might be someone looking for her right now and she had been in England for months and this flat for weeks at least."Thank you, Ms. Groves." The man said instead.Then she felt it. It felt like a small knock on the door of her mind. She was suddenly in a smaller house on the inside side of the door and she knew the man was standing on the other side and that she could open the door or not. She did not. It was better than last time. At least he knocked, she thought.He had never encountered anything like this. He didn't know muggles could do this at all. He only tried to make his job faster but instead of wandering around in her mind he had encountered a door made out of lead. He had to knock and from his side he saw a little sliding gate with her eyes peering through and she scrutinized him looking him up and down and her eyes registered a type of displeasure or disgust. When the little door was slid shut he found himself back in the kitchen again. Again, he thought, she is not a confirmed muggle. And yet could a muggle also be an occlumens? This was occlumency (wasn't it?) but he had never experienced it this way. And again, he didn't think it on the top layer of his mind but deep down in the wells of knowing himself a little jet that moved the currents of who he was. You can't even tell if she's a witch or a muggle. You recognize a part and not the whole. You need more information. Said differently, he appreciated that this would not be easy. Reading her thoughts would have been easy. He understood something else that day about people and, though small, he would add it to the small ball of hate he nurtured for himself that he watered occasionally in the hopes of growing a garden of sorts. Instead, and someday soon he knew, it would melt into sludge that would coat every corner of his life until he couldn't live with himself or the war ate them all whole. Sludgey corners and all."It's time for you to go now."Did she understand what had happened, he wondered?"Good day Mr.-" she said as she got up from the table. She did not know his name. He had in fact told her while she was walking in but she did not remember it nervous yet reassured as she was."Albus. Dumbledore." The man said getting up from the table. Outstretching a hand that she did not take.Not these ridiculous names again, thought Philippa. She wouldn't let herself be bothered by what had just not happened. She needed to get him out of the house and he knew that. He dropped his hand and took no offense to this knowing what he had tried and failed to do and also feeling no shame in having tried."Ms. Meadowes, she was very talented. A very good witch. Dorcas was an excellent witch."They were at the door now. Philippa had not been prepared to hear Dorcas' name in past tense. That is what hit her. That's what drew the tears to her eyes and set them sparkling in her face. And the witch part, she did not care one way or another."She, she valued friendship and goodness. She. Thank you." Philippa opened the door."Thank you for everything you've told me today, Ms. Groves. Would you like me to visit again?""That won't be necessary Mr.- Sorry, what was it?""No need to apologize. Albus." He said as he surveyed the door frame slightly distracted. He turned on the other side and smiled a thinned, wan smile. He tipped a hat on his head that Philippa hadn't notced him carrying. He lighted down the steps looking both ways as he crossed the street with his long legs, like a determined spider. He did look back over his shoulder a glance at the building and not at her, the smile was gone replaced by the look of concern and intensity he had while studying the door. She watched him walk in the direction of the hospital until he was part of the crowd and she stood there closing the door gently behind her."No one could find you." She had been protected all along and felt some frustration which would come later in feeling that she had wasted all that time afraid for nothing.It seemed unfair that someone could bring that much sadness into a room, into a house and then leave without looking over their shoulder at her. She understood she told him not to come back but he could have asked, en route, out of the door, "are you okay with all of that?" Even if he hadn't waited for the answer. Maybe he wasn't a social worker after all.Philippa opened a small door in the kitchen and shut the door behind her she pushed on a wall and it opened up silent to another small hall which she crawled into. She went down this hall and opened up to the space between the flats. This space had originally been used as a space to get to the outside windows easier for cleaning. It had been repurposed during a war to keep the neighbors of the flat in communication and access to each others homes to hide in if there were raids. The landlady, Robin would have told her this if Philippa had asked. Philippa went up a steep flight of steps and knocked on a door even smaller than the one she'd gone through. She opened the door to a furnished space. She went through the flat and down a flight of carpeted steps where she ran into her landlady, the person she wanted to speak with. This was not an emergency but she really needed someone to talk to.

"A man visited me today." The old woman's body froze."No, I'm fine. I mean. He came to tell me that my friend. My friend has died." The woman relaxed and also saddened reached over to hold the younger woman's hands in her own."I'm so sorry.""I knew but someone just came with the news. This was the emergency.""How?"The old woman's face betrayed the question and so reflexive is this question that Philippa heard it though the woman did not speak the words. It's so strange that people ask this and yet she wanted to know. We all always want to know.Philippa doubled over. "Peacefully. Quietly." She chanted to herself. Maybe there was magic there, too. Maybe by saying it enough times, it would be true. Philippa hoped it was. She wanted to say Dorcas died in her sleep. She died an even older woman than you but really she knew. If Dorcas lived as an auror, as a member of the Order maybe it wasn't peaceful but, it was good enough to think it had been. That's not what the old woman had meant. That's not the "how" the old woman was asking. Robin meant how did Philippa know her friend was gone. But not only did she not press the matter further, Robin let the young woman cry silently.Philippa felt something had lifted but, for all the feeling of lightness and sadness and resignation, her feet carried her past her flat and as far away in the opposite direction that the man had gone. She would not and did not think about Dorcas or the man or the news he brought or anything else. When she was ready and after her walk, she would return home as she had.Philippa would never say in her head what Dorcas was which became easier and easier as the old, sad parts began to break up and evaporate and leave mostly only the good parts. Philippa lived to be an old woman, past the age of her very old landlady who lived stunningly long for no other reason that she still wanted to be there in case Philippa ever did come back. Philippa would die warm in the comfort of her bed falling into a gentle, deep, dreamless sleep and then falling further into the greatest stillness, her family asleep in the other rooms (and what a full and happy, beautiful family it was). Up to that very moment from the day that she met the man and all through the next war, which she knew involved wizards and magic, aurors, dragons, witches, potions, spells all kept hidden behind the thin veil of what she knew was called the Statute of Secrecy, Philippa would never mention her friend or say Dorcas' name out loud again for the rest of her life.

Phillipa was gone now. Dorcas felt very much alone and had not anticipated how sick she would feel. She had watched a lot of people die in her time. A lot some the direct cause of… that did not matter. Phillipa had been sent away and now, all of it, everything, she felt at once. Dorcas had the strange sensation that she had turned around and someone had thrown the entire weight of the war at her and her reflexive action was to hold her arms out even as she knew it would snap her in half, would kill her. All those people- She understood how serious it was but she hadn't felt it. She had had someone to normalize and even everything out, she couldn't talk about the details but there was her old self, her old life, a tether to who she had been and therefore was and now she knew she was in for it. All of that gone with the whooshing sound followed by the pop of someone traveling by portkey. Now she could feel what it was doing to everyone around her even as she stumbled down the street which was quiet thankfully, mercifully. With every step she could feel the weight of everything get heavier even as the load remained the same. The energy required to move it all, to keep them all safe, all the time as best as she personally could. She had the strange sensation too that she could hear everyone in their home breathing. That as she passed a house she could hear everyone's individual breath and that winded her, from the outside looking at her she appeared as she did a woman going somewhere. She remained as composed as ever but even she walked faster than usual, she had no where to go.She accelerated her pace until she nearly skipped and then you would have seen that this woman needed to get where she was going or she was going to die right there mid-prance. If you were close enough, you would have seen her sweat and what exactly was she looking for? Was she being chased, who was chasing her? And oh, God. What's wrong with her? She wasn't crying in the familiar sense of the word, her eyes were full of tears, her face was covered in tears, and her hand over her heart. She was going to die. Dorcas could hear the breathing in the houses and her own breath and felt like she sat in the mouth of an enormous city-sized animal, warm and damp and alive. All of that training, all of those fights and the many more she had assumed would come would be for nothing. The thing that killed her would be saying goodbye to Phillipa. Fitting, she found it. There was a space between two homes where this neighborhood used to have gardens, before they started fitting houses in between the spaces of other houses. It was insignificant but so were the insides of the new constructions. Compared to the houses it sat next to it looked like it had been made a clearing instead of the clearing it naturally was and so small scraps found its way into this space. She exchanged one hand for the one over her heart trying to keep whatever was falling out of her soul in. She steadied herself against the bricking that separated the space before taking out her wand and tapping it against the wall and throwing a spell above her head moving her arm in one fluid motion above her. The air rippled and a small, gentle wave of air flowed above her head. The natural conclusion of that gesture ended with her letting go of her wand and it landing a short distance in front of her hand and her body falling, collapsing a little bit behind it.Dorca woke up what felt like days later which had in fact only been a few short hours, if that. Panicking she found herself reach for her pockets. There it was on the ground where it had remained, she reached for her wand remembering how and why she was there. She rolled over enough to tuck it back into her jacket without bothering to check the defenses she had set up or establish new ones. The weight now sat on her back and she found it difficult and pointless to move. What did it matter now? When had it ever mattered? She had failed in stopping everything up to this point and most likely would continue to fail. She had not considered what it would mean for her to lose certain things and now they were lost anyway even if she had. She could not have fought harder, the Order could not have fought harder, Lord Voldemort could not have been less cruel, and if it had worked then it might be another her in a different time or place doing the same thing at that very moment. Defeated. But she did not consider any of this once she could feel her wand against her ribcage as uncomfortable as it was, and almost without changing her body position from how she laid when she collapsed, she moved her left arm slightly under her head to shield her face against the grass and weeds blinked at the wall in front of her ignoring the tears streaming down her face and, closing her eyes, she decided to die but, instead just fell back asleep.***In the house to the right of this little field lived a couple. One of that couple was out on business and that left the bed deliciously wide and cozy. They loved each other yet when he woke up to go to the bathroom, he recognized in a sleepy way, for all that love that people, including his wife, should have the good fortune of sleeping alone in a big bed knowing that someone somewhere still loves them. At the very moment hundreds of miles away, the woman this man married woke up instinctively realized he wasn't there to wake her up at this very time, stretched like a big cat and fell back to sleep smiling. The man in his half sleep went to the window drawn as he was like all life to the light and looked out onto what could have been a garden below and smarted. The small space, littered with scraps of paper and overgrown slightly with weeds and native soft grass was still dark. The day had not made it to the spot yet even as the sun was still sliding up higher into the sky. It was if the whole lot was still in darkness, still stuck in the night and, it too, was waking up. He did not communicate it to himself but he perceived a strange sensation that it was also underwater. That he was staring at the bottom of the dark lot submersed in an exceptionally clear pool of water. He went to the bathroom as if nothing odd had happened. "Still tired", he thought to himself as awake as he was. When he returned he went back to the window and looked at the lot again. He breathed a sigh of relief. This time the space appeared as it always had when he woke up, that he really must have slept so well that he had imagined it. A nervousness, a tenseness that he didn't realize was building up in his body evaporated with the sigh. The sun was even higher and the day about to start but he could manage an hour more of sleep. So odd how quickly the day started. How fast the sun could move so you barely noticed it rising or setting. He got back in bed. Chuckling to himself at how silly he was to have even imagined such a thing. He managed to get back to sleep and would be greeted by the movement of the neighborhood but found that the bed was suddenly too big for him to enjoy. He would not have noticed a well dressed woman with her hands shoved deep into her pockets making her way to no place in particular because the window did not face that direction. He would not have thought the two in any way related: the lot at night in the day and the woman. Why would they have been related at all? He had merely imagined the former after all.

Alastor had stopped crying years ago. Dorcas mentioned that they were just rumors. Just rumors of what Alastor and his class had done, she didn't give any details but she didn't have to. She knew. All the aurors knew. This was before it became a reputable profession. It was during the old wars. Alastor soaked in the tub and felt like he had the misfortune of being born during so many wars, always a war going on until he was old enough to fight in them himself. Dorcas didn't have to give any more details because even if she didn't know details she could sketch out in her mind what those rumors meant based on the horrors of her own auror training. They had done terrible, terrible truly awful things in his time. They had been taught a different style, a more forward way, a quicker way. A lot of people had to pay for that training including him. The good guys. He couldn't cry now. He dried out.That's what they had called it once the nightmares started, once the old dogs started speaking and he found out that he wasn't the only one who woke up screaming or crying or back there where they didn't belong or with this person or in this coffin or. They had called it drying out when they started to lose sensation, a sense of feeling like what a normal person should feel like in certain situations. Joy at a child's birthday, fear for one's life looking down from a broom. Affection, tenderness, sadness, anger, all gone, just husk now. He thought that was funny and yet he still did feel and just couldn't or wouldn't cry. Remus had told him that he had buried the body. She was now safe and Alastor would stay grateful for Remus' kind gesture until he died. It would have been his undoing, believing, knowing that she was gone because of him. That's what Dorcas had said. She said she would never forgive Alastor. Never forgive him for saying the words, that combination of sounds that unlocked the one reason she would go into hiding in the first place. He had racked his mind over how to get her to safety. It crossed his mind to send a mark over her house but he hadn't had to and was also thankful that he hadn't told anyone about his plan though someone else had the idea.Maybe he should have, if he had been the one to do it, she would have traveled to the other side of the world to get away from him. She would never speak to him but she would be alive and far away and safe. Now she was close and safe but not alive. Anyway. Anyway. Her home smelled clean and cold and he wasn't the romantic romantic, sentimental type which made him and her and all excellent aurors good at their job. He remembers that he sat on the edge of her bed and looked around and successfully blocked one of the last moments they had been together. Initially he told her "go for yourself" for your own safety." What a foolish choice of words and this he smiled at, she was too tired to find this funny at the time. The mark, her friend, the everything, she was just too tired. The mark is what really set her off though. There was so much miscommunication all the time. He marveled in every instance how quickly she had found out and the chaos that a misinterpretation could cause. Dorcas mind finally cracked under the weight. She was a real auror now. She would have been unstoppable if she hadn't been stopped. He could remember vaguely from training how to tell the last spells on a wand but had asked Lydia to find someone at the ministry to do it. He would send an owl to meet in a candy shop in Diagon Ally and this young man, this child, he thought, knew enough wandlore to assess in the broadest way what had happened.There were deflections, protections and a rarely used and inconsistent deflection. Used once, followed by defenses and then nothing. Alastor had asked what the one meant. She had not attempted to kill him. You couldn't tell the speed in which the spells cast anyway but after the last deflection? Nothing. He brought back her wand and after learning what happened, after learning what really happened and leaning also that the wandlore was so difficult to interpret because it ultimately didn't matter. He had learned too late, as he was going to her that she was already going, going, going somewhere else where no magic could bring her back. He had kissed her once on the forehead and he wasn't sentimental. He blocked the idea of wrapping his arms around her of telling her how proud he was of her, of taking her face in his hands again and kissing her again. On the forehead. And hugging her again and telling her again that he was proud of her and looping on itself until he got old and died first as it should have been. Safety. What had he been thinking?***The words that sent her away were "do it for me". They brought tears to Dorcas' eyes. He had seen her angry and sad and scared that and this went beyond that because she folded inwards and he saw in her face many very heavy doors shut and lock after he said them. He should not have said those words and she said she would never forgive him for saying them. That's what she had said the last time they had spoken. That was the last thing she ever said to him. And he was ok with that but she was right. Surprise.It was an old dramatic thing to do, burning someone else's wand, burning a colleague's wand. You would think with all that magic, with all the life tethered to it and all the memory it held that there would be a spark of color a sparkle, a shimmer, something to say: I acted as an extension of this person. He thought for a moment, he let himself believe that hers would turn into a bouquet of flowers like a muggle magic trick. HA. That burning it would swing a door open somewhere and she would walk in and let him kiss her and hold her and that together they would find the incantations, the ingredients to rewind everything so that when she was born she entered a world where there was no war, no job, no him. The wand was laid over kindling, some parchment, and under a log. He thought to do this in her own place but it wasn't after all, her place, not anymore. He did it at headquarters alone in the middle of the night when people were either on duty or awake pacing in their rooms or sleeping if they could anymore. He stopped himself from saying sorry in his mind. He touched the edge of his wand to the kindling and watched as the wand caught on fire and burned like everything else in the fireplace. It too, after all, was mostly wood.

The party went swimmingly. Several people showed up early to make preparations and, as should have been assumed, everyone fell as in love with Philippa as they already were with Dorcas. As they should have, as was the natural order. They were extensions of one another and what they admired in one was magnified in the other. When Philippa was cornered to discuss one topic they found that Dorcas could expand on it. When one could be found singing a song in one room, the other would catch the same song at a different point in another, completely separated from each other. That Dorcas had worried about Philippa not having her own friends there was of no importance to anyone including Philippa herself. It was she who had initiated their friendship so long ago noticing the relationship between their names and, with Dorcas' friends too, she made it so that everyone felt that they had been friends all along which they had been through this same person that she loved.The walls were sound proofed unbeknownst to Dorcas at the time which she realized after stepping out to get some air and greet the next visitors. She walked through her own fire gate and didn't understand the implications of that but it did not affect anything she didn't think. With the door closed behind her the evening was as still as it was without a party of drunk wizard adults weren't hosting a birthday party during a war. When the door swung open again and sound flooded out and it seemed even louder than it was for the contrast. Trays of food floated throughout the house and there were several types of different lubricating beverages bobbing in the air being passed from one guest to the next. Someone burped out a small ball of fire, Philippa made a note to stay away from anything that wasn't water from the tap unsure if she witnessed what happened accurately or was starting to hallucinate because of whatever she herself had drank earlier.Dorcas was now on the couch covered in a blanket with Philippa at the other end, their legs tangled together keeping each other warm. The Pruitts were sitting on the floor playing cards with Basil. In the corner, Remus danced with a bottle of something clutched in one hand to his chest, singing. The festivities were winding down, people discussed at the kitchen table. One or several or more people passed out in grandpa's old room, several more walking downstairs to say good evening. Remus looked like he would start crying as he sang louder and louder, singing now almost to howling. Philippa heard a chair in the kitchen scrape the floor and watched as Sirius bound into the room."Steady old boy" she thought he said to Remus. Sirius pat his friend on the shoulder and pulled Remus in until it looked like they were slow-dancing. Remus head tucked into Sirius neck. Sirius right hand on the back of Remus' neck. Philippa watched silently as the party swirled quietly around them all. No one having noticed anything. It looked like Sirius was whispering something in Remus' ear. Remus shook his head and, as close as they still were, they looked at each other Sirius still speaking him his hand still warming the back of Remus neck, he shook his head again and handed Sirius the bottle and sat on the single, well-worn seat sinking. His hand covering part of his face. Sirius had gone back into the kitchen and came back with a glass of water after reaching out. Remus took the glass and drank, set it on the small table next to the seat and Sirius made himself comfortable sitting on the floor which would have made Emmeline laugh out loud. As posh as he was? Sitting on the floor?! But she had left in a flurry much earlier and Remus, who was leaned back with his eyes closed would just have to explain later as he said he would. In the meantime, Dorcas would know, surely. A peel of laughter errupted from the kitchen and Sirius looked up smiling in their direction but stayed where he was. He leaned against the seat where Remus was now sleeping and surveyed the party, lost in his own thought."Dodie", Philippa whispered louder than she thought since she was still tipsy. She motioned from the couch towards Sirius. Dorcas turned to look at a scene that was so plain, so benign that she wasn't sure she was even looking at the right place."Is that because he's a-", Dorcas eyes widened and her hands flew to her face in a gesture that was supposed to mean "shh" but came out as a flailing because Dorcas was also tipsy.Fabian, looked up from his card game and glanced in the direction of Sirius and Remus having only caught a glimpse of whatever it was that was going on in the corner in the room, far more invested in the card game before him."Homosexual?" he answered. He went back to his card game. "Likely, I think."Dorcas shoulders dropped in relief. No one else looked up from the card game and Philippa who thought she was being very quiet before and wasn't thought she was being very loud now laughing behind her hands and making no sound at all watching the range of emotion play out on Dorcas' face.It hadn't crossed her mind. She turned to Dorcas and she mouthed."I thought you said he might…"Dorcas shook her head wide-eyed again but smiling. Philippa shrugged still smiling. He was really close to Sirius' neck. It seemed dangerous especially if no one else knew which apparently they didn't. She should probably tell someone who cared, the man with the speech. What was his name again? He'd brought a gift! How thoughtful! She would tell him when he came back. Your neck, be careful! Her thoughts crashed over each other funny and serious at the same time. Mostly funny. She thought about all of this moving Dorcas legs' out of the way to snuggle under the blanket more. She's being dramatic, she could have moved her legs over. Dorcas was smiling, being a troublemaker. She had always said Philippa was a finicky sleeper and blanket thief. Philippa shook her head and pulled the blanket up by her own neck leaning into the cushion behind her. I will tell him when he gets back I don't care what she says. Both of them smiling at each other and trying not to burst into fits of laughter."Happy birthday, Petal." Dorcas mouthed.Philippa shook her head she would tell him alright. She snuggled into the couch forgetting about the gift first, then the what it was she should be telling anyone and then who she should be telling it to."Happy birthday, Tulip."The last thing she could think about was the weight and warmth of her friends legs over hers and that this had been a wonderful birthday, probably the best one yet and she closed her eyes thinking that it would be awful to clean it up in the morning and that she would ask Dorcas to use magic to do it. That would be her birthday gift to her but what would she give her? M watched her friend nod off lifting her head at irregular intervals when she thought of something else. She had always been like this, she fought sleep so hard. Even as she was the better sleeper. Philippa yawned watching the men play at the table and looked over in time to catch Remus and Sirius talking to one another Remus eyes still closed but making Sirius laugh all the same. Another burst of laughter broke from the kitchen and they all turned instinctively. A glass of something spilled and no one seemed to notice except Philippa who yawned again and told herself she would clean it up in the morning. She watched the drip, drip of the wine off the corner of the table until she fell asleep.Dorcas thought that, yes, this one. This one was our best birthday yet. What was I even worried about? And she too was lulled to sleep by the sound of ambient joy surrounding her and because of how they were sleeping on the couch, she did not notice the spill at all otherwise she would have been kept awake wondering if she should wake her friend to clean up the mess.

All day she felt a pressure in her abdomen as she dug around in the garden and painted the sides of the cottage a cheery, pastel yellow. When she finally went to lay down in bed, she felt that the feeling had grown slightly more pronounced and as she drift off to sleep she mindlessly felt around her belly button and felt a little nub. This did not startle her. She mindlessly thumbed at the growth until it was no longer a nub at all but that it had grown to a thin spiked tip that had grown out and onto the flat of her stomach. Through all of this she remained unfrightened and over the course of several days Dorcas lay in bed with her shirt slightly lifted as she watched whatever it was burning an amber glow, crawl against her stomach until it grew tall enough to lift its open end up as if it had asked a question and received a difficult answer. It grew taller and taller, winding its way in the air until it reached the window sill directly above her bed. It curlicued gracefully up, made itself into something like a fist and knocked gently at the window uncurled itself and as if it had a small face turned to her again and thought it didn't have a face, Dorcas could sense that it smiled.When Dorcas woke up she found herself lying on her back. She reached for the vine made of light that had started in her stomach and, of course, found nothing. She sat very still, got her wand and with her back against the wall she moved the drapes covering the window. She inched closer to look out, wand at the ready to find that it was raining outside. The world in a late midday, she could barely make out the forms outside of the window but the light streaming through cast a honeyed, green tinge through the gloom as if the trees were breathing all of their color out.She realized then that she had been in the house for weeks at least and that she had not remembered the last time the windows were opened or what the ground looked like when she arrived or even what time of year it could be with all this rain. The clean air rushed in as she opened the window and she felt renewed and saddened. She would die here. She decided to leave the cottage for the first time since her arrival. The door swung inward and left a small puddle from the door on the floor. She left the door open, the rain making its way in as she put on a jumper and wrapped a blanket around her neck as a scarf even if it she wasn't that cold, it smelled like home.The door shut behind her and after casting a spell to keep the rain off for the most part she held her wand in her crossed arms slightly under the makeshift scarf. She stepped gingerly down the steps and onto the slick pavers. Her shoes would be covered in mud and her feet wet once she stepped off of this path and into the forest but once she recognized the likelihood of that, some part of her knew she wouldn't even notice when it happened. Without uncrossing her arms, she cast her patronus under her breath. She perceived a flash of small, white light somewhere but did not check to make sure her patronus was there very high above and behind her. It always was when it was called and this time was no different.She started walking away from the cabin which was still the dark greyish navy of her real awake life and set off to the left. She could go across the entire earth and then step off into the stars to somewhere else and never have to think about anyone she'd ever known or anything she'd ever been or anything forever. As her earlier self knew, she did not notice her shoes get covered in mud. She did not care that her feet were wet. She maneuvered slowly but deliberately through the knot of trees and didn't notice the ground under her change lost as she was in the idea of being nowhere and everywhere at once and if there was a spell for that. She smiled at the thought and walked but stopped when the trees opened up and she reached the edge of the tree line where it opened up to a different earth and she squinted out into the rain at a dark expanse of ocean or a lake or sea, she couldn't tell with all the rain, that she had not known was there all along.

Remus' nose was bleeding. His shirt blood splattered. His ribs were sore after being punched repeatedly and thrown on the ground. Sirius got lucky today. They were sitting on the same log and Remus' face was in Sirius' hand trying not to laugh. Sirius pointed his wand at his friend's face. A cracking sound sounded in the air as Remus flinched away to hold his face trying not to smile as sore as his face was."If you think you feel bad, you should see the other guy." Sirius said. Remus clutched his side stabilizing himself with the hand that he'd just used to hold his nose."I can get you shirt, too." Sirius motioned toward Remus and was brushed away both of them beaten up. Sirius got up from log gingerly. Remus watched him steady himself, ah-ha!"How's your leg?", Remus asked.Sirius looked over his shoulder and affected sternness. He limped away."I just need to stretch it out.", Sirius replied raising his voice even though the stillness of the wood made his voice carry to Lupin.Both of them dissolved into a coughing fit in the cold. Remus got up and found himself steady and stable. He knew Sirius knew himself well enough to know if he needed to magic his wounds away and that the coldness might effect that but he said he was fine.They padded away in the snow in silence away from a small clearing ringed with trees. Not the Whomping Willow but they did their job. Initially, they broke into splinters, one setting off the other but after they tested the barrier throwing a rock, both of them decided against it. Maybe they could just fall to create a boundary? It had been unnecessary. Lupin thought his arrangements with Sirius would end, especially since Sirius spent so much time with the Potters now in anticipation of the baby's arrival. But he kept his promise. Peter had offered but not only would it not be the same, Peter would not be able to stop him if there was a problem. Peter had shown up at first but Lupin and Sirius and Peter all knew and understood the arrangement wouldn't work. It just wouldn't. They had not had to disinvite Peter and Peter hadn't felt the need to explain his no longer being there. This was a long time ago before they found the clearing, before they planted the seeds for these trees and Dorcas taught Lupin how to force a thing to grow. Lupin hadn't explained everything but Dorcas felt inclined to mention that something, even a plant forced to grow before its time would be weaker for it. Lupin had nodded and they sat in silence since Lupin knew that he needed something. There was nothing else he could do for the moment. During the right time, or the wrong time, he could rip through an actual cage so a weakened ring of trees would have to do in the meantime.Lupin felt bad at first. Here Sirius was babysitting, still. Even after school. It had been different then but even now? But it was Sirius who proposed one day that they "meet me at the trees". Lupin knew what that meant though he was confused. There was still a week or so left until the next cycle started, until the tide line would change but he met Sirius in the evening and found a campfire on the edge of the circle. Sirius warmed himself. There was no explanation. He handed Lupin food and they slept under the stars. When they woke up, Sirius pulled his shirt off and Lupin did the same and they were in the middle of the circle as they had before and also not and they wrestled and they boxed and they threw each other on the ground and punched at each other's sides and they had understood when the other was tired. Lupin on one knee panting. Sirius both hands resting on his thighs, staring at each other exhausted. Just too tired to talk as always.Lupin did not want to think about it too deeply but, when he went on long walks, he couldn't help thinking. It felt better to move his body than to sit and think and brood. He thought Sirius, as a man, needed to punch Lupin, as a man, for all that he'd done for him. For all the growling they'd done at each other. For all the times Lupin lifted Sirius bodily over his extended frame and thrown Sirius, howling, across a room, across a forest clearing. Of all the times Sirius had to risk his life to keep Lupin's rages contained. For keeping the world safe from the nights of Lupin cracking his neck and sometimes keeling over and retching or vomiting outright. Of shaking and paling. When Lupin got out of school, that's when he read deeply about his condition. He had never thought to think about what he looked like when he changed but, when he read it finally, for that too. Having to watch the hair on his arms stand up completely straight, to watch his hair get grey… greyer. To watch his eyes turn yellow. But Sirius stayed and they met at the same place or a different place. Lupin tried to talk to him again. Lupin could find another way."Why when this way works?", Sirius replied.Lupin had tried to get indignant and act offended. Sirius was implying that he wasn't smart enough to take care of himself. Sirius eyebrows arched in genuine surprise and then his face resolved. He smirked. That look. Nice try.Lupin didn't think that what Sirius hated was the aftermath of the transformation. When Lupin woke up in a daze and that he looked around even if briefly that he wasn't sure where he was. That he sometimes woke up with tears in his eyes, that the Sirius hated that sunlight and the dawn because it illuminated his friend's expression. Because that is what he hated. He stayed on the edge of the trees. He usually didn't even look, it hurt him to look. It had always hurt him to watch. When he was sure that he was changing back into himself, coming down, he would just turn away most of the time. He tossed Lupin his clothes when he was reasonably sure that he was done, that he was himself. Or rather his other self. Lupin made a distinction and Sirius didn't. It wasn't necessary. Sirius knew both of him and loved him and that's why he was there. If Lupin had said James or Peter needed to be there, had wanted them there, they would have all been there, even James. But Lupin would never. So proud, so melancholy. Anyway, James was busy and Peter couldn't help not in the way that Sirius could. James had tried to breach the subject when Sirius visited. This, too, felt like a long time ago but really wasn't. Sirius ended the conversation. He would go. He would go every time and had.Sirius watched Lupin stretch. Sirius had the same sensation but imagined it was worse for Lupin, like your skin was too tight. That you were more fragile as a man. Lupin put on a long sleeve shirt. He walked like nothing happened though slower or like his trousers were a little too small even as they were kept up with a belt or magic. Once, after Lupin had dressed, he sat back on the ground and cried, his head hung low and shaking back and forth as if someone had asked a question he didn't want to answer. He had pushed Sirius away for the attempt to place his hand on Lupin's shoulder. It was then maybe that Sirius got the idea. They did not fight with each other. He could argue with both James and Peter. Lupin, no. Funny, then, that Lupin felt the same way about Sirius. If Lupin hit him, maybe he would be able to relieve some of the resentment of all of their insistence to make sure he was safe, to make sure he had someone with him, so that he would not always be alone. He was always alone. He would go on long walks. He visited the Potters sure but not the way he did. Not the way Peter did. He didn't live or sleep at headquarters like everyone else. No one knew where he slept. Sirius wondered for so long that it brought him all the way out into the woods and did not find Lupin so went back. He didn't know what else to do or say or think so he told Lupin one day to meet him at the trees. And Lupin did. And Sirius imagined what? Has he thought it through, really? What would he be doing when Lupin punched him or threw him on the ground? Of course he had fought back! What else should he have done? Lupin would have stopped hitting Sirius if Sirius had stopped hitting him. He would not have wrestled him to the ground if Sirius hadn't lunged first. So?And this was the arrangement. It paralleled the other arrangement. Sirius slowed down to let Lupin catch up to him and they walked together. Sirius threw his arm over Lupin's shoulder thumping Lupin on the chest with his open hand, smiling. He knew Lupin felt better. Sirius felt better like he had taken a sip of water to remove a bolus in his throat. He could breath again. Lupin shoved his hands in his pockets and alternated looking directly in front of him or at the ground but knew he could sense Sirius smiling next to him. Lupin looked the opposite direction trying to conceal his own smile, Sirius tripped a little, he was staring at Lupin, his arm still on his shoulder. Lupin didn't budge even as he smiled. He stared straight ahead of him. Sirius looked ahead pleased with himself, pleased with Lupin, pleased with the cleanness of the air. Lupin made no show to shrug him away but his shoulders weren't up to his ears. They walked like that until just before the gesture became ridiculous and excessive.Sirius was still smiling at himself, his cleverness. This was good for both of us he thought. He was paying attention to where he walked now. They could magic themselves out faster but the day was still young. They had nowhere else to be. It was then that Lupin could look over without being noticed. Sirius bit his lip and turned to look at Lupin who was no longer smiling. Lupin looked ahead again and exhaled. Sirius thought this was funny but said nothing.

A word on paranoia: everything becomes related. A straight line can be drawn from this thing that happened that many days ago, to this thing now. Everything takes on the same form, the same weight of other, unrelated events until the mind cracks and is paved over with this residue. Someone knows. Someone is pulling the strings. Someone is making a fool of you, watching and laughing and waiting.The training for this had been the most difficult of anything the aurors learned or practiced and found that that it was difficult for several reasons. People left crying or teary eyed. There were days where a session would leave someone gasping for air. Dorcas was in the first group, the first where their minds were being opened up like a small shell with a big knife, she tried to be mindful when she was in the second group to not make a mess of it herself. But that's not how that works, one can be a mindful but unkind legilimens. One cannot be mindful and use the imperius curse. Especially not the latter because it is an imprinting of one's will on the other. It's not a suggestion; it's an insistence. So outside of training, she had not known that she was unprepared because everyone was so bad at it. They weren't a weak class per se but they were different. That lessons had been odd. It was coincidence that this lesson was moved or had to be changes the expert in this thing called out sick and then there were reschedules… No one had been adequately trained (not like there was adequate training for it) and anyway it was so rare. Most aurors, let alone non-aurors of wizarding England, back then had not even heard of legilemency until they were in training. And one so closely related to a curse? All the unforgivable curses, to do them were so difficult. Even more difficult was to do one quickly. You had to call on all of the foulest parts of yourself and who in all of England could really use the imperius curse elegantly enough to not make it appear as if they weren't using it?They had left training lying to themselves and knowing they were lying to themselves because when it was used on her, when it happened, she had hardly even realized it was happening at all. In fact, with someone who knew what they were doing, it could be quite pleasant. She felt like someone was pouring a warm bucket of water over her head and had a faint, very far away thought that she might have gone to the bathroom on herself. She hadn't, but she wouldn't have known to look down at herself because the thought was already gone. She started to walk and thought how strange it was until she realized she hadn't told herself to walk. When she told herself to stop, she kept walking. It was a very strange sensation, indeed. Some part of her recognized she was and wasn't thinking simultaneously and these thoughts were happening in mere fractions of a second from one another. And where was the panic that she and so many other people had felt in training? Where was the feeling that aided in shaking the other person out of their mind? Where was the feeling? If she could feel it, she could push whoever it was out of her existence. But she wasn't even thinking that, not really, because another dangerous idea started to form, to cement itself. It was easier to let someone think for her. But this was far away still. She felt herself smiling vaguely, dumbly. She kept walking and walking until she was brought face to face with a smiling man with a grey bowler wearing a blueish grey suit, a woman in a smart navy skirt suit at his arm. Dorcas shook his hand and now she could feel the panic. It was the woman in the suit or or the man or both of them or neither of them or. He dropped his voice as they were on a busy street, he gave her information she needed, information she would have willingly gone to collect of her own free will and then information she would not have."Ah, that's why," she said, still smiling."I hope you understand. It was faster this way.", the man said out loud or in her head.The woman stood there looking at and past Dorcas at the same time. Dorcas shook her head as a gesture she would have done naturally anyway. He tipped his hat and they walked off. When her mind was free, the temperature dropped and the wind picked up where it left off, where it had always been though it seemed sudden. Dorcas stood still until it did not make sense to stand there anymore, until it would have been suspicious to stand there any longer. She stood so longer that it would be pointless to feign having dropped something or that she might have missed the bus, she started to walk of her own volition.She hadn't had to think of her training in a long time. What it had taught her and what it obviously hadn't. Until now she had believed to be proficient at occlumency. As the first group gained composure, they were asked to switch. She would be in group B now. She had had to wander around someone else's mind and the familiar roadmap she had built for herself over time was unusable with someone else. These training sessions were familiar and legendary in the worst way. Some people, known legilimens were only allowed ever to work with highly, highly gifted occlumens. But like many gifted people in a new setting, some people learned they too were gifted when given the chance. How many time had the tape deck of other people's minds unspooled in these very same sessions was anyone's incorrect guess. The highest estimation could still have been doubled. All sort of disgusting, horrible things unwound during those sessions with the unspoken rule to never speak of them to anyone else, which made it worse. They were brothers and sisters in training and in the field. They were to defend one another before anyone else, before themselves. If one of them went down, that represented a measurable net decrease in the safety of the wizarding population at any moment and all of humanity in the long run. Whatever you saw in someone else's mind, you did not, even as it became part of your own mind. It was for everyone's own good.

Several classes ahead of Dorcas', one auror stopped speaking to another. They never spoke again because of something that no one else could know about because neither of them would or could speak about it. Unspeakable. Every year someone would get sick all over the floor right there. This had happened every single year and that was hardly the worst thing that happened. What of the aurors who never made it to the field? What of the ones that did not treat other aurors as family? The Ministry believed then as now that this was a risk worth taking. Dorcas felt sick like the dark spaces between the atoms were prodded at with light. It was unnatural for her. She, like many others, quietly put more energy in blocking the spell, developing the counter measure than developing the skill to do legilimency on other people. As a result, in her class, there were very few good enough for them to ever be exceptional at occlumency.After the tutorial and presentation, on their first day on practicals, she thought that being in group B would be easier. It was worse. It made her sick and threw her into a shaking fit and a rash spread under her shirt on her right side on her ribcage. She was rooting in someone else's things like a pig, sniffling and getting herself dirty. They had analogies and other more colorful sayings to illustrate the idea but for the purposes outlined here, it was like having just taken a shower and being asked to put on someone's stinking, dirty, sweaty clothes. Just foul. Just so foul. Even the thought of figuratively having to pull on anyone's sopping wet anything. Every month, at least once a month, they did this and it didn't get easier, though they got better at it. Some better than others. Some learning faster out of necessity or skill. She built other skills around this one knowing this was a weakness, but figured the likelihood of meeting someone like this in battle would take a talent not worth training for anyway. And others too voiced their indignation: If someone could do this, they were most likely a goner. This training was a technicality to be sure. They didn't sign up for this. Who has time to stand staring someone in the face in the field to read the others mind? etc And still every month without warning. Group A: name, name, name and so on. Group B and they knew they would have to do it all again sometimes for days. Until Group A and B assignments, they had to train for field assignments. They studied like never before. They were sent to St. Mungo's. They became used to the idea they might die young. But no one could really communicate the idea that one could stoop so low, not really. The group sessions were just the beginning. To be a powerful occlumens meant to be less vulnerable to the imperius curse. To be less vulnerable meant that you could not be turned into a weapon that used all of the skills of the wizard doing the cursing and the skills of the one being cursed. That an auror's mind was to be protected over the body and they had the death-rate to prove it and as much was said out-loud to no one's surprise.Dorcas would experience the unforgivable curses with the exception of the one obviously but- Again, it hadn't felt so smooth in school when someone told her what to do. There was always an apprehension or a gracelessness and the ability to shake the curse off, so to speak, made too many of them overly confident. Being under the imperius curse wasn't so bad at all! The training department as eager as they were to prioritize one curse, could not bring themselves to adequately teach the other, so people who should have been more afraid when they were sent to apprenticeship weren't. The war was still going on. Aurors and curse breakers were needed to fight and not teach. So as dedicated as everyone was it was all they could do to spare these gifted aurors to lecture first and then host a tutorial and then monitor and correct and coach during a practical and then send these same people off to the field for apprenticeship and then and then and then. Some of the training wasn't as thorough. Some of the checks couldn't be checked again. Everyone's life depended on it but there just wasn't enough time or enough lives.An auror would encounter the curse in the field would recognize, some of them too late, what was happening. One of them, in the class years behind Dorcas, walked clean over a cliff and didn't start screaming until mere seconds before he hit the gr-. Just foul. So foul.She shook again and was back in the room. She turned and saw that one of her colleagues was on the ground face up, slowly blinking away tears. Another was on all fours laughing as if this was the single funniest thing that anyone could ever do. She said that's what helped her break it. This auror felt something warmer, something stronger than she was and she and her brother had this inside joke and she explained it in a convoluted way and she started laughing again to herself, less enthusiastically, but after they had heard it before they couldn't stand to hear her laugh ever again.But whatever she had done, worked. Dorcas went to her after the practical. Teach me to do what you did, she implored. Tell me the story, tell me the joke you and your brother had. But the other auror couldn't conjure up the energy to even cast the spell. The next practical, by the luck of the draw, Dorcas was in the group to cast the curse. She felt her arm glow warm from inside and she felt almost happy and so close to this same auror she had spoken to the day before. Dorcas led her around in straight lines and found how difficult it was to get her to approximate natural movement. Dorcas wondered how people were able to get someone on the floor, to get them to jump. Her arm felt warm still but it became steadily heavier like she was holding up an anvil and not her wand. She no longer felt as happy, in fact when did she become so tired. She just couldn't hold her arm up any longer but she had driven her colleague straight into a wall and she was walking still. Dorcas arm burned now and she felt like she might collapse and so she released the spell letting her arm drop to her side barely keeping her wand pinched between her fingers. And she felt so much better. Dorcas didn't register and might not have even cared that for all of the awkwardness of the other auror's walking, this same person who could untangle herself from the imperius curse less than a day ago, had not been able to do so today. There was no laughter. Her colleague after a startled awakening backed away from the wall and, after a strange but brief delay, reached for her bleeding nose, cursing.Dorcas walked the rest of the way home, she had things to do, could have found things to do and instead of getting on the bus or anywhere she relished walking and stopping and starting again on her own volition. Somewhere she believed she wasn't quite herself and yet there she was. She felt the same smile she had on earlier and didn't change it out of tiredness or out of superstition. In truth, she always had a slight smile on her face. Where Philippa beamed, Dorcas' face said 'hmm, this is nice'. She had just not noticed until, well. There was nothing in her training to help her with this so she walked and walked and built the old walls in her head. She knew it was unlikely to work against the man in the bowler and the woman but Dorcas tried anyway. She started with a brick in a corner and paved it over with mortar. She set another next to it and stacked another brick on top of those layering the joining compound between each. She did not consider this magic even though, in the mind of a witch, it very much was.

Whatever they thought of their sister, their niece really was a sweet and beautiful child what Bellatrix did see and know of her. It was even more unfortunate, Bellatrix thought, that youngest her sister made this old-man, weasel-looking child that she doted on and cooed over. Even more bewildering was that her beautiful baby sister had married so far down. They all had, there was nowhere else to go but down from their last name. At least she married higher up in another country, in someone else's culture. But Narcissa, poor, sweet, and obviously lovedrunk Narcissa married this vain, useless, clueless dolt. The lies she must have told herself to be here, to get to a place where she could sit and really be fascinated by her ugly baby. The lies she must tell herself still. Bellatrix glanced side long at her sister filled with genuine confusion.She had felt nothing on finding out she would be an aunt again and felt only revulsion now. What a short tumble to the relative middle; both of her younger sisters shamed the family name. This child would grow up and look like his rat-faced father. Just a pinched look and countenance, too much slenderness in the proportions. There would be no confusion that he was a Malfoy. What a waste. And yet, in this child's way, he was already doing his mother's side of the family favors.Lord Voldemort seemed, if not cheerier, less volatile. Maybe that wasn't true. He loved Narcissa in his way, even then. He walked in the garden with her, spoke differently to her and Narcissa, for her part engaged and enjoyed, in her own way, their discussions but, they learned this behavior at the feet of their own mother and father. She thought all of them had learned to shield something and store it away and reveal only a silvery civility. Andromeda just turned her coolness towards her own family but the snootiness remained, the poshness remained, the blackness, as ever, remained. She didn't agree with it but she understood it. She didn't like it but could bear it. It was Bellatrix who acted outside of their upbringing.Narcissa rocked Draco back and forth in her arms. She could sense Bellatrix' boredom. She did not get it and did not want to and Narcissa didn't care. If Andromeda had been there, she would have understood. She was a great mother, Narcissa just knew. She missed her sometimes in a way that she knew she was not missed. She knew somewhere that when she married the muggle that what Andromeda meant was that all of their family, including her sisters, meant nothing. This stranger meant more than they did. It did not matter that Andromeda was the one who taught Narcissa magic when she came home from school for the holidays. It did not matter that when Narcissa finally got to school that her sisters, both of them, ensured Narcissa was given preferential treatment because one was so feared and the other so dearly loved. She understood Andromeda and Andromeda understood her and that counted for nothing when she left. Andromeda also understood Bellatrix and in a way that Narcissa had not understood then. She had not understood the seething, clenched teeth rows they could get into. Bella had taught Andromeda to duel in more ways than one. Bellatrix wanted the best for all of them. She would claw her way through anything, put up with nothing so that her baby sisters could live with the protection of her ferocity and discipline. How dare Andromeda throw that back in her face! How dare she throw away her gifts, her brilliance, her beauty, her name?It was not until Narcissa finally sat at the table with all of them that she understood Bellatrix for who she was and what she might have always been. She understood then what it must have meant to carry the burden of your rebellious sister and to watch out for the youngest, sometimes whiny sister. She had worked for them all this time and had nothing to show for it. Narcissa did not know the muggle words but she would have recognized Bellatrix as a general, top brass. Here her focus, her intensity could be put to use for something she believed in if for no other reason that it would benefit her directly, the family name and all the wealth and protections it conferred. It would punish any detractors but Narcissa did not think too deeply about that. If Bella could throw Andromeda away and Andromeda could abandon all of them, she could only trust the family she made. For what it was worth. She placed her hand on her stomach and waited for the introduction she knew was forthcoming. She smiled to herself, to her husband. She answered Lord Voldemort's questions about her pregnancy. She smiled at him, at her sister sitting at his side. She smiled at her cousins Regulus, Evan. She remained gracious to people she attended school with and those she didn't know alike. She nodded and laughed at the right places. Bellatrix was not impressed nor embarrassed but Narcissa could really be a phony. She could really turn on the charm. Pft. They were to start a meeting. She was given the option to remain. She behaved as if she knew nothing, suspected nothing but knew enough to leave. She chose to leave sensing immediately that very few people were ever given the option. There was family at that table. Her sister, her cousins, her husband. She excused herself and the baby she carried with a gentle bow and a warm, sincere smile and walked out of the room without so much as a glance behind her and why should she have?What had they called themselves? Death Eaters? It was meant as a joke, the way it was said, the way they reacted to the name but, if it was the pregnancy, the name or both, it made her stomach turn. It was not until she saw the way her sister looked at him, Lord Voldemort, that she finally understood completely. She would lose both of her sisters, she already lost both of her sisters. It must be difficult to not have an equal, a match. When she met Lucius, she knew. Yes, he was vain, pompous. But he loved her, treated her well and gave her the best of everything he could, which was no small task, but it wasn't like the Malfoy vault was filled with cobwebs. Nor were the Lestrange vaults (plural) and coffers (also plural). Bellatrix had looked bored at her own wedding. And here she sat in between her husband and Lord Voldemort. And while Bellatrix signalled nothing of any great significance, Narcissa sensed the changed. She could see Bellatrix eyes sparkle and she was even lovelier. She, at the very least, respected this man a great deal. Bellatrix would not follow a fool of a man for anything and that would have been enough for Narcissa. She might have followed too but she had seen a small part of what he had done to Bellatrix. Narcissa knew, but not how, that this man, this Lord Voldemort, was not who he said he was. Her own family vouched for this man, all well-bred, good families. He said the right things the right way. He knew the customs. She knew that he must be a quick study but pedigree could not be bought or faked and she would know just as Bellatrix should have also given what she would end up fighting for.It was not long after the first meeting she attended but the light of Narcissa's presence dimmed eventually. Narcissa could not understand why her sister would allow anyone to-nevermind. If she could turn on the charm, she knew Bella could and why she didn't could not be helped now. Whatever the reason was, Narcissa would not be able to talk her older sister out of it. Bellatrix sat silently. The side of her face bled into the collar of her dark purple top and vest and stuck her black hair to her skull. The silk of the vest, like her hair looked only shinier and slightly darker for the wetness. Whatever happened she wouldn't say. Narcissa held a cool cloth up to her sister's face. It took longer than Narcissa thought it would but Bellatrix finally swatted Narcissa's hand away. Narcissa, pregnant and maternal and a little confused and very scared sat with the idea long enough to know that Bellatrix wouldn't dare anything more than that. Narcissa sat with the tea towel knotted in her hands staring forward and let her rage build-up in her heart. She turned, slapped her sister's arm and sighed heavily. She then set the cloth back on Bellatrix' face, gently as ever. She wanted to kiss Bellatrix on her cleaned, throbbing temple but thought better of it. Bellatrix for her part wanted to hold Narcissa's hand but thought the better of it. They weren't children and couldn't or wouldn't protect each other anymore if they ever even could. Bellatrix did not know about Narcissa's walks through the garden and could not imagine that Lord Voldemort could be that way, that he had it in him to be so solicitous. Narcissa did not know what exactly went on at those meetings and did not want to. She did not want to know. She knew it was bad, that her sister carried one hurt from long ago and could amplify it to an extreme and sought out a type of affection that Narcissa found poisonous and destructive even as a child. She had to see for herself after being summoned to the table not too see who Lord Voldemort was but who her sister was. Bella had not had an older sister; Bella had not had herself to protect her.The garden walks with Lord Voldemort would continue, if only to find a way to maneuver gently over time, over the span of her life if she had to. She did not know then what he could be like, she only had ideas. One of those ideas was sitting next to her, bleeding. One of those ideas was her sister. Narcissa patted the towel across her Bellatrix' forehead and did not need to see tears to know that somewhere deep inside Bellatrix was crying. This she discovered much later was uncommon and odd. Other people did not marshal all their hurt, roll it into figurative small plugs and jam them into their own tear ducts. Narcissa wiped Bellatrix' face and held the now warm towel like she was cleaning a delicate and historically significant statue. Bellatrix moved her open hand towards her sister's lap as her sister reached for it without looking and they held hands under Narcissa's big belly. Another generation. If you had seen them from far away, you would have seen two people who looked the same and yet not anything alike and how kind of the one to care for this sick looking, dying one. And on closer look, you would wonder why you thought she was sick at all since she seemed full and vibrant, even striking, and it was in fact the sick one taking care of the healthy one. This might be a rehearsal, a form of mimicry or therapy to reverse roles. You might have thought 'how lovely and strange and sad'.

They always had the same radio static in their heads. There was too much buzzing to bother with so usually he didn't. He just dispensed with it. Them. He dispensed them: their thoughts, the people themselves. He had not been able to clear his own thoughts otherwise he would have done it sooner and he did want to know what the fuss was about. But what had he even done? She was dead. That was her body. That was her wand. Could it have been the wand? She had said nothing of significance had she? He hadn't been listening too closely. Truth be told, he had more important things on his mind. The list of things he had to do grew and shrank with every curse, spell, deflection. It did cross his mind to ask her to join him but that was a passing thought, even whimsical. Her skills were wasted as on becoming an auror. She had chosen the wrong side. The sooner she died, the sooner he could attend to a number of other things. Right now the list was not chiefest amongst his thoughts, it was that insignificant, common wand.He went in for a closer look. Dorcas' wand loosened from her grip and it too, like her, lay still on the ground. Lord Voldemort surveyed the scene. He glanced around and looked at her, then the wand, then her again and the wand again. He stepped closer. He did not understand what had just happened. She had asked him a question, right? What had he said? He felt uneasy at the lack of footing he possessed in the moment and the fury of not knowing started to creep into his mind. It would make his neck muscles tight and weigh him down at the shoulders later but now he could try to understand very quickly what had happened. He stared at the wand. It was insignificant alright but why hadn't he picked it up then? Why hadn't he gone to get it inspected at least? Severus might have assessed it, he certainly could do it himself but that would take too much time and to find out it was worthless? There was nothing in the lore that he could think of that would connect her to anything of any significance even her mythos was contemporary if you could even call it a myth. Give it a year and she would be all but forgotten, he told himself. Sooner than a year. But his walk out through the woods he could not. He could feel himself paving over the memory just by thinking of it. He could not get this exchange out of his mind, first because of its oddity and the confusion it inspired by him. He had not been confused or unsettled by magic in a very long time.He had his back exposed for part of this exchange and she had done nothing. She would not have been able to do anything yet she could have tried. It was not as if she was too principled to cut someone to ribbons, he knew as much. So what was it, what had just happened? He visited old haunts as best as he could gathering information like an invisible, giant, silent magnet. Everything he needed would find its way to him because of the work he had done as a young man. All of his seeds would grow to trees and would bear everlasting fruit to the end of time. He was away longer than he anticipated but everything he needed to check, everything that could be confirmed was safe and in its proper place. He knew he did not have to explain anything and something like gratitude filled the space where his heart should have been. He felt relief that he did not have to lie because he did not have to explain. He could have said anything or nothing and who would question him? Part of the news preceded him anyway. War tended to do this, accelerate the speed in which information traveled. They said he killed her, another layer of information, another layer of the story. He could have gone back to London immediately after and the news would still have raced him and found a way there first.Lord Voldemort had known all along but, to make that clear to himself, to understand what had happened, which he still did not, at least he knew that he had to admit to himself that he had not cast the spell that killed Dorcas Meadowes. He did not know what happened but no one else ever needed to know that. He knew that his accomplishments outweighed the death of one evasive ex-auror. He knew, had convinced himself that whatever had happened did not count for much now since she was dead. He had seen her go down. He knew almost by instinct, or by experience, that her body and the living part of her no longer occupied the same spaces. How that happened was irrelevant. He knew, he was reasonably sure, that she had no quiet skill that would allow her to come back. She was gone. He crossed off her name on the list in his mind.

Several months earlier, The Daily Prophet, Rita Skeeter:A muggle woman who will remain unnamed, went missing from her home in Dorset. The bodies of her two sons, 7 and 11, and husband were found along with the bodies of two unrelated people, another man and a woman, which were concealed in the cellar of the house. A wizard neighbor, a Marlene McKinnon, alerted the ministry. It was the aurors, specifically a Dorcas Meadowes, who noticed that the woman was missing but confirmed the violence of the murders were, to them, clearly of a magical source. The muggle authorities were informed through the proper channels and another body, that of a 4 year old boy, was found soon after and not far from the home when it was revealed that the two bodies in the cellar were unrelated to the family or to one another. The Sussex man had gone missing several days prior and the woman remains unidentified in the muggle papers. It was after this assessment that Rufus Scrimgeour, Field Head of the South Eastern Aurors Division, made clear in a briefing that if the body of the young boy had been there when the team of aurors arrived first, they would have found it and the Auror Office suspects further foul play and tampering with artifacts. The unidentified woman was confirmed to be what some still, inappropriately, refer to as a "fringe witch". Her wand is from an unknown source and she did not attend Hogwarts. Further confirmation and clarification from the ministry forthcoming.Rufus Scrimgeour did not trust very many people but he lived by the old ways. He knew of Dorcas because of Alastor, he knew Alastor because of Kingsley and so on. He trusted all of those people in that line (and in that order…) because of the person before them but that they had all proven their own merits with time. He trusted that no one in attendance of the "briefing", had said anything or maybe they had? This reporter certainly hadn't been invited. It would be time to make further amendments to the list of people he trusted again and every time fewer people survived to make it to his confidence but many more people moved up in importance. That Dorcas was named was a matter of security as was the other witch named and for that reason, he trusted that neither had gone to find a reporter for the Daily Prophet (if he was in the habit of rolling his eyes, he would have). This was a generality given the state of tension that muggles, historically, remained unnamed but that in an investigation of this scale and sensitivity, everyone involved should have remained anonymous. What disturbed him was how difficult it would be to work with the muggle authorities, every division of the Auror Office was stretched thin and, even worse, some of the aurors he did trust were unavailable due to their own assignments. This, too, was dangerous. An auror could not just "take assignments" on his or her own whim. This wasn't the nineteen-thirties! And why did they have so many separate divisions for such a small country? All of them could be consolidated. People were dying in the field because of the lack of centralized information.Rufus Scrimgeour could feel his stomach growling as he turned the paper over. That's it, all of that information in such a short section and no further explanation. How this reporter got the information and from where, he would never find out. But that little bit of information brought up more questions. What alerted this McKinnon that anything was amiss? How did she contact the ministry so fast, did she have a direct contact? Auror's were effective if they were reached on time but, and he loved them all, they were not generally the first to respond, especially with their steadily dwindling numbers. He ignored his hunger to reread the paper. In fact, it was usually a muggle who tipped them off in cases such as this. How did the aurors find out so quickly? Had someone tampered with artifacts? Who were all of these muggles? Why and how and, and "fringe witch"? They were no longer allowed to say that? This was also, very literally, news to him (he suppressed another eye roll) and stopped reading mid-sentence. He made his way in the direction of something to snack on to see what he could do to untangle the mystery of this missing woman.Rita's article was full of inaccuracies but she did what she could with the time and resources she had available which were constrained mainly by the time and resources the Auror Office had available. She took her job very seriously and she had made a choice to find and get to and report on the truth as it was made available. Her chubby, slightly shiny face made her look even younger than she was but she was determined to report on the horrors of the war and didn't let skeptical looks deter her from getting the potion, hot from the cauldron, so to speak. She could research all of it and write a richer piece but she was getting more assignments at work also and the head of her department insisted she write more and more side angle pieces. People knew there was a war, they didn't always want to read about it. The paper needed more levity, he said as Rita scribbled away at her pad so quickly and with so many amendments that she had to redip her quill several times in a pot of ink floating in the air just in front of her.She tried to explain repeatedly. She could get more information on the murders and the whos and whatsits. She could find more sources. The department head sat at the edge of his desk listening to this earnest, dumpy girl witch insist on how important war time information was. He couldn't tell her that, in times like these, there would be questions asked that wouldn't be answered for several more generations. What other source could she find more reputable than lion-farted Rufus (a difficult source, he didn't understand how she got the interview) or who would care after a month. They were dead, the missing woman was also most likely dead and they were surrounded by ever more people dying everyday. She should be so lucky that she even wrote the piece in the first place. And if she could get the information she did, her skill could be put to better use writing what people actually wanted to read. She seemed so eager to work. So eager to please. He sighed without saying a word and handed her a strip of parchment from his desk and Rita beamed and turned on her heels, triumphant. The department head watched her gold curls with a patch of black and dark blue at the corner bounced out of the way and occasionally revealed a dark splotch on her shoulder where her floating inkwell sometimes bumped into her. All her tops had one. This one looks like a seal, he thought. When she left the office with the door closed behind her, she stopped at the door to read what was written on the parchment: "Foraging Muggle Style. How to tell and acorn from and anchor." The department head could just make out from the frosted glass that her shoulders sank.If she had been given the assignment, she might have found out. She could focus and research and analyze and, Merlin's beard, did she know her way around a parchment with a quill. She wrote the pieces that trotted in small script at the edge of the paper while she wrote about the war still and without being published. She would have the department head look at the work and hand it back with another pointless article assignment over the manuscript. But she kept writing. And it was through luck and that practice that, after having it checked for accuracy, the piece she wrote on the attacks at St. Mungo's made it to the papers in a shortened form. Because she had inadvertently broken the story, they ran the full article the next day. It wasn't until that explosive article written after the first war, that she got to choose her own articles and was given access to the same dataset that her editors were given. She saw for herself when an article did well. She chose to sit during the trials and wrote what she was most passionate about. And she earned money. She would sit with her own assistant and review the Editor Owls and saw her name repeated over and over and the acclaim and praise heaped onto her. She conducted interviews, she eventually discovered the mystery of the Dorset Bodies. She patented a self-filling quill. She earned more money. The department head sometimes handed her manuscripts back but, this time without the assignments. She wrote faster and with greater intensity. With this, and over time, she would learn that the department head was right. No one wanted to read about the war exclusively. And she found that she did not want to write about it exclusively either. She tried writing on Quidditch. More letters of praise. She mentioned, what she believed was a minor detail, the husband of one of the players. The letters asked for more information. She reported on it. They asked for more information. She shopped and noticed that people gave her interviews easier. She shopped some more, wrote more, earned more. She changed a detail, rather played it up, threw in some prose. The department head looked at her over his desk. She left dejected but found the same article in full with a disclaimer that had to be revealed with a spell, the first time the Daily Prophet expanded its "book" since the early first war years. Owls flooded the lobby of the Daily Prophet. So many howlers were sent that the ministry wondered if there shouldn't be a law, some regulation to prevent such an influx. Rita was a snake, a viper and on and on and she preferred the feeling she got with the praise.Then the number of Daily Prophets had to be increased after that. The sales went up and up and up. They had to print several copies in one day to meet demand. People requested an evening edition. The department head, who stayed on in an advisory role after the war years, knocked at the door that had once been his. Rita had trimmed down considerably. Her silk skirt suit was the shade of yellow if it had a voice and had been caught mid scream, trimmed in purple fur from a definitely extinct animal. He shut the door behind him and leaned against it temporarily only to push himself of its frame slightly. Rita looked over her glasses, agitated as she dictated her next piece. He motioned a rectangle in the air. She turned still talking and picked up stacks of parchment to hand to the former department head. She'd cut her hair shorter which exposed the top fabric of her sleek, shiny, (loud) jacket. There was no spot on either of her shoulders. The former department head left the office with the stack of her articles for editing and proofing and animating.He had been a good reporter. He was always honest, fair and articulate but he had been an even better editor. He could spot a serious writer from across the room. As department head, he had nurtured a team of editors and writers, the numbers of which swelled during his tenure even with the wizarding population steadily decreasing by the day. He knew where to place an article and years of watching people and listening had served him well. He had a job for life doing what he loved surrounded by people who loved what they did also. The former department head, now forever advisor, left Rita's used-to-be-his office and smiled to himself at how good he had been at his job.

They had watched the sunset over the woods from the sky. They had sat on brooms over the water and now Basil sat by the fire sipping a spiked, warmed butterbeer by the fire. He surveyed the events and knew he would sleep well and deeply that evening. He knew in the way he had known other things. His mother and uncles had asked where he got the gift from and why his divination's marks hadn't been higher. It had been a running joke and yet… Lydia was telling Philippa about the intricacies of certain obscure magic but everyone was listening casually or lost in their own thoughts. Pieces of their conversation would float over to him. The sun was well set but every time he closed his eyes he could see it setting again and the beauty of it, the warm, orange, brightness of it. He smiled at the memory of it buoyant on his broom. He could feel the warmth of the sun on his face even as he knew it was the fire in front of them.Basil doesn't have the actual memory of his aunt's wedding but had heard the story so many times that he felt that he remembered it but he is in the wrong place. He doesn't know why he started crying and reached out to his aunt at the altar because in this memory of him, about him, he is older and sitting in the back row watching himself and his family. Baby Basil starts crying and he reaches out to his aunt and his mother scoops him up and the audience ahhs. Poor baby he hears someone to his right. The women sitting directly in front of him turns and makes a sincere pouting face to her neighbor. Baby Basil redoubles his efforts and screams even louder and as his mother is getting up to exit, bent double down the aisle, even as everyone can hear him and see them both, he calls out to his aunt. His voice comes out sad but determined. He can't pronounce all of the sounds in the correct order yet but everyone knows who he's talking about. His mother winces and tries to be discreet carrying him out and he wriggles out of her arms and she has to scoop him up like a falling sand. He makes it so that she can't hold him properly and she is this close to the floor trying to get him back into her arms and he senses and opportunity and makes a mad, wobbly scramble for the altar.His mother might as well stand up and run for him, it would be easier, but it's a wedding and everyone feels like they don't want to be the reason for a ruined wedding (especially their own sister's!) even though that can't happen because a baby running for his aunt doesn't know any better and anyway, that's the best part. Basil's mother isn't fast enough and he, in his non-memory can see her face drawn and turning. He watches himself as a baby with a detached amusement peeking over other people's head and shoulders as his mom scoops him up again right before he gets to his aunt. His father thinks this is all very funny even as he makes a half-hearted gesture to stop his own child but he is curious how this will all play out and isn't so concerned about ruining a wedding because he's been married for a few years now and is the father of this very toddler and knows that the wedding is the easy part.Baby Basil screams even harder but they both look up. Baby Basil and Memory him look at his aunt and her arms are outstretched and she's smiling and looks so sad because her heart hurts for her first baby. Her favorite person. Her sister holds her child. It's ok, his aunt's face says. She nods and his mother hands him over to her. His aunt wraps her arms around him and he wraps his arms around her neck and they are holding onto each other. She turns back around to face the officiant but she is rocking back and forth and her cheek is rested on the top of her nephew's head. People are crying in the audience. He doesn't look at his uncle in his memory and doesn't remember that his aunt looked at him deferring and sweetly and asked "may I", knowing he would say, "yes, of course". That he could give her everything but the one thing she wanted. It is only the two of them. Baby Basil in his aunt's arms and even in his own memory of other people's memories the audience is gone and even Adult Basil is gone and it is just him as baby and his aunt holding onto each other. They are trapped or are protecting each other from nothing in a place that doesn't exist, even in other people's memories.Basil chalks this behavior up to the gift that all children and animals have to sense things and to act at the right moment. His aunt cannot have children and his uncle only wanted to make her happy and for her to be happy. Maybe they are or aren't, Basil doesn't think too much about it. She is still the same funny, bright woman. Basil is still her first and favorite baby even though he is no longer a child. There is a picture of this moment somewhere. His uncle looking at them and smiling sadly and maybe even he knows. Maybe that's why they are still together because he knew, if she could pick one, a child or him, it would not have been him but, there was not and there would not be a child so there they were.The butterbeer and the sound of fire is making him sleepy. The memories are making him sleepy. If they could have managed it, another day like this would be ideal but that will not be possible. The day in itself was a miracle. He is glad he brought his own tent and kitting utilitarian though they were. He would most likely wake up in the middle of the night or not sleep at all and think a dreamy, subconscious think. He will think everything and nothing and will or won't remember his ideas and thoughts in the morning. If Lydia and Philippa keep it up, he will not be able to walk around or maybe he can join them in the discussion. Maybe he can learn something. After all, there are several people here who work for the ministry. Maybe he could be an auror. He will ask Dorcas in the morning, he decides because she is no longer there. Fabian is also gone. Good for them, he thinks.Basil ended up falling asleep in the chair. He woke up to Gideon nudging him awake. Philippa was already entering another tent. Basil did not know Lydia had already gone to sleep. He did not know if Dorcas or Fabian were back. He stretched his arms and got up heavy with interrupted sleep. Gideon nodded blearily and made a wave of his hand that said, IwouldnothavemindedsleepinginthechairbutIwaswokenupandthereforealsohadtowakeyouupbecauseIcouldn'tjustleaveyoutherebecausethatwouldmakemelookbadeventhoughwewouldhavebothbeenfinesleepingonthesechairs. Gideon entered the tent Basil had packed and was heard collapsing onto the bed. Basil sensed the deep inhale and soft exhale of someone who falls asleep easily. He heard the body language of someone who loved his sleep. Gideon hadn't realized or cared whose tent he entered, he had just walked into the closest one that Philippa hadn't. Basil entered a tent that wasn't his own, the one Philippa had entered nor the one he knew to be the Prewitt's and found it unpopulated and exceedingly well appointed. There was a small chandelier floating at the top of the low ceilinged tent giving of a soft, sparkly glow and two beds dressed in crisp bed clothes. The walls of the tent were made of heavy tapestry with a deep blue pattern shifting subtly and soothingly on an even darker blue field. Candles stood at regular intervals against the walls in pewter holders. Trunks sat at the end of each bed covered with heavy dark quilts, just in case and a tiled sink and shower stood in the corner. He quietly thanked Gideon for his love of sleep as he tucked himself happily into one of the beds. He would ask to be an auror all right if this is what the salary could get you. When he closed his eyes he saw the sunset again, felt warm all over and fell into a deep, luxurious sleep.Fabian arrived back to camp first. The embers of the fire were still glowing and he recognized the awkwardness of the situation. He did not know who was sleeping where or with whom. He knew two people were in one tent and the others were populated by a person each but the combinations were endless. Lydia and/or Dorcas had brought two tents, he and his brother had brought theirs and Basil most likely brought his own. Fabian had gone back to look at the water and had come back later than he thought. While he was considering what to do he turned at the noise of a branch breaking. Dorcas came out of the woods. She had wandered around to stretch her legs and found herself walking and walking until she got bored. Fabian nodded at her. They were both tired and the day stretched in front of them and behind them in both directions. Fabian, Gideon and Basil camped often enough and with little luxury. Fabian could sleep outside once he got the fire going again. Dorcas could use his tent. He started to walk towards the fire and turned at her insistent quietness. He looked up at her standing at the door of his tent, waiting. Fabian went over, held the tent door open for Dorcas and she walked in and, he let the door, which was only a piece of fabric anyway, drape solidly behind them.

When the second war rolled around, there was no point in fighting to write about it. Everyone was allowed to until they weren't. Because of the article, Rita had been given access to the trials and earned a reputation for her reporting. This time, it was strangely the same. She did not want to write about missing people, missing children. She found that she didn't want to write about blown up bridges, cars set on fires that couldn't be put out with water. So she didn't. Even then, even as she enjoyed writing about the war, as much as one could, she could feel everyone becoming tired of having to be confronted with their reality in writing. She wrote the articles and tucked them away and then she stopped writing them all together. The first war had made her famous. The first war had made her wealthy and it had made her tired. When she did write an article or a paper, she could feel the old rush return. She could feel the old feeling of hunching over a stack of parchment. She remembered that once upon a time, she had had to re-dip her quill several times an article and it made her smile and she was proud of her herself, she was proud for herself for what she had done. She would look up from days of writing and refilling coffee at the longform article and feel the satisfaction of a fresh start and a new ending. She filed those papers away with the pieces of other projects. As far as her writing was concerned, the war ended after the trials. As far as she was concerned, the details and the truth of the wars were no longer worth sharing.If Rita had had it in her, she could have found out more about the missing woman. She could have untangled some of the details. Maybe she would know a fuller story but she was already assigned to another piece and took the opportunity. You must remember how things were then. They were quiet and then they weren't and then it would be quiet for such a long time that people might forget and then…It went something like this: Marlene offered to be the one who said she alerted the ministry because she lived so close to the woman, that it would make it more believable. Rita could not have known that Dorcas had arrived on the scene first with the Prewett brothers and a man named Basil. It was because of this article that didn't exist that Rufus Scrimgeour would never know that he had been correct. The usual order of things, that a muggle did indeed let a witch know is exactly what happened because one had. Phillipa when they arrived back from camp to drop Basil off first was the one to sound the alarm. It was she who pointed out the looping peculiarity of fog and sparkle, the congregation of what appeared to be starlight hovering over the missing woman's family home. Everyone thought that her insistence on turning around to check was from her desire to be on a broom again. Her insistence initially made them all question this fog's meaning and relevance but she had been correct. It did seem magical. It was magic. During the trials of the first war, the name for this magic and its purpose would be explicitly revealed. It had been termed the Dark Mark partly for its irony. It was a shimmering, greenish, lovely even. It did not take its full shape until the intervening years, the time between the wars, when in honor of their fallen leader, the light and fog was organized into the same symbol their progenitors used to bear on their bodies: a snake, slithering through a skull. So when the second war began, when the mark showed up again, people knew and understood and were afraid. But then, after one of the happiest days of some people's lives and the worst for others, a muggle woman was making her way towards the sea pulled by an unknown and unknowable force having left a mystery behind her.Close your eyes. You are closing your eyes so you can accurately imagine what is about to be described and also so that when you understand what you are imagining, you can open your eyes again and realize you are safe and not actually witnessing what you are imaging. Have you closed them yet? Good. The missing woman was dead but you, like Rita and Rufus and the wizarding England that read the Daily Prophet, must have known that. You are sitting on a cloud or rather, maybe you are the cloud. If you look down below, there is the deep turquoise of the sea. If you look out in front of you, you are looking at a cliff face and you can see part of the top of the cliff straggly with itchy, green seagrass that can survive the saline air coming off of the ocean and the cliff face itself angled toward the ground, is not black when dry, but here it never is. The cliff is glistening from the moisture in the air and below that you can see the bright sand. The day will end soon but it is still bright and you notice the sand in a little patch on your right is moving. But it isn't sand at all. It's a person? You hop onto another cloud or merge with the vapor that comes from a crashing wave. It IS a person. You wonder if you should become a grain of sand or the cliff face itself. But stay where you are to understand. So you lean in as best as you can and this person, as they continue walking along the shore, you realize is a woman and you know this, as far as your knowing goes, because the woman is naked. Ah, now you get it! This happens sometimes. But, then again, you think, not here usually. How did she get down here, you wonder. How could any one get down here? There is no discernible foot path for miles and when high tide comes in, the very sand she is walking on will be completely submerged by several feet of water. Something must be wrong. Something is wrong. You lean in closer.She is walking in a strange way. She is upright and looking ahead and yet her limbs are somehow behind her. Something is trailing behind her but she is all there. And that's when she trips over her own feet but she keeps walking. She does not break her fall with her hands her feet keep going forward and she uses her hands to get up after her head plows a little trough in the sand. Yes, something is very wrong. When she stands up she continues as if nothing has happened, you force yourself to sit on an atom in the air in front of her and one of her eyes is filled with sand grains that she makes no attempt to get out of her eyes. She's not even blinking. You realize that you shouldn't have tried to understand. You have missed your opportunity to turn away. You know she is not ok but- You go back to your perch on a cloud or over the ocean.You watch her stop in front a clearing in the rock, a fissure. She stops and turns her head as if looking around but something tells you that she can't actually perceive what she's. Maybe she can see but she doesn't know or understand what's she's. Nevermind. She finds what she must have been looking for and slams her hand onto a sharp edge of jutting from the cliff wall. You wince. If you have to open your eyes, please do. What is she doing? What is wrong? Are you, alright? Good. Close your eyes again.You decide to follow her now, maybe you can help but, no. You feel something drop in your stomach, the fissure is more like an opening (was it before and you just hadn't noticed? But it wasn't like that before, was it?) and you follow her into the opening. You can be yourself now. If you're going to help, you will need all of yourself. You can't do anything as a cloud or seafoam or a teensy atom. Her hand is bloodied but even her blood is the wrong shade, it's behaving incorrectly and you don't want to think it but there should be more of it but it's also very dark in here. You feel a feather, having fallen from the base of your head, fall to rest in between your shoulder blades which makes the hair on your neck stand up. When you reach for it there is nothing there but you felt something all the same. You are momentarily distracted by this feeling, going so far as to check your hand for a feather you know was never there. There is nothing and it's dark, you can barely make out the outline of your own hand. When you look up, you notice the woman walking forward getting shorter in a strange way and now your shoes are wet. She has waded into a shallow and you understand now that there is a shimmer coming from what you understand is water. You back away. Wait! you want to say. Turn around! but the words are stuck in your throat and she can't hear you because you're not there and, if you were, she can't hear you because she is listening to something else somewhere else in her.She walks into the water thats up to her knees and she's not doing that thing where you feel the heaviness of water, she's not trying to keep balance, she's walking straight in and then she drops out of view like she's walked over a sand shelf but she doesn't bob back up. She is gone. You keep backing up because it's very dark. You want to turn around and run but before you do, your back bumps into the wall which makes you jump away from it. You turn and find the way is shut.You came through this way, right? The distance wasn't even that far, was it? You're not even thinking about the woman anymore but you know she is there, you saw her disappear into the water. You saw her and you know she is there and you know she knows you were there and did nothing to stop her but you cannot get out. You think, maybe, you too can slam your hand against something if only you can be back on the beach on the sand. You can't put yourself on a cloud from inside of this place because you don't know if it's still there. The tide will rise soon and you don't know if it will come in and flood this place, if this water is the same as the sea, if the saltiness of the sea will make whatever is in the water float. You have, again, backed yourself into what you know is the inside of a sea cliff. And you feel the salty stickiness of the wall and the discomfort of wanting to sweat when you are in a cold place. You can feel night falling in the cave even as you know it is still day outside. Don't be so silly!, you tell yourself. You just got in here! but you feel the height of the cliffs around you how expansive this place is and as your eyes adjust, the glow in front of you does not reassure you. The light is swallowed up by the great darkness around it. You were right about the water that made your shoes wet. It looks like a black pane of glass where the light hits it.How is the water so still, though? Not even a ripple on its surface. You can't let your own mind fool you into thinking the woman did not fall into it or even that she didn't exist. But you stare at the wet, shining, still water mesmerized. The light is getting ever but only slightly brighter as your eyes keep adjusting and adjusting and you know your mind is playing trick on you because you feel like if you stand there long enough, the entire cave will be filled with the brightest, cleanest, coldest light you have ever seen. The darkness was bad enough but, this is worse. You open your eyes.

Mostly war was boring. They kept odd hours and that was usually the most exciting part of the job. Dorcas, like everyone else would go on her rounds and collect information or just as often as not, probably, even more often, they did not collect anything at all.In her fieldwork as an auror, even as far back in training, she had witnessed more consistently horrifying events. She talked people down from ledges, she nursed her bruises and the scars of others. There had been so much blood. When things became difficult, she called on the reserve from one of her first days out in the field and found whatever it was in herself to get whatever the job was, done. She went in with the intent to save the greatest number of people, to spare as many people pain. She did this often enough that it became second nature and she didn't have to call on anything because she was now that person. She had called on herself so many times that she recognized that she was always there. She was the woman and the auror she wanted to be. And she recognized, too, that people could and did get hurt. She was not there to save because she didn't have those powers so she just did her job as the person she imagined and one day she received an owl from Alastor Moody. She had met him several more times since he had visited the flat she shared with Lydia and other former schoolmates but this would be different. She was different now. He noticed. She smiled easier, she already knew Professor Dumbledore so maybe that helped. By the end of their conversation, when she agreed to be in the Order of the Phoenix, she had thought she understood what they would be doing. She understood why she'd been chosen but what is this saying about expectations? Learn to swim, even gillyweed fails.After she was called to use the very same skills that made her a great auror and just as things were starting to take a turn for the worse or better (depending on who you spoke with) they got very dull, very quickly. She didn't want to have to do her job but as some of us know what use are you without the use of your gifts with no opportunity to use the things that make you who you are. She was an auror and there would always be use for her gifts. But there was a time during the war, when that was not the case. They felt like they sat around a lot, they would get information on the whereabouts of some one person or another and find they were too late. They would get there and find this small group of people already dead and the Order and Dorcas were to play defensive when she was so used to stopping things ahead of time or preventing violence from escalating or standing in between the source and object of the violence. She was asked to be reactive because they didn't have enough information, they didn't have the resources to do otherwise. She stared at these dead people feeling nothing.What could be done at this point? Nothing. What was the point of a revelatory spell? She knew who was responsible for this violence but, she did it anyway, a reflex. How had they even learned to break up the Dark Mark? They had done it so many times. It was all so boring. Maybe this could be said another way. The major difference between her life earlier and the war was that there were so many more dead people. More dead people than she could count in every state of dead one could hope to never imagine. Take my word for it, most of the violence and death was senseless in the truest sense of the word. What did any of these people have to do with any tactical advantage? None. They didn't even serve to hinder the opposing side, they were just dead and it had something to do with the other side being just as bored as the Order or angry. Angry at what Dorcas couldn't fathom. All of them, most of them had grown up in the wealthiest households had every convenience known to the magical and to muggle alike and then this. An entire war over wanting more of what you already had? They were violent and bored already, so when everyone was dead, how much more violent and bored would they be? How much more could they be? And then what?They were at someone's house again, for the umpteenth time, and had found, yes, someone had died. Dorcas set to breaking the mark up above them while Gideon pointed his wand to the ground. They heard a thump and smelled the acrid muskiness of the punctured gas main. The muggle authorities would show up and think there had been a gas leak. That would make them mad. The other side. It should probably be mentioned that at the time, the term "dark arts" had fallen out of favor. It was too… Too… non-descriptive. It was not until much later that it came back in style with the rise of Lord Voldemort but it was argued, certainly in that time, that there could be no such thing. So much wizard magic had to do with the wizard or witch who did the magic. Anyone capable of doing any magic might do so and so one could not do "dark magic" or be a "dark wizard". Many wizards and witches of a certain generation grew up not saying things like that. It was the other side. And while the war raged on, people thought maybe that was too clunky but people were dying too quickly for semantics so they defaulted back to the "dark". But depending on when the witch grew up, as in Dorcas' case, they would always be considered the "other side". And maybe they shouldn't have done that, bait the other side but whether they did or not was not going to stop them from killing more people anyway. They might as well give the families some peace. They might as well give the neighbors some peace. A gas leak was terrifying, yes fine but the alternative would have broken centuries' old rules and what would they say?These people, they want you dead because you have less power than them and they don't know what to do with their own.These people, they have lots of money but no imagination so you are somehow a threat for some inexplicable reason.These people, they are mad and evil. You exist and are therefore in their way. They actually did you a favor. Now you no longer have to die because you are already dead.Gas leak it was.Maybe they were looking for something. Maybe they could find something. The thought crossed her mind the first time, the second, the third, the fourth the. After searching the homes, sometimes for hours, going back in the quiet of the night to find a clue they would usually find nothing. She enlisted the help of specialists. There was always nothing because there was nothing or the thing had been taken but really there was nothing. The bodies were the things to be found, the bodies were the clue. People were going to keep dying because of some reason called war. She would keep watch and yawn through her shifts as everyone else did. She would be called to look for information in places where life had left. She would sleep. She would wake up; she would do the job and then do all of it all over again the next day. People still had to eat, sleep, drink, shit, laugh, cry as necessary or when they could or not at all. Everyone would end up only a few of several ways with one destination.Someday they would all die. Someday they'd all be dead, dead, dead. Whether they would find the remains or not, dead. Did the family know or not? Dead. Fighting for either side? Dead. The work became harder when Philippa left which coincided in an uptick in violence. The direct confrontations started again. There were many more bodies that the members of the Order of the Phoenix had to meet before they died. Lots of things happened all at once all together and she reflected after one such meeting in particular that this was a waste of time. They had pointless jobs, everyone would end up the same way. She knew what Alastor wanted to say to this and he knew that she knew so he didn't say it. He had a feeling then, that she didn't mean it but another idea started to form about her, several ideas. He tried to understand them all and put them in the correct order. Then they received word. The old channels spoke and Lupin heard and soon after , they held something like a meeting to determine what they should do to protect Dorcas since Lord Voldemort was looking for her. If he knew about the Order, he did not care but she was now being hunted and that should have made her afraid. Instead, it was comforting. She really was good at her job, then.Maybe excitement isn't the right word but she felt prepared. All of her training had led up to this. Lord Voldemort wasn't so threatening in the city with everyone so close by. She did not want to die but maybe she wouldn't. Or rather, maybe she could defeat him. She would end the war. That's what it had felt like. This was the final test of her will and her training and she would not fail. But Alastor got yet another idea which he did not have time to understand. It was only right that he be the one the idea visited. He had recommended her to be in the Order and now he insisted that she go into hiding. She must go into hiding. He became paranoid and that unsettled her but there were more disturbing things. He had assumed that she hated the way he did it, the way he said it but that she made peace with it in the cottage as scared as she was as paranoid as she, too, became.Emmeline, long after Dorcas di-. Emmeline had asked Alastor. All of them had wondered but she had needed to know. How did he get Dorcas to leave. What had he said to make her pack her things and go hide? They could understand other people going into hiding, they could even understand the threat of Lord Voldemort but she hadn't been afraid, had she? Dorcas, like all aurors, lived with some mild, low-grade fear constantly, no? What had he said?"What did you say to her?", Emmeline had screamed, taken over by some hysteria. Anyone who saw her then, anyone, would have said that her pupils had turned a different color, she was that enraged.He had sent Dorcas away, not because of Lord Voldemort, though that was reason enough, but because he thought she was losing her mind. She recognized too late what his paranoia must have meant. He thought that she had been moved by what he had said. He would have let her stay if she had been anyone else, if she had just been an auror. She had been once but now all there was was the tubular sound of air trapped in one end of a wave being pushed out of the other. She would fight Lord Voldemort down when the time came. But being out in the water, swimming in the sea and the taste of salt reminded her, as it did that she could do great things as a human. She did not need to be anything more or less than that. She would try to defeat him, she would try to fight him off but he did not lose. His spells did not miss, they were not easily deflected. If she ended the war, that would be ideal. She would retire and never speak to Alastor Moody or anyone in the Order ever again. She would find Philippa. They would have a proper funeral for grandpa. She would come back to this cottage to burn it down and then build something new in its place. She could not imagine that she would ever want to come back to this exact one though the location was beautiful. Lupin had done an excellent job. Hm, maybe, on second thought, she would keep in touch with him. He wasn't so bad.Dorcas trudged out of the ocean even as it tried to pull her back in. She loved that feeling on her heels. It made you feel wanted. She would make herself something to eat when she got back, she thought. She felt pretty good today. She savored the clean feeling of the cold, the ringing in her ears dropped in an out as she sat on the cool sand to stare at the waves. She decided to lay down and make a sand angel. She got up to inspect it, smiling. As she head towards the cottage, the thought of Lord Voldemort drifted back to her. She would fight. That's the type of person she had taught herself to be and then maybe she could let that person go and die, figuratively speaking of course. She could do this everyday without the threat of the war and she could teach herself to be bored which became easier and easier. She could teach herself to be someone else.

Lydia could hear Dorcas barreling up the stairs. She knew everyone in the house by the sound of their footfall but Dorcas was always followed or preceded by what sounded like distant cheering. People chattering and the sound of happy commotion, laughter. If Lydia lay very still, she thought, she could will herself to die and that Dorcas would give her a good funeral. She might not be too happy about Lydia dying in Dorcas' borrowed clothes but she would understand. Instead Lydia stayed very much alive as the door swung open and Dorcas beamed as she was wont to do which Lydia saw as she inclined her head back and shut her eyes."Your day?" Dorcas asked."Long." Lydia said. She hadn't moved but for the motion Dorcas created by jumping on the bed flat on her stomach. "Yours?" Lydia said, eyes still shut.Dorcas took in an exaggerated, deep inhale. Lydia opened one eye when she didn't hear Dorcas let out her breath. Dorcas exhaled through her nose making a pinched, closed-mouth smile and they both laughed."Really? I don't know if I'm cut out for this". Dorcas said exhaling again. Tears welled in her eyes. Lydia read the requirements for auror training and it was brutal. Lydia could sympathize in her way, no one made her use the imperius curse on any of her colleagues. She didn't have to endure the cruciatus curse for any amount of time to get her own certification. She thought about the number of times she apparated that day, how she imagined that the interns were this close to draining the Thames for all the hot water they boiled for tea morning till evening. She felt foolish and embarrassed that, for the most part, all she had had to do was read sheafs of parchment which she might have done anyway for free but, these were really dry and boring and then she had to sort them. The text was really dry, alright? Lydia, didn't know if she actually wanted to know but she felt guilty that her worklife was relatively easy, boring and paid well but she still hated it."What happened, Dorcas?"Dorcas propped herself up on her side. Lydia patted the side of the bed while scooting over. Dorcas grabbed a pillow to herself. She did not want to talk about her day but stared straight ahead of her and, by some force, spoke anyway."We set a man on fire today."Dorcas could feel Lydia tense next to her so she turned and smiled a wan smile. She strangely no longer felt like crying so she continued."We were on a hill and at the top of the hill there was brush and the wizard ran into the brush. He dropped his wand so we thought the difficult part was over.""So you set the brush on fire?""Yes," Dorcas said nodding. "Someone said to get him out that way, force him out, so we set the field on fire."Lydia slumped back into the bed."I'm sorry, Dorcas" She really had had a bad day. To think that someone died that way…"Then he walked out and he was on fire.""Excuse me?" Lydia retorted she sat up. "I thought you said he died"" I said we set a man on fire." Dorcas was speaking to the opposite end of the room still holding the pillow to herself."So he's at St Mungo's then?", even worse, Lydia did not add.Dorcas shook her head. He's being held in the department of mys-Dorcas stopped herself. Even though Lydia worked at the ministry she didn't know how much she knew. Lydia could fill in the blank with multiple places in her mind and learned too that she was not the only one in the house who knew of the ministry's secret places but she thought she might find clarification."Where?", Lydia ventured."Nevermind." Dorcas said. Lydia thought it better not to press the point further. She would find out in time the details concerning ministry matters, which was to say, at some point she would read a report on part of this eventually."He's alive then?"Dorcas shook her head yes."Well that's good then!" Said Lydia who now watched Dorcas as Dorcas stared across the room at nothing in particular.Dorcas muttered a noncommittal sound of agreement."We couldn't kill him." Dorcas continuedNow Lydia was very confused.Here is what happened: the aurors in attendance were called to capture this wizard. Once they arrived, another auror had remarked absently at how beautiful a day it was. Cool and bright. They had not very far to look for the wizard but had chased him a short ways when he dropped his wand. He ran into the field at the top of the hill and the aurors set the hilly field on fire. The man walked out of the fire as a fire (or on fire, how to describe it) and started to descend the hill slowly and methodically. Someone shouted to put the fire out and an auror at the edge of the fire they had started found that he could not and fire felt like it was getting hotter even as it was not that wide or tall, nor did it seem to spread. They tried to extinguish the flame on the man and found they could not. They cast spells to stop him, lift him, trip him and nothing worked.Now Lydia understood but couldn't believe it. She sat up looking at Dorcas, Lydia may not have blinked for a full minute as she understood. There was no way what Dorcas said actually happened and Lydia might have said as much but a question squeezed the thought away."Please tell me no one tried the killing curse…", Lydia's voiced dropped in pitch and volume as she asked."Yes." Lydia tensed again."Mason, someone, shouted not to." she squinted as if trying to peer into the memory she was staring through, trying to remember the details. "Anyway I wouldn't have cast it.""Well, then, how?" Lydia asked.The man continued walking and Dorcas could hear people talking in the background, arguing. The man would get away eventually. Could he apparate like that? According to what Lydia knew, he could have but that maybe did not matter since he had been stopped beforehand. Dorcas had dug a patch in the ground. She knelt and placed her left hand in the dirt and with her wand in her right hand draw a circle around all of them: the wizard, the aurors and herself. She then pointed her wand at the man and started to chant. To cast a spell and several things happened. First the grass in the circle became greener, darker. Then it started to move towards the wizard on fire. But not just the grass itself but part of the earth underneath it moved also so that the aurors had to run to not be pulled into the wizard's orbit. She built a tunnel around the man with the earth from the circle. It slid over itself and as it moved Dorcas had to move awkwardly on her knees and moved her hand to maintain contact with the ground because she and the patch she had made was moving toward the man also. One of the other aurors understood and cleaved a trench around her so that she could stay still and have her hand on the ground. The land formed-"A chimney." Lydia said in her lowered voice. Now out of awe instead of fear.Dorcas shook her head again and sighed.The top of the mound was sealed off. The grass on the outside of the mound started to turn color and dry up before falling to the ground burnt. A hole was made at the top of the mound smoked and then the smoke turned black and billowed out and still Dorcas stayed chanting. The first incantations to move the earth, the second to make a container and the third, which took all her concentration, to keep the wizard inside it from cooking.The aurors had several options. They could open the mound and find that the wizard had other tricks, he could burst into flame again, he could disapperate. It was better that he be dead and turn him over to an expert than to risk him being alive and still dangerous. Another trench was made around the mound to loosen it from the surrounding dirt using levitation. Dorcas instinctively grabbed a handful of dirt, it might not make a difference but-"It did. It did." Lydia insisted.The wizard was transported by broom with Dorcas concentrating on maintaining her incantations that she barely noticed precariousness of the ride even as she balanced with her wand arm wrapped around the auror doing the flying, the other hand clutching a handful of dirt and her eyes never leaving what looked like a giant cracked over clay ball streaming acrid black smoke all the while. Whoever stayed in the field was able to put the fire out and the wizard survived the trip to the ministry and was relatively unharmed.Lydia stared , he mouth agape. She closed her mouth, breathed out through her nose and shook her head; she closed her eyes and then asked,"How did you know to do that?""Do what?""That!""I didn't. We just make it up most of the time. We do what we can without hurting anyone.""But how did you know he was immolata"Dorcas hadn't known. She didn't even know that word.Lydia knew she was smart, you could not have told her she wasn't and, if you had, she would not have believed it because it was untrue. Dorcas had said as much how much of a genius she was and that everyday Lydia taught her something new, which was true. After supper, Lydia would go over "the report", things she had read or learned while working that she would share with Dorcas and Dorcas would often as not, even though she was qualified to be an auror, have not heard or studied a full nine-tenths of whatever Lydia mentioned. But it was through one of these after meal reports that started the argument that gave Dorcas the idea.All of the flatmates had an argument about the Trace. They were all convinced that it was real to which Lydia rebutted that magic would not only be difficult but impractical. You have muggles born to wizards, wizards born to wizards and then wizards born to muggles. How would the ministry be able to keep track of all of these people? It would require touch magic at the least. Lydia maintained that the trace was a rumor and a way for wizard-born wizards to not advance so far ahead of their peers. Lydia had no interest in the stories of a person who was cousins with a butterbeer salesperson who knew a dragon tamer who was in Azkaban because they did magic that one time before they were of age. Might they be in Azkaban because of the dragons? Lydia retorted.There were so few immolata that Lydia had only read about them once. If the wizard had died, he would have created fiend fyre. If he had apparated he risked killing himself and leaving behind fiend fyre."What would you have done?", Dorcas asked.She meant it as a genuine question which Lydia understood."I don't know. I might have just followed him around until he got too hungry or tired to continue. We don't know what happens if they fall asleep or if they even need to." Now Lydia had pulled herself up to rest on the headboard and she too was staring at nothing in particular in front of her. "Their bodies aren't just on fire, it's everything so to speak. You mentioned he was walking slowly which leads me to believe it takes a great act of will, that it's difficult, it's taxing."As Lydia explained, Dorcas realized how she could not articulate as quickly as Lydia could what she understood about taking the dirt with her, about having her hand in the soil. The auror, whoever it had been, who had said to hold the killing curse must have understood something about the nature of the fire but couldn't articulate, or didn't have time to, why something was or wasn't a bad idea. They were trained to assess and act and did. They were trained to trust each other and had. As aurors, the latter, at least, rarely failed them and if it did, their understanding of the former lead them to forgive each other quickly. Lydia was not an auror but helped her articulate and understand. They both sighed for different reasons staring before them before Lydia started to speak out loud, mostly to herself, to brainstorm and build out what might be included in "the report" which would have been ready by evening's end if it hadn't been for a visitor.

All of them but Stan were now standing in front of the door to the living room. Heidi could not have smiled any harder. She had just left some of the fresh baked pastries in front of the great Alastor Moody with the most flavorsome tea she could mix on the fly. She had sprinted to her room and mixed a little orange zest with a little lavender and a black tea from India that she had picked up in Tangenti Alley that smelled crisp. It would go perfectly with the biscuits! Maybe she could make something else but for now she was standing outside the door unable to contain herself. Dorcas was still unsure of the outfit she was wearing."Anything will do. You look lovely now but you can't keep him waiting all day." Bradley hissed."Brad's right." Lydia said eying Dorcas outfit."What's wrong?" Dorcas replied."Nothing." Lydia said. "Nothing at all."Lydia…""It's nothing. Really." She said unconvincingly. Heidi could not contain herself."He said he really enjoyed the biscuits! And the tea! He wished me good luck on the bakery, said if he'd have known, he would have brought something to take seconds!""So just pack him something to go then, 'Dis.""He's leaving? Has he left?!" Stan eyes stared wide from his place on the steps. He had a handful of parchment of photos or papers nearly crushed in his hands."Quiet." Bradley pointed towards the door.Stan deflated, looked like he was going to cry. His free hand left the bannister and flew to his panting chest. This was all too much for him. Lydia surveyed the scene. All this feeling from someone who studied the stars. And this is precisely why she hadn't studied divinations. She shook her head."Ooh, the blue top!" Brad said. "The one with daisies. You look lovely in that one.""I couldn't find it…" said Dorcas, smoothing over her top. Lydia's mouth drew into a straight line exposing her teeth."I lent it to Heidi." she said.Heidi wished she still had something in her hands and scratched the back of her hairline."It's good luck. I wore it when I got my apprenticeship and thought it could be good luck to someone else so I lent it to someone we went to school with. You know Emily? She was a Ravenclaw I think…" Her voice dropped away.Lydia had seized on the truth of what Heidi had said. "It really is good luck."Dorcas looked back and forth at them both."Might have been nice to have some of that luck now.""I'll say." Brad added.Dorcas looked at him sidelong.Brad shrugged his shoulders."We make our own luck, don't we?" Said Stan fully recovered and gleeful again. "Some of it's the stars and the rest is us."He shoved the papers in Dorcas direction dumping them in her arms. Dorcas looked down and saw the man she was supposed to meet on the other side of the door looking at her from a photograph. She couldn't do this."I can't do this." Dorcas said."Of course you can." They all said in their own way at the same time, some slightly kinder than the others."What if he's telling me I can't be an auror? Or something about, about something?"Lydia was losing patience. "During a war? They send out one of history's greatest aurors to tell an almost auror that she can't be one?" She could tell Dorcas really was nervous. Her shoulders dropped and she rolled her eyes understanding what she had gone through that day and trying to understand what she'd been through to get that far and feeling slightly guilty for it. "Look Dorcas, whatever he says will be fine. You are an extraordinary witch and I wouldn't say that to just anyone."Heidi conceded, nodding in affirmation. Lydia placed both hands on Dorcas' shoulders."Go in there with your chin up and shoulders down and whatever he says we will deal with together…"Tears stood in Stan's eyes."…Or alone depends on what he says.""Good on you, Lydia!""What? Did I say something wrong?" Said Lydia looking back and forth between Brad and Dorcas sensing the sarcasm in Brad's voice.Dorcas smiled and shook her head. She knew Lydia. They all knew her even though Lydia might have sworn that they didn't."Nothing at all but, maybe we can speed this up since he's been waiting for at least fifteen minutes now! So go!" Said Brad.Dorcas took a deep breath and, clutching the papers to her chest, made her way for the door."Wait!" Hissed Lydia. She ran to the kitchen, and grabbed her wand.She returned and waved it, the papers flew into the air. She waved her wand again and Dorcas' shirt tucked itself in and she waved her wand a third time and the papers landed neatly and straightened out in her hands."Better will have to do." She muttered. Dorcas gave her a look of thanks."Wait!" Lydia said as Dorcas turned the door knob. She slid up to Dorcas and sighed. Under her breath and quickly but still sincerely she said."Look, you know how I feel about people but I really do enjoy living here and anyway, I don't think I can afford to live somewhere else on my salary right now. Try not to get sacked."And she pushed the door open so Dorcas had no choice but to enter the room.The door closed neatly behind her.

Alastor could hear chattering on the other side of the door now and the faint ticking of a clock. He looked around the room and thought it was dressed rather formally given the age of the people who lived there. He correctly guessed that they were renting someone else's house. He had always had access to money, first through his own parents, who were aurors, and then when he went to training himself so he hadn't had to live with anyone else when he was younger. He knew how people could behave when he was around and so, after a point, almost right after school, it might have been awkward to live with anyone anyway. The second anyone had brought home a guest, what was going on on the opposite side of that door would happen over and over again and so it was less trouble to live by himself.His arms were rested on his thighs and his fingers were laced. He continued to survey the room. Everything seemed like they came from an older person or people, or at least the same people, the deep marroon-y, forest green-y, dark grey jacquard of the couch, the embroideries, the heaviness of the squat side tables. It all gave the impression that it was musty and dust-covered and yet it was spotless. The setting sun cast a soft glow in the room and further illuminated the things in the room that Alastor also correctly assumed did not belong to the original owners. A bright, yellow wood upright piano stood proudly in the corner, it was carved in some ornate something that might have found a home here but the carving was more delicate and lighter, more playful. A vase of flowers sat on one of the side tables on a coaster of gleaming cracked stone and on the heavy old coffee table, sat a fuchsia tray with little figures dancing on it in some new style of the day. All of these things made him smile to himself.He heard someone come down the stairs and stop midway. He wondered in passing what the people on the other side of the door might be saying but he had a very strong idea of what was going on. He thought to take another sip of tea. It was very tasty. Hm, he thought to himself. The young woman who opened the door. The piano or flowers or the cracked stone belongs to her. The tray certainly and definitely belongs to the young woman who brought them in. He really did think that if she got to starting a bakery, if she baked as well as these pastries, she would be wealthier than him in no time whatsoever but he was not there for either of them.Alastor had heard Dorcas' name now several times and knew she worked closely with Mason, she was no longer an apprentice as far as he was concerned. Was it two field appointments ago when she had pulled a man out of part of a cabinet? Mason and Dorcas' had both caught the witch who had apparated with the wizard and left a lot of him fused with the furniture not even having the decency to splinch him in the air. Instead of sending the wizard directly to Mungo's, she knew enough of the magic to prize his legs and shoulder blade from the surrounding wood. She had cast a charm or spell or something that sent part of his blood circulating through the wood itself, along the channels already there and back into his body until a specialist could separate the wizard's heart and spine from the plane he was stuck in. Both Alastor and Kingsley considered sending an owl of congratulations and praise for that. When he learned the news of what happened today however, he told Kingsley and his team that he would show up himself. This used to be more common. Alastor had many owls and letters sent to him in his day. Aurors used to visit each other for encouragement and support, even for small cases. The small cases could very quickly get out of hand. They had all lost someone to something that started as a small case.Alastor heard the door and looked up. There was a pause and then the person he wanted to see was in the room. He stood up."Miss Meadowes?"She gave something of a curtsy. She hadn't meant to."Yes. Hello, Mr. Moody." She stammered still carrying the stack of papers as she made her way forward. She noticed right on time and turned to set them on top of the piano by the door. She wiped her hands against her trousers."Nice to finally meet you." Said Alastor.She shook his hand when she was closer, nodding, unsure of what to say. He sat back down on the couch smiling. She continued to stand. He motioned for the chair and she sat in a chair in a house that she paid rent in because she was calculating on the best time to sit and then she hadn't sat at the right time and then she didn't know if she should keep standing and-"You don't mind. Just as a precaution." Dorcas shook her head."Actually, do you mind, if it is no problem for you Mr. Moody?"He shook his head. Dorcas pulled her wand from under her pants leg tucked in her sock. Alastor breathed a quiet sigh of relief, he thought momentarily that she was one of the aurors who only kept her wand for work but it had been there all along.She turned in the chair."Pulsonorate silencio!"And a bang sounded against the door and Stan yelped in surprise from the other side.Alastor covered his mouth with one hand. He might have found this even funnier if she had not turned back to sit in the chair as nervous as she had come through the door."Thank you." She muttered.He nodded his head, removing his hand from his face but still smiling."I'm here, Ms. Meadowes to discuss your work." Dorcas tensed. "Everything is fine. Better than that, in fact, I'm here because I heard about your case earlier today and wanted to commend you on a job very well done. We have discussed some of your cases and all of us our proud and impressed by your work." Dorcas looked surprised. "Yes, Ms. Meadowes. If this is the kind of work you're doing now, then England is very lucky to have you as an auror. Thank you for all of your service and good work."Dorcas really did not know what to say."You look surprised.""I didn't know if… I wasn't sure why you'd be here if… thank you. Thank you, sir.""You're welcome. Please let me know if there's anything any of us can do for you. I've discussed this all with Mason, of course, and you are free to continue working with him, in fact I'd personally encourage that, but we have decided as district heads that you are no longer an apprentice as of today."Dorcas eyes widened."When you feel ready, and only then, you are free to take assignments alone and as you feel comfortable and safe. Know also, and I am unsure if this is still taught during training, you working alone is never a requirement, we never fight alone. You can send a message to any of us to support you. This really only means that if you see fit, you can now work by yourself and can host your own apprentice. Mason will discuss your salary tomorrow morning. Whichever number you have in mind, double it and add a zero. Really, this just means a lot more paperwork." He smiled, he thought the last part was funny. "Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything I can help you with."Dorcas shook her head taking it all in. She was no longer an apprentice? She was planning on quitting tomorrow, should she tell him that? No, nope. Don't say that! They thought she was doing well? Alastor Moody thought she was doing well? This was amazing news. Maybe she wasn't so awful at her job after all! Or maybe she was, she thought, but this was still good news! She would have to go over what to do with Lydia later today. She might have to discuss this with Brad, hell, they should all discuss what she would do. She would make some tea and see if Heidi had some of the bicuits leftover or could make something else."Thank you so much for everything that you've said today, sir. I am only glad that you and the auror league find my contribu-."Something had caught her eye and her face dropped. Alastor followed her sightline. The handful of the honey almond treats they had multiplied on the tray. Now Alastor was laughing behind his hand but Dorcas didn't even notice."As I was saying," Dorcas powered through, "before these desserts started to-" She had been trying to be funny even if she didn't feel like it was, she was trying to break some of the tension she felt in herself but the biscuits bloomed again on the tray. Heidi put a charm on them, didn't she? Biscuit, pastry, baking, Dorcas thought and the pile grew three times larger and spilled onto the floor. Dorcas inhaled slowly, her voice dropped and she turned."Mr. Moody, I am so sorry. It's just that my friends are so excited for you to be here. I hope you understand and I had nothing to do with this." He looked up to see her holding back tears. She pointed her wand at the tray and mumbled something. Dessert, she thought and the tray stayed as large as it was but didn't grow."Miss Meadowes, I-""Dorcas." She whispered. She was too embarrassed to accept this level of formality when he had just complimented her on her work and her little kid flatmates were doing little kid magic in front of their, her and her boss' boss' boss' hero."Dorcas, I don't mind. They were delicious and," he cleared his throat to keep from laughing, "now I can take some home without feeling guilty."Dorcas relaxed."Thank you Mr. Moody.""Alastor. If you don't have any questions," Dorcas shook her head vigorously, "May I ask what that stack of things you brought in might be." Dorcas closed her eyes, took a deep breath and then exhaled.-The door opened up to her flatmates crowded around it. They milled as if they hadn't been trying to catch a little of what was being discussed but didn't dare try to cast a counterspell or amplify what was said on the other side. They were reasonably sure that Alastor Moody might just give them a stern talking to about privacy and the sensitive nature of his work but, for all that they knew that Dorcas loved them, in this particular instance, they were certain she would have no hesitation in testifying against them all and recommending they be sent directly to Azkaban. She looked at them all."Heidi," Oh no, oh no, oh no, she thought. "He wants to know if you have a container to spare so he can take some of the biscuits home."Heidi beamed and seemingly out of nowhere, she brought her hands from behind her back and there it was, a container full of pastries."Tell him, I put some tea in there too. It's a great pairing, I think. If he doesn't like it he can feel free to just gift it to someon-"Dorcas made to open the door to go back into the living room and turned again "When this door is opened again, can you not all be crowded around it? Please and thank you!" She hissed and went back inside.Alastor Moody was now standing and received the gift."Thank you. I only wish, I could also take the tea. It was a delightful pairing."

"Please after you." Dorcas grabbed the stack of papers from the piano and swung the door open to let Alastor go first and there were her flatmates, even closer to the door than they were before, scrambling to get up. Dorcas stood behind him, her head hung in defeat."Hello. All of you." He said nodding to the four of them in turn."Hello, sir!""Mr. Moody, a true honor.""Thank you for visiting our home.""Mr. Moody!"He turned to Dorcas, again. "Please, remember what I said about Mason.""Thank you, sir." He smiled a half-smile. He knew that if she called him Alastor, all of the people looking at him now with sparkling, gleaming eyes would collapse right there.He turned to Heidi."These were very nice. Good luck with your bakery and thank you for the gifts.""And you too, Mr. Moody. When the bakery is up and flying, you can order anything you'd like from the menu anytime for the rest of your life free of charge. I mean until the day you die. It could be ten years from now, twenty."Heidi." Brad said."A hundred years.""Heidi." Brad repeated."Well, you know what I mean." The expression on her face was unsure if she believed that."I understand. Thank you. And you, Lydia is it, I heard you work at the ministry."Lydia's eyes widened. She looked over his shoulder to Dorcas. Dorcas face remained unmoving and impassive."I do work at the ministry." she said looking back at Alastor. He held out his hand and shook hers. "I'm sure you do very important work."Lydia said nothing. Alastor smiled."Well, I'm still just an apprentice but someday soon I hope to not be."Dorcas had never seen Lydia this nervous about anything. She'd even started to smile in her giddiness."If you ever need any information I might have at the ministry, not saying that you don't have that same information or not that you don't know anyone else who can get you that information," she laughed nervously, "but, maybe, if you are in need of," and here her voice started to drop off "a specific type of parchment or a form request, I can help you. I can help you find the right one."Lydia was as thorough as ever and as she was talking she had not realized she was shaking his hand still. She heard herself not offer the gift of a lifetime of free pastries but instead the opportunity to have someone tell him about forms. The smile started to fade from her face."Thank you, Lydia.""Mh-hm." She said as she forced herself to smile again. She let go of his hand, turned on her heels and walked away.Alastor for the upteenth time that day, dropped his head to conceal a smile."Hi, I'm Stan. Did you get the," he looked at Dorcas still in the doorway whose face had not changed throughout the entirety of this exchange and holding the stack of press clippings."I apologize, Stan, I'm not really one for autographs." Dorcas rolled her eyes as Stan wilted. "But, if you keep it to yourselves, please." Alastor pulled a sheet of parchment out from his dark green coat pocket and handed it to Stan who looked at the autograph and clutched it to his chest."Thank you so much." He said breathless. "Me and Brad," he pulled Brad up to himself, "we work for the Astronomer's Association of England and North Wales. We plot charts and the like. We don't have much to offer," Brad glanced at Stan, "but we are big fans of your work. Thank you for keeping all of us safe.""Thank you both for your work." Brad nodded and tilted forward in a small, conspicuous half bow. Stan bowed outright. They shook hands."As a matter of security, if you could please keep my visit between yourselves." Stan nodded."Of course, I got this from a shop in Diagon Alley." He said."Good. And," he motioned, towards the kitchen, "could you also tel-""She won't say anything." They all said in perfect unison."Good. It was nice meeting all of you." He turned slightly to Dorcas as they all walked to the front door in an awkward, slightly immobile tangle. "I hope to work with you in the field one day soon, Miss Meadowes."She smiled at him."Thank you again, sir."Stan rushed for the door."That won't be necessary." Alastor waved. When the door shut behind him, he couldn't tell you exactly why but when he heard the squealing and cheering, he imagined that they had wrapped themselves around Dorcas and that she stood there, mock pretending that it bothered her but that she was smiling and enjoying the attention. He could not have told you why, even though he knew he had something to do with it, that he mostly didn't, and that they celebrated each other and her and her them and that this might have been any other day of the week and he could have been anyone else and that this, of all of the things that he had witnessed today made him happiest of all and certain that Dorcas was as good an auror as everyone said she was and as great as they said she would someday be.

Philippa woke early. Even as she had stayed awake longer than her usual bedtime for an excellent reason. After getting dressed quietly, she kissed her still sleeping husband good morning. She had left him sleeping downstairs but he had found his way up the stairs to their warm bed. She left the party when she had not because she wasn't enjoying herself but because she was just older now. She left the party to the babies satisfied with the amount of get down that she had offered and when no one noticed, even as the party started to wind down, she made her way upstairs content to clean up later. She had raised good kids and heard soft humming from someone in the kitchen, she heard the soft clanking of dishes and running water. Her kids had also raised good children, even as she walked down the stairs she noticed the house was that much tidier than when she had retired to bed after leaving her husband snoring on the recliner. She would help later, she just needed to sneak out shortly and then she turned behind her quickly on instinct. Her granddaughter was following behind her in a way that kids do when they think they're being sneaky exaggerated tiptoeing and all. She looked like a little cartoon character she whispered louder than Philippa thought she meant to. There was nothing for it, the little girl, her sweet grand baby sensed that her grandmother was going out and every event with her grandmother was fun, every event an adventure. They were outside after morning salutations and a kiss on the cheek to the girlfriend of one of her grandsons, the one doing the dishes. A girlfriend. Philippa sighed to herself and thought she really was an old woman now. If she were lucky she might get to meet a great grandchild. Her granddaughter looked up at her a little impatient, asked if they were ready to go now. I am lucky, Philippa thought.Philippa and her granddaughter walked small, young little kid hand in bigger, older grandma hand. Shortly, Philippa and the baby, whose nickname was alternately Lentil or Bug because she was so small, came to a flower stall. Her granddaughter chose and insisted on carrying a single flower and her grandmother chose a bunch of several. She admired how decisive this child was that she had insisted on the one. Philippa asked if she wanted only the one and that type of flower and offered to get a few more but the child remained resolute."No, this one.", she had said looking over the others in confirmation of the one she held. She absentmindedly brought it to her chest.They boarded the bus and they talked in their old, young person young, old person way. The journey was shorter than it had ever been but Philippa still thought the baby might get tired but instead she had kept her from being tired. She would fall asleep on the way back after staring out of the window in a meditative baby silence observing and recording and remembering and feeling but on the way, she chatted with her grandmother laughing openly and freely and making several of the other bus riders smile to themselves. When they arrived at the beach Philippa and Lentil took their shoes off at the edge of the street and the sand. Philippa found a nice spot to sit on the edge of concrete bench one of the many and they both watched the sea until the baby got distracted which happened almost immediately. Look at this shell! What's that? Grandma, let's go in the water! It was too cold for that, the sky filled with a noncommittal haze of grey clouds the fog having lifted only a few, sad hours ago. She ran to the edge of the ocean and back and back again screeching and screaming and laughing. Philippa got up to run and play too. Why not? They ran back and forth to the water's edge and both got their shoes wet. They went back to the bus panting and laughing as the morning sun started to burn off the last bits of haze stuck to the shore. Somehow the child remembered the flower long enough to grab it for the return trip home and then forgot it on the bus. Philippa had forgotten her bunch and they never made it passed their perch on the bench facing the water.They both got home empty handed and happy to a house full of even happier people, more of them awake now. When asked what they had done and where they had gone, the child realized in her child way how special, if insignificant, the trip had been and kept the information very much to herself smiled to her grandmother, held up a finger to her round, little face, a shush which her grandmother returned smiling. Philippa's daughter and Lentil's mother shrugged still tired but thankful.It was too early for this. A cousin had peeked around downstairs, realized it wasn't worth his time, snuggled right back down to sleep smiling. Grandpa had done something similar but went to his chair in the living room and being a grandpa he found a luxury in falling asleep in a chair surrounded by his loved ones but thirty, forty years earlier, he would have gone right back upstairs to sleep in a bed too and I mean right back upstairs. This one was rubbing his face, a yawn, the other adults and even the older children woke up and the morning sounds started. Even the building was happy and waking up with a yawn fluttered its upstairs shutters to enjoy the remainder of the week's birthday events. The girlfriend sat at the piano now that the house was almost completely tidied after the nudging of someone who wanted music in the house. They would take over whatever she had been doing. The house perked up even further. The house loved music and laughter and joy! Philippa turned at the piano being played and then remembered the flowers. And she felt so happy she could cry but didn't. Her granddaughter went to sit at the elbow of the pretty, nice girl who had come in with her cousin. The granddaughter picked out parts of a tune she had never heard. Philippa sat on the couch with her family buzzing around her. She didn't want to remember what she remembered but maybe you can't always control that. So she listened and remembered and tried to forget and couldn't but also did. Some parts of the music had changed or did she remember incorrectly? She did not. She would never forget that music. Her mind might but her hands wouldn't and she played along in her mind and realized that someone must have changed other parts. She did not know what to feel so she sat and listened. The house had never heard that music before and trilled. It kept the secret joys and fears and pains and regrets and funerals and births and birthdays and Sundays and Thursdays and everydays of all who had ever lived there once and those who lived there still and remembered the best, happiest parts listening to the piano music. The house hummed which was the humming of the people in the house, really, but it was the same thing. It kept and held the memories of those who would remember or forget, even by choice, because it kept and held them. Sometimes the house held people who were even very happy and sometimes. The piano continued into a sweeping something that soared over a cold lake at dusk and the cousin who had tucked himself into bed couldn't get back to sleep because he was awake listening too. The house held the young and the old and they held their secrets: the flowers, the bus ride, the beach and their wet shoes airing outside, their feet dry and warm now.

This takes place someplace in the 5th year around the middle of the first term, months before the 'lake incident'. The Marauders have finished their Animagi transformations, so they've gone on a couple of full moons with Remus. The Marauder's Map is nearly finished, so that's why it's being used here.I think that the relationship with James and Lily wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. I mean, obviously she hated him whenever he was bullying Snape, but I don't think it would prevent her from having small talk with him. They were in the same year and house, after all. Their relationship turned sour after the lake incident, but in this story, James apologizes immediately after returning to Hogwarts as 6th years.Chapter One: Of Wolf and SnapeSeverus Snape was sat completely still in a broom closet just outside of Gryffindor Tower. He kept himself a distance away from the Marauders, minus Lupin, who was sick as usual. They had their backs to him and were talking in quiet, even tones. He hid in the shadows, as he always had and it was so dark that not even Severus could see his own hands. The only source of light came from a dying torch that sputtered fumes of dim fire, and from the light of the full moon streaming through the open window.He laughed inwardly at the three of them. Severus had never used the term Marauder. It was stupid and childish, but then again, thought Severus begrudgingly, there were no other words to describe that lot.He heard snippets of their conversation. He caught something about Moony and the Whomping Willow. Potter held a piece of parchment in his hands, but Severus couldn't see what was on it.Suddenly they all turned in his direction, and keeping care not to look at the broom closet, Severus noted, they stepped in through the portrait hole slowly. Finally, Snape reached out his hand to the door handle and was about to leave when suddenly a mocking voice jeered at him."Come out, Snivellus, I know you're there."Severus closed his eyes. Sirius Black. He had no idea what to do now.Severus pushed the door of the broom closet open and brandished his wand at Black, who had his wand pointed at him too.Black raised an eyebrow, smiling scathingly. "Really Snivellus, I didn't think you'd sink this low. Sneaking and slithering around like the little snake you are, what the bloody hell were you thinking?"Severus hissed, a low, chilling sound. "Sod off, Black. What I do is none of your business.""None of my business?" said Black disbelievingly. "What, you expect me to believe that you're going to ask me or James or Peter on a date?"Severus said nothing."Or maybe," said Black coldly, but then smiled sinisterly. "You want to ask darling Lily Evans?"Severus inhaled sharply, and his insides filled with rage. He raised his wand, about to curse Black to oblivion, but then his wand flew out of his hand towards Sirius Black's outstretched arm."You'll have to be quicker than that, Snivellus," said Black, contempt dripping from every word."Give me my wand back, you filthy blood traitor!"Sirius inclined his head. "Certainly."He tossed the wand in the air like he was playing tennis, and then trained his own wand at it as it fell."Depulso!"Severus's wand shot towards him before he could react and slammed into his forehead, causing sparks to fly out of the tip. He slumped to the ground."Be careful what you wish for, Snivellus," said Black, and he stepped towards him, his wand raised.Severus couldn't pretend that he wasn't scared; he was dazed and hurt, and Severus was unable to reach for his wand. He closed his eyes, bracing himself for a curse...It didn't come.Severus looked up cautiously. Black was studying him, his eyes tracing over Severus's face."You're so eager to get answers," said Black slowly, any trace of loathing in his voice gone, replaced by mock understanding. "You want to know why Remus gets sick all the time."Severus remained silent. Black stepped forwards again and leaned down, his face inches away from Severus's."There's an opening between one of the roots of the Whomping Willow," whispered Black. "Touch the knot above it, and it'll lead you to the answer to your question."Then Black backed away, next to the Fat Lady. He whispered the password to it and he put one leg through."Go there at your own risk, Snape," said Black, his expression unreadable. "Don't say I didn't warn you."And he stepped through. The painting swung shut behind him.Snape was breathing heavily. He snatched his wand up and scrambled towards the open window. He could see the Whomping Willow in the moonlight, thrashing and whirling about. Then suddenly, the tree froze.As he watched, he saw Madam Pomfrey emerge from beneath the tree. She dusted herself off and made her way back to the castle.Severus's interest was piqued. He stood up, and looking left and right, disappeared down the corridor.James was sitting in the common room talking to Marlene and Lily. He saw Sirius come through the portrait hole – he assumed that he'd taken care of the Snape problem, and was about to call him over when suddenly Sirius ducked his head and avoided his gaze. He practically ran towards the boy's dormitories.James raised an eyebrow at him through the ceiling. He turned to Lily and Marlene, who were also taken aback at Sirius's weird behaviour. He gave his best mate five minutes to get comfortable. If he'd lost his fight against Snape... Well, there was always the full moon to cheer him up."Excuse me, ladies," he said swiftly. "Let's go, Wormtail."He and Peter ascended the stairs and knocked on their door. There was no sound coming from inside. James opened it forcefully and found Sirius sitting on his bed, a bottle of firewhisky in hand. James noticed that there was another bottle on top of his bedside cabinet."Padfoot?"Sirius gave a start and stared at James and Peter as though he'd just realized they were there. He gave a grunt in greeting and turned back to his bottle, downing it in one go."How did it go with Snape?" asked Peter tentatively."It went fine." His answer was short and swift.James frowned. It was unlike Sirius not to gloat about his duels. He looked all right to James physically. At least, there weren't any visible injuries, so James figured that he'd gotten out fine."Sirius, is something wrong?" asked James.Sirius shook his head and summoned another drink."All right, then," said James uncertainly. "And stop drinking, Padfoot. We don't want a repeat of the first full moon. A drunk dog is a bad dog."James and Peter chuckled at the memory, but Sirius didn't join in. In fact, when James mentioned the full moon, he'd gone white as a sheet.James ignored it, chalking it up to the drink. "Well, I reckon we should get an early start. I'll get my cloak out. Here, Wormy, hold the map.""We can't go," mumbled Sirius. He took another gulp of firewhisky.James and Peter looked at him."What?" said Peter."We can't go," repeated Sirius.James stooped down until he was face to face with him. "Why can't we go?""Because, Prongsie," slurred Sirius drunkenly, "Snivellus's ugly face'll be there."There was a pause before anything happened. James looked at him sharply. "What did you say? What do you mean Snape'll be there?"Sirius looked at James, his eyes unfocused. "Moony'll have Snape to keep him company tonight, Prongs, I told him how to get past the Whomping Willow." Sirius grinned, sloshing firewhisky all over himself. "Serves him right, that stupid – fucking – snake. Always sneaking around for answers, t-trying to get us expelled..."James and Peter were too horrified to say anything."We won't have to w-worry about him anymore, Prongs!" exclaimed Sirius delightedly, his eyes crossing. "That bastard's as good as dead!"Sirius looked so damned pleased with himself, and he finished the bottle before any of them could open their mouths. James recovered first. He looked at Sirius as though he didn't know him at all."You have no idea what you've done," murmured James, slowly backing away from him, "No idea. To Snape, to Remus, to yourself..."Sirius ducked down, about to grab another bottle of firewhisky, but James had had enough. He pointed his wand at Sirius, and instantly the drapes on his bed sprang to life and wrapped themselves around his body. Sirius yelled and shouted profanities at him, but James was staring at him, cold fury in his eyes."You fucking prat, you're going to get all of us expelled, you're going to get Snape killed!" James rounded on Wormtail. "Call Dumbledore – anybody with authority, and get someone in here to guard Sirius!"Peter nodded, a determined look on his face. "What're you going to do, James?"James looked at Sirius with distaste. "I'm going to fix this mess he's put us in," his voice shook with anger. "I'll be back. Don't follow me."James took the map from Peter. He dashed down the stairs, past Lily and Marlene who shot questions that he left unanswered, past the Fat Lady, who called after him, all the way down to the doors that led to the grounds, to the Whomping Willow..."Alohomora!"The doors swung open with a groan and he took off, running as fast as he could. He could see Snape's billowing cloak as he got closer, he could see him running as well, running towards the thrashing tree. As James watched, Snape levitated a branch and glided it towards the opening; with a slight nudge, the tree stood still, and Snape disappeared down the passageway.No, thought James.He tried to run faster, but it was no use: the Whomping Willow still seemed as though it was miles away. With a wave of his wand, James sprang into the air and landed on all fours, taking on the form of a great, regal stag.He sprinted across the grounds with renewed speed, and he jumped again once he was close to the Whomping Willow; he turned back to his normal form in mid-air and flew past the jerking branches of the tree, right into the hole – he landed on his feet and pain flared all the way up to his waist, but he ignored it, he had to get to Snape, he could see his dark, greasy hair swishing from side to side now –"SNAPE!" bellowed James, "TURN BACK!"Snape whirled about, his wand at the ready, and saw that it was James. He sneered at him."Too late now, Potter," said Snape softly, his eyes glinting with malice. "By the end of the night, you and your friends will have been expelled."James yelled in frustration, closing in on him despite the fact that he was being held at wandpoint. "You don't understand! You have to run – run now before it's too late –"Snape fired a jet of yellow light at him, but James dodged, rolling to the ground and unsheathing his wand while he did it, and shot a curse of his own.Snape deflected it with a fast flick; another wave and James suddenly felt the ground sink at his feet. The earth was rising quickly, swallowing him whole, suffocating him –And then he thought of Remus, he thought of what he'd become, that Snape did not know what he was walking into –"Ascendio!" he gasped.He rose up into the air, following the movement of his wand arm, and he crawled out of the hole. He was losing sight of Snape. He had only a few moments before they would encounter a ruthless beast so terrifying, its victims would rather die than become one of their kind…James picked himself up and dashed through the tunnel."Snape!" he tried again. "Please, you don't know what you're doing –"Snape's laughter rang humorlessly throughout the passageway."You don't understand," pleaded James, "turn back – turn back now..."James couldn't see Snape at all now, he was hiding in the shadows again, and James had no idea where he was this time, but he didn't care, his only goal was to stop Snape from reaching the Shrieking Shack –"Sectumsempra!"James had not expected the curse and it hit him swiftly in the chest. Cuts and gashes appeared instantly, and his blood splattered the ground. James gasped and fell to his knees, he was yelling now, he couldn't concentrate through the pain..."No," he croaked out, struggling to breathe, "Snape, please..."But Snape was gone. He had gone through the shadows and entered the Shrieking Shack."No..."And then a scream pierced the night, reverberating through the tunnel and rolling across the grounds of Hogwarts, and then Moony howled: a sound so haunting James put his hands over his ears and curled into a ball, trying to block out the noise, but he got up, ignoring the pain and the loss of blood and he stumbled through the darkness and climbed the stairs of the shack.There he was: Snape, a terrified expression on his face, cornered by a wolfish beast with teeth as sharp as razors and claws as long as speartips, standing about twice as tall as him. Moony seemed surprised to see him there, but even more than that: he looked delighted, a kind of hunger present in his eyes. He bared his teeth at Snape and gnashed his mouth, savouring in the fear that exuded off of him.The werewolf pounced, and for a moment Snape froze, unable to do anything, but then James pointed his wand at his friend and yelled, "Confringo!"The blast was so powerful that the surrounding furniture caught fire and disintegrated. The shack groaned and shook. Moony whimpered, having been thrown to the wall, confused and hurt..."RUN, YOU IDIOT!" bellowed James at Snape, "ARE YOU BLIND? HE'S A WEREWOLF!"Snape gulped and practically flew towards James, not bothering to look back. He descended the stairs and James heard his footsteps grow fainter.James heard Moony shuffling and moaning behind him, recovering from his curse. He shot another spell at him that went wild, and he followed Snape out of the Shack.He raced back down towards the secret passage, nearly passing out from exhaustion, but then he heard a fearsome growl that made his hair stand on end. Adrenaline surged through his body. He thanked Merlin for the rigorous Quidditch exercises he had put himself through and found the strength to run.He had nearly caught up with Snape when suddenly another howl sounded – louder and more horrifying than the last. James and Snape glanced back, petrified, and saw only a creature of brown and black running towards them."Protego!" shouted James. The shield charm burst out of his wand, and he willed it to bend and curve, taking in the form of the werewolf –Moony shattered the shield as soon as he came in contact with it, but it had slowed him down. James shoved Snape forwards and they both bolted, a werewolf hot on their heels.Snape tripped over his own robes and took James down with him. The werewolf leapt past them, unable to stop himself and allowing his momentum to carry him. He skidded to a halt and turned to James and Snape, a grinning maliciously.James's mind was racing. Moony had blocked the only way out, and he was advancing slowly, his eyes on his prey, great black beads that bounced from James to Snape to James...And it pounced once again, a terrifying black mass of evil and dark magic, and James had no choice but to transform and meet it midair. The werewolf yelped in surprise as a familiar shape crashed into him, antlers pressing down on Moony's skin and trapping his legs over his head –Prongs gave a mighty shove and Moony slammed into the wall, dazed. James transformed back."Come on!" he snarled to Snape. "He's not going to stay down for long…"They both hurried off towards the Whomping Willow. The smell of grass and forest was getting stronger. There was nothing up ahead, they would make it, James was sure they would –And if I don't, thought James furiously, I'll kill Sirius in the afterlife. But the sound of four paws hitting the ground made him stop, and he turned around just in time to conjure another shield as Moony roared at him, biting and clawing at his spell.James held on, his wand steady and his face set, not about to let the big ugly wolf win."Go," said James through gritted teeth, his eyes boring holes into the wolf's face. "Get out of here."Snape remained silent, and to James, it felt as though he was about to protest, but he turned around and marched off. James narrowed his eyes at the werewolf."And you, Moony," he growled, "are going to sleep."He thrust his wand forward, forcing the shield charm to fly, the werewolf in front. He landed a good 10 feet away from James."Incendio!" exclaimed James, and he flicked his wand up. Instead of bursting out of his wand, fire erupted from the ground between him and the werewolf and rose up, creating a wall that separated them both.Moony snarled and gnashed his teeth, but he seemed unwilling to go through the flames."Scared of fire, huh?" muttered James, "Great…"Memories flooded his mind; he saw him and Sirius and Peter during their first successful Animagus transformation; he saw the Marauders laughing in their dorm, after telling Remus that it was going to be alright; he saw them walking down Hogsmeade, flirting with Madam Rosmerta as she passed them, not a care in the world…Despite what was happening, James smiled. He whirled his wand, and shouted his last spell. "Expecto Patronum!"The stag erupted from the tip of his wand and cantered around him. He waved his wand about his head, his Patronus following its movements, and then he pointed it straight at Moony.James's stag charged, reaching the flames and bending it so that it would cover its body; it ran straight at Moony, who gave a great yelp and tried to bite it, but James's stag was too quick. It shoved its flaming antlers straight at Moony's side, impaling it slightly, and then the werewolf gave a whimper of pain.For a moment they were a blur of fur and fire, clashing so fiercely that James winced through his Patronus, but Moony seemed unable to harm the stag, and the stag kept pounding the werewolf over and over again with fire and magic...The flaming stag reared on its back legs, towering over Moony, and then it lowered its head, about to strike again –But Moony fled towards where they had come from– back to the Shrieking Shack. Its howls were full of anguish, and James felt an immense pang of guilt.James's Patronus turned back to James, awaiting his command. He gave his wand a slow, sweeping wave, and the Patronus dissolved in a whirl of flames and silver.He stumbled back, now realizing how much pain he was in. The journey back to the castle grounds was long and tiring, but when he crawled through the hole, he found Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, and Madam Pomfrey all moving their way towards him.He collapsed on the ground. McGonagall gave a cry of surprise, but Madam Pomfrey had already whipped out her wand and conjured a stretcher, stripping James of his clothes. She dabbed at the wounds caused by Snape with dittany, and waved her wand over his various scars until Dumbledore said, "That's enough, Poppy."Dumbledore strode over to the unconscious James, pointed his wand at him, and said, "Rennervate."James's eyes flew open, and he looked at the Headmaster."Can you stand, James?" said Dumbledore gently.James gingerly moved his feet."I think so...""Then follow me. Now, please. This cannot wait."Pomfrey and McGonagall protested, saying that James needed rest, and he couldn't help but agree with them. Dumbledore, however, was having none of it."I don't think you understand the severity of the situation," said Dumbledore quietly, looking at the three of them. "I know you're tired, James, but you haven't been bitten, and neither has Snape. You must come with me."And so James followed the Headmaster all the way up to his office. They reached his brass door and entered his chambers.Inside, Snape was present, sitting completely still in one of the chairs, but when he noticed James and Dumbledore he sprang up to his feet."May I go now, Headmaster?" asked Snape.Dumbledore shook his head. "I'm afraid not, Severus. It is necessary that you be present. Sit down, please, James; this won't take long."James took a chair and set it as far away from Snape as he could dare. Dumbledore looked at them both from behind his great desk. He spoke first to Snape, telling him a brief summary of who Remus was. James pitched in, helping Dumbledore, trying to convince Snape that Moony was innocent..."...which is why," said Dumbledore, finally finishing, "you cannot tell anyone of this."Snape made to protest, but Dumbledore held up a finger for silence. "Mr Lupin has not done anything to warrant expulsion. Tell anyone, Severus, and the consequences shall be dire."Snape didn't look happy, but he nodded anyway. Dumbledore looked satisfied."To the Hospital Wing then, Severus." Snape rose and exited the office. Dumbledore turned to James."What do you think, James?"James forced his eyes open. He realized with a jolt that Snape now knew that he was an Animagus. Or had he not realized?"I think I should've made the Unbreakable Vow with him."Dumbledore made a noise of disapproval. "No, I don't think so. Severus already owes a great deal to you; an Unbreakable Vow would've tipped the scales, unbalanced your bond.""Bond?" asked James in disbelief, "I don't want a bond with him!""Severus now owes a life debt to you, James," said Dumbledore gently. "There may come a time in which you'll be very grateful to have that. Now, to other matters..."What did Mr Black tell you?"James was surprised, but he told the Headmaster of what Sirius had said to him. Dumbledore nodded, his eyes dim with disappointment."Sirius could have harmed you or Severus," said Dumbledore, "I'm afraid that he will have to face the consequences –""Surely not expulsion, sir?" butted James in, before he realized that he'd spoken out of turn. "Sorry, Professor. It's just – well, I'm sure he didn't mean to harm Snape. Or Remus, for that matter." James's words tasted bad in his mouth. Was he really sure of that? "He only wanted to scare Snape away...""I shall question him, and I shall assign a punishment fit for his actions," assured Dumbledore, "But the important thing is that neither you nor Severus were harmed, at least by Mr Lupin. You did a very brave, very heroic thing, James, which is why I'm giving you two awards to the school."James started, surprised, but Dumbledore went on. "One for outstanding bravery, showcasing true qualities as a Gryffindor, and the other for outstanding use of magic. Oh yes," added Dumbledore, smiling. "I could see what you were doing from above, James. I did not come to help because I was busy detaining Mr Black and Mr Snape, so I apologize greatly. Although, looking back, you hardly needed my help," Dumbledore looked at him appraisingly. "Very creative, thinking of combining those two spells.""Thank you, sir," said James sheepishly."I also think that a hundred points to Gryffindor are appropriate," finished Dumbledore.The clock chimed thrice, and Dumbledore jumped. "Dear Merlin, James, I'm sorry to have kept you this long. You're free to go to the infirmary."James made to leave."Oh, and James?" called Dumbledore, and James turned to him from near the door, "You make a fantastic stag."James did not go to the Hospital Wing. He couldn't imagine himself going to sleep alone after all that happened. His body was exhausted, having had to fight a fully-grown werewolf basically all by himself, and though his injuries had nearly gone and his bruises had vanished, he could still feel a sharp, stabbing pain in his chest when he breathed, over where Snape had cursed him.He lifted a hand and felt his scars. What had Snape cursed him with? As far as James knew, no mainstream curse caused injuries so bad that dittany was near useless. He didn't mind though; if anything, these scars served as a reminder to not let Sirius go too far.His mind was still swirling with thoughts as he dragged his feet over to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was empty and the lights were out. He climbed the stairs and found his way to his dormitory. Taking a deep breath, James knocked on the door.It opened immediately and he came face-to-face with Peter. He looked anxious to James, but when he saw who it was his face split into a huge grin."Prongs!" cried Peter, "There you are! Dumbledore said something..." He trailed off and pulled James inside, shutting the door behind him."Hey, Peter." James gave him a faint smile before turning to the mess that was Sirius Black, still trapped in his bedding.Sirius looked dreadful. His elegant hair was now messy and wet, as though Peter had splashed water on him. His wrists, James noted, were red with welts, courtesy of the bed curtains. His eyes were sunken and dark, and his normally handsome features were contorted into an ugly scowl."Explain yourself," snarled James.Sirius didn't answer. He looked away from James, instead choosing to stare at his empty bottles of alcohol."D'you have any idea of what you've done?" said James, his voice trembling. "You know Remus remembers everything that happens when he's in werewolf form. Why'd you do it?"Sirius stayed silent. James gave him a look full of disgust and undid the spell binding Sirius to the bed. Sirius instantly stretched his arms and massaged his wrists."Answer me, you git!" James spoke, his voice rising with every word. "What the bloody hell was going through your mind? Why'd you try to kill Snape?""I never meant to kill him!" muttered Sirius, now turning his back to him. "I just... wanted to teach him a lesson, that's all...""By using Remus as means of execution, yeah?" snapped James. "You're a coward. You're pathetic."Sirius whirled around, eyes ablaze. He was about to say something, but then thought better of it. He gritted his teeth, trying to calm himself down."I'm sorry, all right?""Why the fuck are you apologizing to me?" said James, scowl deepening and disappointment etched onto his face. "Save your words for Remus when he gets back."Sirius let out a growl of frustration. "I told you, I'm sorry, Prongs! Everything just... de-escalated-""There are boundaries, Sirius - boundaries that mustn't be crossed! You just told the worst possible person about Remus's secret, what do you say to that?"Silence ensued. Peter stood near the door, watching them argue, his mouth slightly open. He'd rarely seen James like this, as his temper was usually kept in control. Yet now... Peter knew that he was holding back, but he could feel the disappointment radiating off of him. He wasn't sure if he could take satisfaction in it – the cold fury that James was showing terrified Peter. His eyes darted nervously between James and Sirius, preparing himself for the fists they would surely launch.But James and Sirius continued to glare at each other, their eyes daggers and gripping their wands so tightly their knuckles were white. Finally, James sighed and looked away."I'm going to sleep," muttered James. "Maybe this will all turn out to be a bad dream... yeah..."He gave his wand a wave and settled into his bed. The curtains snapped shut and the lights went out.Sirius looked at Peter, a silent plea in his eyes. Peter only shook his head at him, and he, too, decided to call it a night.The next morning, James left first. He didn't bother changing into his school robes; he'd decided to skip classes altogether and accompany Remus in the Hospital Wing.He grabbed a small tray from the breakfast table and filled it with Remus's favourite foods: Hash browns and eggs and bread topped with marmalade and syrup. James didn't take any for himself. He couldn't bring himself to eat.James marched into the hospital wing at 8 o'clock. Only Remus and Madam Pomfrey were there, for which James was grateful. Madam Pomfrey gave him a nod and departed from Remus's side.James set the tray of food on top of the drawer next to Remus's bed."How're you feeling?" asked James.Remus looked terrible. There were numerous cuts on his face from where James had blasted him. He had bandages on his side, probably from where Prongs had stabbed him, and his hair was slightly singed.But Remus smiled tiredly. "I'm fine, I guess. Exhausted, but fine."James sat near the edge of his bed, watching silently as Remus ate his breakfast. He wanted so dearly to ignore the elephant in the room, but he couldn't. He was about to bring it up, but Remus beat him to it."How's Snape?"James gave him a look of surprise. "He's all right. Didn't get bitten, if that's what you mean. He cursed me when I was trying to pull him back, look."James was about to show him the scars, but then Remus shook his head."No thanks, James. I've seen enough blood for today."More silence followed. James didn't mind; he had half a mind to conjure a chair and doze off there, anyway."And Sirius?"James knew instantly what Remus meant. "I don't know," replied James helplessly. "I don't know why he did it. He knew the consequences, knew what he was getting himself into. I just... I don't understand him sometimes."Remus nodded as if he had expected his answer. James wondered whether Remus understood something he didn't, but he had no wish to find out."You remember everything?"Remus looked at him. "Yeah. It's a bit fuzzy, though. Most of the time I was trying to hold the wolf back, but you know what he gets like when he's in control. I don't have a say in anything. Best I could do was not to look."James nodded in understanding. "What're you gonna do about Sirius?"Remus closed his eyes for a moment before answering. "I don't know, James. I have no desire to talk to him. Or see him, to be honest. I never would've guessed that he'd do something like this."The rest of James's stay in the Hospital Wing was very uneventful. McGonagall came in once looking for him, but when she found that James was keeping Remus company, she bit her tongue to stop whatever she was going to say and calmly gave him and Remus the homework they had to do.James and Sirius wouldn't speak for many days afterwards. It was only when Sirius had pleaded, nearly in tears, for James and Remus to hear him out did he acknowledge him.James knew deep down that it would take a while for him to trust Sirius again. Sirius, his best mate, his brother- but when he said that in his head the memories of that night resurfaced and his feelings for Sirius broiled and hardened. It was just so out of character for him to do what he'd done to Snape.Eventually, James and Sirius repaired their friendship, and James felt that it was even stronger than before. He thought of it as a sword broken in battle: once strong, but had been dulled and crippled by the enemy, but made more powerful as it was reforged.Remus took a bit more time to learn to trust Sirius again, but eventually, he came around, for which Sirius was grateful. He would never admit it, but Sirius felt trapped, once the weight of his actions had sunken into him; he'd thought that he would lose the two best friends he had over a stupid prank.Well, it wasn't as much stupid as it was reckless and dangerous, anyway.

Chapter Two: PrologueJames entered the doors of the great hall for the first time as a sixth year with one goal in mind: apologize to Lily. He had had time to reflect over the summer, time he had used well. Lily's words washed over him once more, and he closed his eyes..."You think you're funny, but you're just an arrogant, bullying toerag, Potter."He inwardly cringed at himself. He hated to admit it, but it was those very words that had gotten to him, and it was Snape's insult at Lily that had shocked reality back into him: that no one was safe from Voldemort, and his influence had reached the school.He surveyed the scene before him – Dumbledore was smiling serenely at them, students were just beginning to get seated. He grabbed Sirius' and Peter's arms and led them over to the Gryffindor table. There they waited for the first years.Once the other students had seated themselves, the first years came barging in with Hagrid in front, soaking wet. One by one they were sorted, but James wasn't really listening. His mind wandered off– towards a fantasy land with the girl seated a few feet to the right of him...Dumbledore said his usual welcome speech once Wanton, Corvac had been sorted into Ravenclaw, and the food started to appear. James dug in.After an hour of eating and talking, Dumbledore once again stood up. "Now that our bellies are full," he began, "I'm afraid that it is time to go to bed. As fun and exhilarating as I'm sure your summers were, it is time to put it in the past and focus on school. Off to bed with you!"The wooden seats groaned as the weight of hundreds of students was suddenly lifted off it. James, Sirius, and Peter followed the Gryffindors, as Remus and Lily headed off to fulfil their duties as prefects.They entered the common room, packed to the brim with students of all years. Sirius shooed a third-year from an armchair who had fallen asleep in front of the fireplace and bid James and Peter sit down with him."That was downright mean of you, Padfoot," said James as he sat down on a comfy couch to the left of Sirius, and he watched the third year scramble up to the dormitories. Sirius shrugged easily and smiled."Had it not been for that act of selflessness, we wouldn't be sitting here, my dear James," Sirius's voice was dripping with pompousness and sarcasm, "Besides, why didn't he just go to the dormitories if he wanted to sleep? Doesn't make sense, really – Moony! Man of the hour."Remus Lupin entered the common room, scanned the mass of students, and finally spotted them in front of the fire. He ambled over to them."Or should Sirius say, wolf of the hour instead, seeing as tomorrow's a full moon?" said James, a smirk playing on his lips. Remus snorted at him and sat down at their feet, closing his eyes as he listened to Sirius ramble on about the chaos they were going to cause.James watched Sirius without really listening. His mind flitted back to the middle of the summer, to a miserable night that had been peppered with rain. He remembered hearing a knock on the door and he remembered answering it. He remembered how terrified Sirius had looked when he'd embraced him.I've run away, stated Sirius bluntly. I was hoping you'd give me a place to stay.It hadn't been much of a shock to either James or his parents. They knew what the 'Noble and Most Ancient House of Black' was like.It had been the most vulnerable that James had ever seen Sirius. James had spent many a summer night trying to calm Sirius down as he experienced his constant nightmares– he had held him, had consoled him, he had done his best to treat him like a brother.But was it enough? James knew Sirius was impulsive to the highest degree, and he had hoped that by showing him real familial love would, at the very least, shake him out of his old habits. Caring for Sirius, a Sirius that needed guidance from a person willing to give their love had certainly done that for James. He had, in the words of his father, become a better man.One day, he had sworn to himself, the people that had done this to Sirius, those stuck-up maniacs – they would pay.One day...Shaking his head, he focused on Sirius, who was still talking.They chatted well into the night, and by that time only 5 other people were left in the common room. Three of those happened to be Lily and his sort-of cousin Marlene, as well as Alice Fortescue, a nice, round-faced girl that was in a relationship with James's senior, Frank Longbottom. James had half a mind to go up to Lily and apologize right in front of her friends. Before he could muster the courage to even walk up to her, however, they abruptly got up and went to their dorms. This seemed to wake Remus up from his stupor."Reckon we should go up too, don't you think?" said Remus, struggling to keep his eyes open. The three boys agreed silently, and they too followed the girls up the dorms. They entered their room, where they found their usual four-poster beds with their trunks already underneath them."'Night, guys, see you in the morning." James waved his wand, and darkness fell on them as they lay on their beds to sleep.The next morning, James was the first to wake up. He glanced at Sirius sleeping on the bed next to him, and at Remus, who had fallen to the floor and was snoring soundly.James checked his wristwatch and decided that for once he was going to be early for a change. He showered quickly and went straight down to breakfast.On the way down to the common room, James looked around to find Lily and Marlene in front of the entrance with their bags, apparently about to go down to breakfast as well. Lily seemed to sense James' eyes on her and glanced back. She frowned at him, and with a disapproving look, exited first.Marlene looked at him pitifully and followed Lily out.Great start, James, he thought dejectedly, just get down to breakfast before anything else happens.And so he did. He found a seat at the Gryffindor table and loaded his plate with the usual breakfast: toast, eggs, and sausages.Half an hour in he glanced at his watch. 8:17. They should be coming in a few minutes.By 8:25 they still hadn't shown up, and James was starting to feel rather lonely when Marlene suddenly sat down next to him."Hey James," she said to him, "Any reason why you have a mismatched pair of shoes on?""What –," James glanced at his feet under the table. He had, indeed, mistaken his left shoe for Sirius's. "Oh, er – I dunno how that happened."Marlene's loud giggle passed through his ears. "I have your schedule. And everyone else's. Professor McGonagall gave them to me, don't forget to give them to the boys."You know," she continued, "I don't think waking up early suits you. Are you that desperate?"James stared at her."Oh, don't go around playing dumb, James," said Marlene impatiently, "It doesn't really suit you either. I know why you're down here without your usual cavemen. Or at least come up with an accurate guess.""Oh yeah?" said James, not about to let that deter him. "Guess away, then. I really couldn't care less, Marls." Marlene paused for a moment and looked at him incredulously."But you do care, James," said Marlene, "I'm not stupid, and she's not either, so why don't you get over it and talk to her?""What are you yapping –""You want to apologize, don't you?" interjected Marlene. "Lily appears to be under the delusion that you are incapable of feeling remorse, but I know you better. Prove her wrong. And might I advise," she added, as she stood up, "that you do it quickly before your little friends get here. Au revoir, James, love."And she left, leaving a very confused James behind her.Realizing he had about 5 more minutes before Lily would go to class (she was always early, that girl), he steeled his nerves and ambled over to where Marlene and Lily were. From what he could gather, they were about to leave the Great Hall. James summoned his inner Gryffindor and called out to her as she began walking to the doors."Evans! Hey – Evans!" James said, loud enough for her to glance back, but she kept on walking, "Lily! Please, I need to talk to you."That made her stop. James glanced at Marlene standing next to her, and she gave him a small smile. She murmured something to Lily and went off to wait for her a few feet from the door.Slowly, Lily turned around, and her eyes met James's."What is it, Potter?" she asked flatly. James decided that it was now or never. He took a deep breath before spewing out his thoughts."I just – I mean, I know how you must feel about me now, and I don't blame you. I've realized how much of an idiot I've been, and – ""Just get to the point, Potter.""I wanted to apologize," stated James quickly. "For everything – what I've put you through, especially last year, and all the years before that... on behalf of my friends, mainly Sirius." He took another deep breath before continuing, "I'm sorry for picking on you, and I'm sorry for what Snape said. If I hadn't riled him up... well, I guess you'd still be friends. I was immature, and a bully, and... well, an arrogant toerag."James waited for Lily – who seemed a little surprised – to speak. At last, she opened her mouth."I – well... thanks, Potter," she said quietly and averted her eyes. "You don't have to apologize for what Snape said, though. You didn't force him.""It didn't sound like that when you were chewing me out in the lake," said James softly, but his stomach was swooping now."Yeah, well... it was one of those 'heat of the moment' sort of things, you know?" said Lily. "I blamed you for a long time. I'm sorry about that."An awkward silence followed, punctuated by James, who had noticed his fellow friends near the doors. Marlene greeted them enthusiastically, especially Sirius."Well, I'll see you around, then, Evans," said James, who had been spotted by Remus.Lily glanced behind her, at Marlene who was talking animatedly with Sirius, at Alice, who was talking with Mary Macdonald and Emmeline Vance, at all of their friends."Yeah. I'll see you around, Potter." Lily strode over to Marlene and pulled her by the hand towards the direction of the Transfiguration classroom, their first class of the day."Oi, Prongs, have you seen my left shoe?" called Sirius as they made their way over to him."No!" James answered back, and subtly waved his wand and transfigured his shoes to match.Sirius looked disappointed once he and the rest of the Marauders had joined James. "Oh. I was hoping you'd seen them. Well, you don't mind me taking one of yours, right?""No, I don't mind," said James quickly, "look, let's all go to class. I'm not feeling all that well.""What was that all about, Prongs?" asked Remus as they walked towards Transfiguration, "She didn't even look annoyed. I'd daresay that she looked slightly happy!""It wasn't anything, Moony," said James, who was looking at Lily's dark red hair swinging side to side as she vanished from his view. "I just apologized, is all..."James endured the relentless teasing that followed, mostly from Sirius and Peter. It still hadn't stopped when they entered Professor McGonagall's classroom. Ignoring his friends, he took a quick look at Lily, who was seated to the right of the class.There was a slight blush appearing on her cheeks as she was conversing with Marlene and Alice, who had entered right after James had. He couldn't hear their conversation, and he surprised himself when he found that he had no desire to. Once or twice he felt as though he had heard his name coming out of one of their mouths, but then Professor McGonagall entered, and everyone quieted."Good morning, my fellow Gryffindors," the stern Professor McGonagall said. "Now, might I remind you that you have your NEWT tests next year, so be sure..."In the following months, James and Lily had started to become acquainted, more friendly. Sometimes, James felt as though he could feel Lily looking at him when he wasn't looking back, but when he swivelled his head around to her direction, she quickly looked away. James smiled inwardly whenever this happened. He and Lily had been on a first-name basis ever since the first week of the school year had ended. He knew that she was beginning to see him as a friend, but he didn't let that discourage him. On the contrary, James was elated to have finally conversed with her in a friendly, civil way.James's sixth year proved to be one of his most enjoyable years, what with winning the Quidditch Cup and excelling at school, not to mention executing a prank of enormous proportions involving Professor Dumbledore and the hundreds of House Elves stationed in the kitchens, as well as a giant dragon made of hundreds of fireworks. To top it all off, the Marauders had finally finished the Marauder's Map early on in the first term. It was to be, in Sirius's words, The greatest legacy we will ever have left.November came quickly, and with it, so did everybody's favourite sport: Quidditch.Even though McGonagall had told them – in her cat-patterned nightgown, no less – to quiet down over 45 minutes ago, the party in the Gryffindor common room didn't seem like it was slowing down, and rightly so: Gryffindor had smashed Slytherin in the first match of the season with a score of 330-20. James Potter, the house had decided, was the hero of the Quidditch pitch, having scored nearly half of their goals. Lily Evans sat on one of the sofas close to the fire with Mary MacDonald, as her other housemates were busy either getting drunk or flirting with the Quidditch players.The wireless played a slow, melancholy song that Lily found much too appropriate in regards to her current mood. She sat, dejected, trying to ignore her feelings as she watched James get kissed by 5th year Penny Pendleton. Mary made noises of disapproval next to her, though she knew better than to talk to an angry, jealous Lily.At that exact moment a boy wearing a Gryffindor jacket as well as scarlet-and-gold face paint plopped down next to her, two bottles of firewhisky in one hand and a shot glass in the other. Mary glanced at him, and, with a last forlorn look at Lily, departed from the sofa.Lily sighed. "What do you want, Black?"Sirius Black gave a bark of laughter as she acknowledged him. "To get absolutely pissed, of course. That, and to get you hammered."Lily turned her head to look at him, her eyebrows raised. "And why in Merlin's grey beard would I try to get hammered?"Sirius shook his head. "Unbelievable, Evans," he said, "I thought your parents were Scottish? Don't Scots have a reputation for being drunkards?""Most Scots do," admitted Lily, "but not this one."Sirius shoved a bottle of alcohol under her nose. "Get started, then."Lily pushed it back with a disapproving humph. "I told you, Black, I'm not in the mood to get drunk. You know the lies I told McGonagall so as to avoid getting that confiscated?" Her eyes wandered over to James, who was now attempting to dance with Marlene."Pretty please, Evans?" asked Sirius in a sing-song voice, "do it for your best mate, Sirius Black?"When Lily stayed silent, Sirius looked over to where she was glaring. He chuckled slightly, realizing what the problem was now. Lily's knuckles whitened as she gripped the sofa tighter."He's having fun, isn't he?"Sirius looked at the redhead. "I guess."Lily dropped her gaze and turned to Sirius instead."James Potter," she said the name like it was an incantation. "When this party's over give him a real smack upside the head, will you, Black?"Sirius shook his head in exasperation. "Are you actually jealous, Evans?"Lily continued to glare at him. Sirius sighed and took a swig from his bottle of firewhisky. "Look. Whatever's happening between ol' Pendleton and Prongs is most likely one-sided. James hasn't ever mentioned liking her.""And why would I care about that?"Sirius winked at her. Lily narrowed her eyes at him and snatched the unopened second bottle of whisky from Sirius's hands.He gave a whoop of joy and was about to hand her the shot glass when suddenly she uncorked the bottle and took a long drink from it. Sirius stared at her, wide-eyed, as she lowered her drink."Blimey, Evans," he said, impressed, "I didn't know you had it in you."Lily gave him the finger and drank some more, this time emptying the whole bottle. She set it down on the table next to the fire, her hands trembling slightly."You don't know a lot of things about me, Black," she mumbled. "Give me more.""More what?""More firewhisky, you stupid git."Sirius laughed and passed her his own unfinished bottle. She drank a generous amount before she retched, and lowered the drink.A few minutes later, she was sobbing and muttering gibberish, cursing James and Penny and everyone in the common room, but Sirius held her close, whispering words of encouragement and agreeing with whatever she said. Sirius may have had the reputation for being careless and a bit of a ladies' man, but he was an expert on women."Oh, Merlin," she hiccuped, her eyes only half-open, "I think I might like James!"Sirius snorted. "You think?"Lily turned her head slowly at him, frowning. "W-what do you – hic – do you mean?"Sirius couldn't believe how drunk she was. He grabbed her bottle of firewhisky, and, after enduring verbal abuse, tossed it over to Remus, who caught it without a second glance."Why'd you – hic – do that?" asked Lily, enraged, "That stuff's actually good, Black!"Sirius rolled his eyes. "Of course it is, love, but I think you've had enough for the night."Lily then turned her whole body to face him, and she jabbed a finger to his chest."Have not!""Merlin, Evans, stop acting like a toddler, will you?"Lily muttered a few more choice words at him, but after a few seconds gave up and instead leaned her head on to his shoulder.There was nothing romantic in the gesture, decided Sirius, and so he threw an arm around her to support her. Lily was sobbing again, but this time it was much more controlled."All those years when James told me he fancied me, and then he figures that he doesn't and starts – hic – kissing every girl in sight," she muttered angrily. Sirius shook his head."Evans, Prongs has only ever had eyes for you – yes, you, you overgrown duck. He realized that you didn't like him back, though I know that's not true now –""I don't fancy him," hissed Lily."You just told me a few moments ago that you did," countered Sirius, a frivolous little smile playing at his lips.Lily looked away and muttered some more about him. "Maybe I did. Doesn't change the fact that he kissed that wench Pendleton –""No, he didn't, flower," said Sirius patiently, "I told you, Pendleton probably cornered him and took her chance while Prongs was drunk.""Then why did he look so – hic – ecstatic about it?""He probably didn't even realize," said Sirius. "Most blokes don't, when they're drunk."Lily sighed and curled into a ball, snuggling up to Sirius."You really think he fancies me?"Sirius looked down at her. "I know so, love. James fancies you more than ever. The last time he had a serious relationship was –""Stop it," chided Lily, "I don't want to know."They sat in silence, holding on to each other and laughing as they watched James turn his back to Penny as she came in for round two."I never really hated him, you know," said Lily quietly, her voice quite steady. Apparently, she wasn't quite as drunk as Sirius had thought. "I always… sort of liked it when he flirted with me. I was disappointed when he stopped."Sirius gave her a lopsided smile. "If you want, I could tell Prongs to pick up where he left off."Lily looked mortified. "Merlin, no. I'm sad, but it's something that I can – hic – live without."Then suddenly Lily rounded on him. She slapped his chest – hard. Sirius doubled over, surprised."Ow," muttered Sirius, "that hurt, Evans. What gives?"Lily held his gaze. "You will not tell anyone of this, least of all James!""Yeah, yeah," said Sirius, this time fully intending to keep his promise, "I won't. You probably won't even remember this happened next morning. Firewhisky does that to people."The radio ended its sad song, then belched out a wild tune that caused the entirety of the Gryffindor common room to cheer and take to the dance floor.Lily and Sirius laughed and they both stood up. She held a hand out to him."Care to dance, Black?"Sirius gave her his trademark smirk. "Only if you promise to dance with Prongs later."Lily matched his smile."I promise."

Chapter Three: The New HeadsOn one lazy summer morning found James, Sirius, and Remus sitting at the table for breakfast.Or rather- sleeping seemed much more appropriate a word. Sirius's head was face down on his plate of eggs and bacon, and James was leaning back on his chair, his mouth slightly open. Only Remus appeared to be slightly awake; his eyes kept opening and closing every few moments. They were all thoroughly exhausted, having spent most of last night playing three-way Quidditch.James's parents, Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, suddenly entered the room, where they found 3 boys all sleeping at the table. Fleamont and Euphemia glanced at each other, and with a nod, they took out their wands and shot jets of water at each of the boys' faces.James, Sirius, and Remus woke up with startled shouts."What was that for?" muttered James irritably, as he wiped his glasses with his shirt."You were sleeping," said Euphemia lightly, "we've just received news that your Hogwarts letters are coming today.""Hogwarts letters?" mumbled Remus, who was still having trouble keeping his eyes open. Euphemia smiled at him."Yes, dear, so will you all wake up? We're going to Diagon Alley after."Fleamont suddenly glanced up at the large, stained-glass window. "Speaking of letters..." he said softly and trailed off. He gave his wand a wave and the window swung open, allowing the owls to enter.Three tawny owls bore letters addressed to each of the boys. James realized with a slight frown that his letter had a slight bulge to it. The owls hooted, and all three took off collectively, each taking a piece of Sirius's bacon with them.James ripped open his envelope and out fell a shiny, shield-shaped crest that landed on his lap. James was confused; why had Dumbledore given him a new Quidditch Captain badge? If he remembered correctly, it was still on top of his drawer. He took it and flipped it over. He instantly made a loud, retching noise that made his parents and friends look at him concernedly."Something wrong, James?" said Sirius. James tried to shake his head, but then changed his mind and nodded. Remus looked at the badge in his hands and laughed."Ickle James has been made Head Boy," teased Remus. James's parents looked at him in surprise."Head Boy?" said Sirius incredulously, and then he laughed as well. "Another disciplinarian, then! Oh, Peter and I will have so much fun corrupting you, Prongs!"James looked at him scathingly and pulled out his letters from the envelope. There were three this time- one welcoming him back to Hogwarts, complete with a list of schoolbooks, the second one from McGonagall, outlining his upcoming meeting on the train ride with the other prefects, and the last from Dumbledore, who had written to him personally. He read Dumbledore's letter first.Dear James Potter,I'm sure by now that you have found the badge enclosed in the envelope. I am also sure that you must be surprised and in a bit of shock. The position of Head Boy is a prestigious one, so let me be the first to congratulate you on receiving it. I'll admit I was surprised when Professor McGonagall handed me your name when I inquired to the teachers to give me suggestions for the Head students- but I am confident that I have chosen well, given that you have shown great leadership skills and the drive to do what's right; I am, of course, talking about the incident with Mr. Snape and the Whomping Willow.Once again, I congratulate you on your receiving of the Head Boy position. I am sure that you and the Head Girl, Lily Evans, will work wonderfully together.Yours,Professor A. P. B. W. Dumbledore"Lily?" said Remus as he read the letter from over James's shoulder. He glanced at Sirius and stifled a laugh. "That should be... interesting."James gave a snort, and, not asking anyone in particular said, "But why on earth would Dumbledore choose me?""Don't be stupid James, I probably would have chosen you too," answered Remus, an impatient note in his voice.James stared at him."What?" said Remus, and stared back to humor him, "it's true! You're a natural leader, James. You're cool under pressure, not to mention you already have experience as Quidditch Captain. It's not so different from that," he added as an afterthought, "just think of the whole school as a team now. Just... you know, without the matches and parties. And a whole lot more responsibility."James pondered over Remus's words. On the one hand, he was utterly perplexed at why Dumbledore had chosen him, him, probably one of the biggest troublemakers in Hogwarts history, over Remus. On the other, he was grateful that the position had not gone to someone like Snape. At least now he could keep an eye on anyone that abused their powers.Like you won't, said a nasty little voice from inside his head.I won't, cried a different, stronger voice defiantly, I'm done taking everything for granted!James shook his head, and without another word, left the table, leaving his friends and parents chortling.James raced up the stairs to his room and summoned a blank piece of paper and a quill. He sat down on his chair and straightened the paper before writing, Dear Lily, and then his mind blanked. What on earth was he going to write? He'd never written to Lily before.He decided that he was going to keep it short and simple.Dear Lily,Knowing that you're the Head Girl, I'm writing to you to ask for advice. Dumbledore probably mentioned that I was Head Boy in your letter. And, to be perfectly honest with you, Lily, I'm nervous. I'm a troublemaker, no one's going to take me seriously! I just want to make sure that you're okay with all this. I'm easy to replace, but you're the only option for Head Girl.Now, just what exactly does a Head Boy do? I'm not really familiar with prefect duties, I only know that you go on rounds every few days. I've accompanied Remus on some before.Your friend,James PotterHe rolled the paper into a tight scroll and handed it to Morgoth, his hawk owl. He nipped at his fingers affectionately before taking off to Lily's. James wondered whether he would find it.Going down the stairs, he braced himself from the taunts he knew would surely come. Sirius and Remus grinned evilly at him from the breakfast table."Hello there, Head Boy, sir," said Sirius, "I think we're going to have a lot of fun this year.""Ohh, yes," said Remus, a mischievous glint in his eyes, "this is payback for all you did to me when I became prefect, Prongs..."James gulped and smiled nervously.Lily Evans raced up her room to tell her friends Marlene and Alice the good news: she had become Head Girl! After a half-hour of her parents questioning her about her position, Lily had finally escaped their clutches, and just in time too: Petunia had arrived from Vernon Dursleys' place.Lily was just about to retrieve a pen and paper from her drawer when suddenly she heard a tap-tap-tap coming from outside the window. Whirling around, she was surprised to be greeted by a handsome owl she had never seen before. She flicked her wand and the window opened, allowing the bird to hop into her room."Now just who are you from?" wondered Lily aloud, and she saw that it had a scroll gripped tightly around one of its talons. She took it from the owl, who hooted importantly.Lily quickly unfurled the scroll to reveal that it was from one James Potter, whom she'd known had become Head Boy after Dumbledore told her in his letter. Fighting down the nervous tingles in her stomach, she read the letter over twice before a small smile set on her face.Deciding that Marlene and Alice's letters could wait, she responded back to James.Dear James,Congrats on becoming Head Boy! To answer your question, the Head students basically control the prefects, as in telling them when to go on rounds, holding meetings, not so different from Quidditch Captain stuff. As for your thoughts on whether or not I'd be happy with you as my coworker, I wouldn't have wanted to work with anyone else. You've changed over the past year, and you're actually a decent human being. (Lily smiled at that part).The students will take you seriously- if anything, more seriously than they will me. You're a natural leader, not to mention that you're popular with the student body.Your friend,Lily EvansShe read it over a couple of times, looking for mistakes. When she was finally satisfied she looked 'round for James's owl, who was near the window. Lily sealed the letter in a tight envelope and gave it to him.The owl hooted once more, and then took off.Over the next few weeks, Lily would receive numerous letters from James, all asking questions about his Head Boy duties. One memorable letter stuck in Lily's mind, something about how he was worried that the first-years would be scared of him. Unbeknownst to James, his words had slightly melted Lily's heart.On the morning of September the 1st, Lily took off for King's Cross and boarded the Hogwarts Express, feeling nervous yet excited at the same time.

So there you go! This is sort of a filler chapter, and I do apologize as it's quite long. You might find inconsistencies in between paragraphs- again, I apologize. I'd already written this chapter before, but I wasn't satisfied with it and recycled some of the parts that I did like. I'm much happier with it now. The previous version had wayyyy too many adjectives to describe things as simple as common rooms. Read and review, and I hope you like it!Chapter Four: A Train of Two ThoughtsThe scarlet engine billowed steam out of its chimney that drifted off towards the platform and covered the would-be-passengers in its silver haze. James and Sirius stood near the barrier between this world and the other; they had just gone through."You go ahead," said James to Sirius a little while later. "I have Head duties to attend to.""Well, aren't we being modest about it," Sirius rolled his eyes at him. "I hope this won't stop you from pranking –""Sirius, you know full well that nothing could ever stop me," James smirked. "We just have to be extra careful this year…""Noted," Sirius took hold of his trolley. "Any chance of me receiving a parting gift from the esteemed Head Boy before he starts ordering everyone around?"James slapped his shoulder. "You know it's not like that, you prat. As for the gift…"He felt in his robes and pulled out a single piece of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Bean. "There you go, Padfoot. You can't say no to this."Sirius laughed and popped the bean into his mouth. His eyes widened in surprise; apparently, it tasted quite good."What about my present, then?" asked James."I'll give it to you once you're done with your meeting," promised Sirius, already rolling his trolley towards the train, "I promise it's much better, Prongs!"James shook his head. "It better not be a turd, Sirius!"They shared one last laugh before Sirius vanished out of sight; James smoothed his robes and cleaned his badge with the cuff of his sleeve. He started his march through the platform, inspecting the train and helping the younger kids lift their trunks, all the while secretly hoping to meet someone.Lily Evans was late. She couldn't believe herself. The one year in which it mattered – and she had ruined it!She wasn't the only culprit, though. That morning, after she'd woken up, Petunia had – for some unfathomable reason – decided that she was going to be taking an hour-long shower. Why she'd done that, Lily had no idea, though she suspected some of it had to do with her accidentally turning her sister's hair bright orange the night before.It had been an accident, really, but Petunia was being so damned insufferable. Lily had apologized and had offered to change it back. She no longer had the trace, after all, so there was no problem with whipping her wand out and recolouring Petunia's hair, right?Except, as far as Petunia was concerned, she wanted nothing to do with magic. Petunia had gotten into her car that morning wearing a shawl over her head as she headed to work at Grunnings, a drilling company.Then, Lily reminisced as she kissed her parents goodbye and made towards the magical barrier, just before she'd boarded her dad's car, she'd come across Snape.That had also been an accident, but her insides still squirmed uncomfortably at the sight of him, and not in a good way. Her heart still broke whenever she remembered the way he had called her a Mudblood, that day at the lake – the word that was used to describe people like her, like Lily: dirty blood, unworthy blood, mud's blood.They had exchanged no words during their encounter. Lily had merely glared at him, betraying no emotions, daring Snape to say something – but he remained glued to the spot, staring back with those empty eyes of his; eyes she had once thought she knew so well, that had once been full of childish joy and affection but were now sunken and hard.Lily shook her head, clearing her thoughts. She had passed through the barrier. According to her watch, it was five to eleven, so she had no time to patrol the platform. What McGonagall would say after she'd learned that Lily had slacked off in her duties as Head Girl, she didn't want to think about.A few feet in front of her, she heard a voice speak softly and gently. It was a voice she knew all too well, though she had to admit, it sounded rather nice when he wasn't yelling himself silly.Pushing past a family, she saw James.Her vision tunnelled slightly. He looked quite good, if she said so herself. He was sitting on the platform, arms folded, and staring up at a young boy – he couldn't have been more than 11."...it's going to be all right," James kept on saying. "It's scary at first, I know, but once you get there, you'll never want to leave. Hogwarts does that to people."The boy sniffed and nodded. James, satisfied, got up."What if I don't have any friends?" the boy asked, sounding scared. James smiled and put an arm on the boy's shoulder."You will, Marlon," he insisted. "Because Hogwarts does that, too – it brings people together and builds lifelong friendships. Don't you worry; there are tons of muggle-borns just like you that don't know a thing about magic. That doesn't mean that they'll be worse than the people who grew up with it."James glanced back, as if he had felt Lily's eyes on him. He smiled widely and turned around, steering Marlon around him so that Lily could fully see him."This is Lily Evans, Marlon," explained James to the first year. "She's a muggle-born too, and she's one of the best witches I know.""She is?" asked Marlon with wide eyes."Sure am," said Lily, stepping forwards so that she could smile clearly at him. "It was hard for me, too, at first. But then I got sorted into Gryffindor and met my best friends, and ever since, I couldn't wait to go back to Hogwarts during the summer.""Wow, that's something!" The little boy's eyes were shining, and he no longer looked as scared."She's also Head Girl, just like me," added James. At that, Marlon's head whipped around to her chest and his eyes found the badge. He let out a loud gasp. James and she shared a knowing smile.Right then, the train whistle sounded, and the conductor yelled, "All aboard the Hogwarts Express!""We should get up now," said James. Marlon nodded and climbed up the steps. James turned to Lily and raised his eyebrows."What?" asked Lily innocently."Didn't see you while I was patrolling, so I can only assume one thing – you were late," teased James. Lily rolled her eyes and pushed him so that he was forced to board the carriage."Let's just get to the meeting, James." He smiled one last time, and they headed towards the front carriage."That was quite sweet of you," said Lily a few moments later. James turned his neck to look at her."What was that, Lil?""I just thought that it was thoughtful of you to comfort that first year," muttered Lily.James grinned. "It was, wasn't it?""You had to ruin the moment, Potter," Lily sighed. James slowed his pace so that he was behind her. "Just take the compliment, will you?"She heard his deep laugh behind her. "Only joking, Lily. Thanks.""You're quite welcome."They reached the front carriage as the train started moving. Opening the door, they found that they were the only ones that had arrived.They settled themselves in the chairs on top of the dais – James had transfigured his to a squishy–looking armchair. Lily declined when he offered to do the same for her. Remus Lupin came in a few moments later, smiling at both her and James; he took a seat at the very front."So, had a good summer, Remus?" Lily began."Oh yes, we managed to get into James's mum's study and found a couple of things…"The three of them made light conversation when the door opened suddenly, and the rest of the prefects filed in. Some took a double-take at James, noted Lily, but otherwise, the prefects stayed silent. She noticed a few familiar faces: she spotted 7th year Benjy Fenwick, a soft-spoken Hufflepuff that had a talent for Charms. She smiled at Dorcas Meadowes, a Ravenclaw one year below her whom she had previously tutored in Potions. She saw various others, including Regulus Black, Sirius's brother, and Fortuna Greengrass, a Slytherin in Snape's year."So," said James nervously as he stood up, once the prefects had settled down. "As you can see, Lily and I are the new Heads. And I know you may be wondering how I got here," and he forced a little more strength into his voice, "but what's done is done. I can't say that I expected it, and Merlin knows Dumbledore was slightly mad when he chose me –" there were a few titters at that, and Lily rolled her eyes beside him, but she was smiling, "– but I'll try to be a Head Boy worthy of the title. I won't let any of you down."He ran a hand through his hair and glanced at Lily, who was a bit taken aback from how he had ended his little speech but composed herself quickly."To business, then," she said and stood up. She then proceeded to explain the usual rules that prefects had to follow and enforce. She eyed the Slytherin prefects, but mostly Regulus, who had a slight scowl on his face. He looked very like Sirius. Half an hour later, after answering a multitude of questions, and having had James back her up a couple of times, she decided to wrap things up by giving out their normal instructions."The older prefects have done this a hundred times: patrol the train, Gryffindors the first carriage, Ravenclaws the next; Hufflepuff, I'm sorry, but it's your turn to patrol carriages four and five, and Slytherins the last. New prefects, just watch your seniors and do whatever they're doing. If you encounter any problems, kindly report back to James or myself. Reign in the younger kids, if you don't mind, and take care to maintain order between the older students as well."She looked at James, who was sitting comfortably. He gave an approving nod and Lily quickly turned back towards the prefects."That's all, I guess," she said, "Dismissed."Lily sidled into Marlene and Alice's compartment once she'd finished the meeting and found it to be occupied not only by her aforementioned friends but by her other roommates as well.She smiled at Mary and Emmeline as she sat across from them. The Trolly Witch had already passed by, she was sad to hear, but fortunately, her friends had stocked up in sweets that they were glad to share with Lily."So, Lily," asked Marlene in a sickeningly sweet voice. "What's sharing duties with James like?""A bit odd, I suppose," she answered, "but he's nice most of the time. We're getting along fine."At this, her friends looked at each other and fell about laughing. Lily, confused as to what was going on, stared at them. "What's so funny?""Oh, nothing, love," snorted Emmeline. "It's just – well, it's a bit ironic, don't you think?""Not really, no.""Lils, you're hopeless," exclaimed Mary despairingly. "How thick can you get?""You're all crazy.""Yeah, but not as crazy as you are for one certain Head Boy," said Marlene, wiggling her eyebrows suggestively. Lily felt her face heat up."I am not!""Oh, I think you are, Lily dear," chortled Alice. "You just haven't come to terms with it yet."Lily threw a Chocolate Frog at her.They spent the rest of the train ride bickering back and forth, but not before changing subjects as quickly as Lily could hope, for their words held a semblance of truth to her.She wasn't stupid. She'd noticed the emotions she felt whenever James was near her. She liked this James – the James who was smart and funny and kind, who teased Sirius and Marlene with her, who always valued her opinion before anyone else's, who listened to her vent about Petunia, who shared looks with her whenever Professor Binns had started to drone on about the Giant Rebellion led by Porphyrion, Greatest of the Giants...All right, maybe Lily did like him more than she had realized. But crazy? Definitely not. She congratulated herself on her little lie."We'd better change, I can see Hogwarts," said Mary Macdonald after a conversation concerning the recent attacks on Ministry strongholds.Lily sighed to herself. Whether this year would turn out better or worse than last year, she had no idea.Shaking these thoughts out of her head, she opened her trunk and changed into her robes.The train slowed down and finally stopped. The sound of many hundreds of feet stomping was heard all throughout the carriage as everybody hurried to get their bags and pets assembled. Lily exited the compartment first, looking for James.She found him already outside of the train – how he'd gotten there so quickly she had no idea, but she pushed past the crowd thronging near the doors and descended onto the platform.She gasped quietly as the cold of the night air stung her face. They marched back and forth, leaning down so that they could see whether there were any problems with the train. When Lily found none, she headed back to James."Everything all right?" he bellowed. The sound of the steam engine made him barely audible."Seems fine!" she shouted back. James waved his arms wildly to signal the conductor that it was safe to open the carriages.Students poured out of the train doors. Hagrid loomed over them, carrying a large lantern, calling out the familiar cry, "Firs' years, firs' years over here!" and when he spotted Lily, he boomed, "All right, Lily? Excited abou' being Head Girl, eh?"Lily grinned and waved. "Hi, Hagrid! I'm fine, how're you?""I'm doin' fantastic! See ye at the feast!"A large group of small students separated themselves from the main crowd and followed Hagrid to the Black Lake. Lily turned to James."Shall we get on the carriages, then?"James nodded. He looked different when he was serious. "Yeah, let's get on."The first stagecoach rolled up to them, pulled by what Lily knew to be thestrals. James got on first and helped Lily up. She scanned the students waiting out behind her, talking amongst themselves. Then slowly, the coach started to move, following the road to the castle.She and James didn't talk much. They passed through the gates of the grounds, where, at last, Hogwarts emerged: a towering black castle barely visible in the dark of night, ringed by turrets and high towers. Some windows were blazed fiery bright above them.The bells of the carriage jingled and it came to a halt near the stone steps that led up to the front doors. Lily exited first and entered with James, where they found Professor McGonagall waiting."Potter. Evans." McGonagall had a satisfied look about her face. "No troubles, I presume?""None, Professor," answered James. McGonagall nodded approvingly."Excellent. Now, you two: Professor Dumbledore wishes to see you after the feast." The sound of wooden wheels outside of the Entrance Hall made her pause. "It has been a long time since both Head Students originated from the same house, much less from Gryffindor. I'm very proud of you two." Professor McGonagall then smiled – a genuine expression of happiness. "I'll be on my way. The password is Lifesaver!"They made their way over to the Great Hall's double doors, which were already open. The four house tables were empty, but not for long. Lily glanced up and saw the starless black ceiling, which mirrored the sky outside. She and James settled down at the Gryffindor table.Soon hundreds of students began to enter the Great Hall. Marlene and Alice, flanked by the rest of the Gryffindor boys, spotted her sitting with James and went over to join them. Lily felt the wooden bench lower itself as her fellow Gryffindors sat down. She turned to Marlene."You have a brother, don't you, Marls?""Yeah," Marlene answered distractedly, having just finished listening to Sirius talk about who-knew-what. "Cygnus. I do hope he gets Gryffindor."Hagrid suddenly appeared at the staff table, which meant that the first years had already crossed the lake. Sure enough, a few moments later, Professor McGonagall entered, carrying an ancient-looking wizard's hat, heavily patched and frayed: the Sorting Hat. The first years scrambled in after her, soaking wet and looking scared.The Great Hall died down. The first years lined up facing the students, and Professor McGonagall placed the Sorting Hat on a stool. A rip opened near its brim, and it began to sing.Lily drowned out the noise of the hat; she'd never liked its songs. She clapped loudly with the rest of the students once it had finished, and waited for the first years to get sorted.Professor McGonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and called out the first name."Abernathy, Marlon."The small boy that she and James had encountered on the station stumbled forwards and put on the Hat. It covered nearly half of his face and Lily could only see the tip of his nose jutting out. Sirius laughed loudly from across her, and she gave him a venomous look. The Hat stayed silent for a moment, then the rip near the brim opened and it shouted:"Hufflepuff!"Slowly, the long line of first-years thinned. Marlene's brother, Cygnus McKinnon, was sorted into Gryffindor."Well done, Cyg!" called Marlene as the blond-haired, knobbly-kneed boy sat down shakily at the Gryffindor table.And finally, Welshter, Alexander was called into Slytherin, and Dumbledore stood up. Lily smiled at him subconsciously, and Dumbledore turned to her and smiled serenely back."Welcome!" beamed the great wizard Dumbledore, "welcome all, to another year of magical education. I won't bore you with an old man's rambling, so I'm keeping this short and simple: the Forbidden Forest, as always, is forbidden –," his piercing blue eyes regarded the Marauders next to Lily, but his mouth twitched slightly, "– Zonko's products are banned and magic is not allowed in the corridors, but seeing as none of you listen to any of those rules, I don't see any reason to list anymore other than the obvious. Dine well, and here's to another magical year!"The students repeated the toast.Lily's mouth watered as plates upon plates of the most lavish food imaginable appeared before her. She grabbed a platter and helped herself to pork chops. Beside her, Marlene struck a conversation with her brother.Time passed quickly after she finished her meal, and before she knew it, Dumbledore had stood up."An excellent feast, if I may so myself! Especially when one considers the day you will be having tomorrow," he said jovially. "You have a full day of magical studies starting in the morning, and I believe it best to retire for the night. Off to bed with you all, toodle-oo!"Lily stood up as the Great Hall was filled with the buzz of conversation and the sound of scraping as the weight of the students was lifted off of the wooden benches. She heard Remus and the other prefects calling to the first–years when she was tapped on the shoulder by James."Ready?" he asked. He sounded tired and sleepy."Yes, let's go."It took them a couple of minutes to get to the Headmaster's quarters. James gave the password to the stone gargoyles (Lifesaver), who jumped aside and let them enter. They ascended the steps and soon found themselves face to face with Dumbledore's wooden door. It was James who knocked on it."Come in," said Dumbledore from behind the door. James pushed it open.Lily had only been in the Headmaster's office a handful of times, none of them for trouble or detention. Yet, it never failed to impress her: there was an aura of magnificence and grandeur about it unlike any other room in the castle, but there was also the sense of timeless knowledge and ancient wisdom lurking beneath. Paintings of previous headmasters decorated the stone walls, all of whom appeared to be sleeping. Shelves and racks filled with timeworn books stood side by side around the room.All across the floor, tables displaying various silver instruments were shrouded in half-darkness, and a swirling Pensieve was visible behind the doors of a cabinet. The headmaster himself was seated behind a large marble table on top of a small dais. A large, red–and–gold bird stood on its perch beside Dumbledore. A phoenix, remembered Lily, whom she knew was called Fawkes."Ah, James, Lily, welcome. Take a seat, please," he greeted them, and gestured towards two large squishy chairs in front of his desk. Lily took a seat on the right."I trust the train ride was uneventful?" asked Dumbledore, merely to start the conversation. James and Lily both nodded."Excellent, then. Now, I only wanted to discuss your job descriptions, so stop looking so apprehensive, James," said Dumbledore, and twinkled at the Head Boy, who visibly relaxed. "As Heads, you two have unparalleled authority over the student body, save for the teachers and myself, of course. Both of you will handle most of the events that take place during the school year, including the Gathering of Many Faces, which falls on Halloween."Dumbledore leaned forwards on his table, studying James and Lily. It was a moment before he spoke again."I also wanted to dispel any doubt left in both of your minds," said Dumbledore quietly, looking at James, "I believe I have chosen well. I seem to remember that you have gotten over your differences, so I applaud you for that; I know that Hogwarts will thrive. James, you have matured quite well ever since your last – er, shall I say, fiasco – and I expect you to set an example for the student body." Dumbledore turned his gaze on Lily, and his blue eyes surveyed her magisterially over the top of his half-moon spectacles, "You both have to work together, and hopefully get to know each other a bit more, seeing as you are now sharing living quarters."The silence that followed was so thick Lily was certain she could have cut it with a well placed Diffindo. Lily spoke first, her voice a little dry."I'm sorry, Professor, but did I hear you right? Living quarters?""Oh yes, Lily, you certainly heard me right," said Professor Dumbledore, now quite cheerfully, "as Heads, you have access to your own tower. Inside it is a common room, two separate beds and two separate bathrooms. I think I am correct in saying that you know where this tower lies, James?"James smiled sheepishly. "You're correct in believing that, Professor." Dumbledore nodded approvingly."Oh, and one more thing," added Dumbledore, his voice now serious. "There have been recent events in the world that have given me no choice but to reinforce the rules around Hogwarts. And while Hogwarts is, and will always be, the safest place for you should violence arise, one can never be too at ease. The enemy is rising, and tension in the school has never been higher." He paused, and to Lily, he appeared to be choosing his words."I cannot change the mind of others, so believe me when I say that both of you will encounter hate and prejudice in all parts of the castle, some parts more prominent than others," he regarded them both, and there was a slight tinge of disappointment in his eyes, "I will not tolerate bigotry in my school. As heads, however, it is imperative that both of you keep order and not let your emotions rule you. To outsiders of Hogwarts, the two of you are the face of the student body.""We understand, Professor," said Lily, "but is it really as extreme as you say, sir? Has he started recruiting here? Has You-Know-Who's influence reached Hogwarts at last?"Dumbledore smiled sadly."It has for a long time, my dear girl," sighed Dumbledore, "Voldemort has poisoned the minds of many in Hogwarts. It is foolish not to take precautions. It is also silly," he added with a glance at Lily, who had twitched at the mention of Voldemort, "to be afraid to say a name. Voldemort is a great wizard, yes, but he is a man. A name should not be feared."James suddenly gave a great yawn. He closed his mouth quickly, but it had not gone unnoticed by either Dumbledore or Lily."Merlin's beard, look at the time! I'm sorry to have kept you so long here," said Dumbledore apologetically, as James rushed to apologize, seeing as it was only 9 o'clock, "no, no, it's my fault. Off to bed with you two. Your trunks and belongings have been taken to your tower. James, seeing as you already know of its location, kindly show Lily where it is," Dumbledore looked at Lily with a slight smile playing on his mouth, "It is a rather extraordinary place, Miss Evans, and I'm sure the both of you will be happy with it."Realizing they were being dismissed, Lily and James both turned around, exited the room and descended the stone steps until they reached the floor."So James," said Lily casually, "where is this rather extraordinary tower?"James smiled mysteriously. "Oh, a place called Neverland."Lily raised her eyebrows at him."I'm kidding," he said hastily, "it's near the Gryffindor tower, actually. Smaller, of course, but it's only for two people. Shall we go?"Lily hadn't meant anything by raising her eyebrows; she had been impressed by the fact that he even knew what Neverland was. It had never occurred to her how James might have ever read a muggle book."Er, Lily?"She realized that James was still waiting for her answer."I can tell you the directions, of course, if you'd rather not go with me –""No!" interjected Lily quickly, "No, I mean, I'd rather go with you, thanks."James nodded and they started walking towards the direction of Gryffindor tower.Lily then voiced her earlier thoughts at him, and he laughed a bit before replying, "Yeah, my mum read Peter and Wendy to me a lot when I was a kid. Neverland just sounded so cool, you know, it sort of stuck. I've always wanted to visit Neverland."They laughed together, and it surprised Lily how easy it was to talk to him. She and James had become good friends over the past year, but she'd never found anything to relate to with James. Now, they were bonding over their shared love over Peter Pan."Well, here we are."They stopped in front of a painting of a pair of wizards with their backs to them striking down a gryphon with their wands. It was a rather messy painting, Lily noted, but then again she never had had an eye for artwork."So how do we get in?" asked Lily to James. He shrugged, and then addressed the painting."Hullo, I'm James Potter and this is Lily Evans. We're the new Head Boy and Girl of the school. Er, we were told that the Head's Tower was here?"For a moment, Lily wanted to scold James, that he was being stupid, that that was just a painting, and paintings couldn't talk, silly, before she suddenly remembered where she was, and both wizards turned around and waved at him."Hello!" said the one on the right, wearing emerald green robes. "Professor Dumbledore did mention, hm –" he quickly took in James's messy hair and black glasses then glanced at Lily and eyed her dark red locks, before his eyes wandered off to their chests as their badges shined proudly at him. "All right, James Potter and Lily Evans. You'll need to suggest a password before entering.""Might I suggest a good password, as the head before you, Frank Longbottom, had set it as Flobberworm," quipped in the wizard on the left, who was wearing brown robes.James and Lily looked at each other. James spoke first, "Well?"Lily shrugged. "You can set it as anything you want, I really don't care."James sighed."Blimey, I hate deciding for other people," he mumbled. "How about... Neverland?"Both of the wizards in the painting slapped their painted hands onto their painted faces. Even Lily looked at James incredulously, with a look that spelled, Really?"What?" asked James defensively, "I told you, I'm not good at deciding this trivial stuff. You can set it if you want.""No, no, Neverland's fine, it just sort of contradicts what the wizards were saying, don't you think?" Lily turned back to the wizards, who then looked at each other, and swung open to reveal a wooden path that led to a fairly large common room. There were a handful of couches arranged into a square of sorts, with a wooden table at its centre. A fireplace crackled in nearby and bookshelves filled with old tomes lined the walls of the room.To the north of the common room, behind the couches, two sets of stairs spiralled upwards towards – undoubtedly – their respective rooms. She stepped through the painting and it swung shut behind her and James.She made for her dorm on the left side. It looked very much like the girls' dormitories back in Gryffindor Tower, with red-and-gold curtains hanging down her windows and her four-poster bed. There was a table and chair to the corner of her room that she was sure to be grateful for as NEWTs approached.Lily wasted no time in going to bed; she changed into her pyjamas and brushed her teeth. She wondered briefly what James's room looked like, and, deciding that that could wait for tomorrow, she settled into her bed.

Chapter Five: Plant the TruthJames awoke from his slumber half-expecting Sirius to be looking down upon him and grinning like a fool.It was very odd. He'd gotten so used to the sound of Sirius's snores that waking up without them was… well, odd. Even during the summers, when they'd both stay up late and sleep in till noon, Sirius's snoring was unbelievable.He sighed and rose on his bed. He was in the Head's Tower, he remembered now. There would be no Sirius to wake him up.James showered and dressed. His new room was nearly an exact replica of the boys' dormitories back in Gryffindor Tower, except that it was slightly smaller. All this space, just for one person. Swinging his schoolbag over his shoulder, he exited the dorm. He eyed Lily's door for a moment, and he considered waking her up.Smiling at the thought of what she'd do to him if he barged into her room mid-sleep, James forced himself down to Gryffindor Tower. He'd never admit it to them, but he missed the Marauders terribly already.He rounded a corner and found himself face to face with the Fat Lady. She looked down at him impassively."Password?"James scratched his nose. "Er… Fovea leonum, wasn't it?""Correct," said the Fat Lady airily, and she swung open like a door, revealing a large, circular hole in the wall through which James climbed.The Gryffindor common room was bustling about with students all hurrying to get down to breakfast. James pulled himself out of the way and ascended the stairs that led up to his former dorm.He pushed the door open and was immediately blinded by a flash of white light. He shielded his eyes; he felt something large and fuzzy engulf his body as excited shouts and muffled laughs filled his ears. James, surprised, tried to fight it off, but the blanket stuck to him like a bowtruckle to a tree."I reckon that's a bit too much, don't you think?" said a weary voice."Nah, he's all right," said another, this one closest to James."Do the water thing!" exclaimed someone else; his voice was high and squeaky."No, that's enough, you two," said the first voice sternly. "Sirius, let him go."He felt the blanket fall; he blinked, trying to adjust to the sudden brightness."Prongs!" Sirius launched forwards and wrapped him in a hug. "I missed you, you prat!""Gerroffme," muttered James, shaking himself so that Sirius would let go. "What in Merlin's name were you doing?"Sirius let go and James stepped back, still blinking, and his friends came into focus. There was Peter, beaming excitedly, and Remus, who was looking taller than ever, and then Sirius, who had on a mischievous look about his face. James smoothed down his robes and straightened his glasses."Sorry, Prongs," said Remus sheepishly. "I tried to stop them.""How'd you know I was coming, anyway?" asked James.In answer, Remus held up a large collage of parchment with various moving dots with words too small for James to see – The Marauder's Map, of course. James groaned inwardly as he thought that he'd be seeing much less of it, now that he was living in a different part of the castle."Breakfast, then?" asked Remus, "I'm starving."Ten minutes later, the Marauders marched into the Great Hall. They seated themselves on the benches and started filling their plates; James helped himself to a few slices of toast and some eggs.Before he could take a bite, three girls entered the Great Hall, and one called out his name. "Oi, Potter!"James looked at his food sadly and turned around to meet Marlene. "Yeah?"She slid onto the bench next to him before answering, by which time James had finally eaten. "Listen – when're you holding trials?"It took a moment before James could figure out what she meant. "Oh – Quidditch? I… er, actually haven't thought about it."Marlene the Seeker made a tut-tutting sound. "Well, decide quickly then, because somehow I ended up with this list –" and she thrust a long piece of parchment under his nose with names that he did not recognize "– McGonagall reckons that there are thirty new people waiting."James took the list and scanned it quickly. Blimey, he thought, there were tons of people trying out. Usually, there would be no more than 10 or 15. He turned back to Marlene."Today's Friday, isn't it?""Yep," she said, spreading marmalade over her toast.James glanced at the list. "I'll hold trials on Sunday, then.""Right," she took a bite out of her toast. "What do we need, anyway? A new chaser, a beater –?""– And a keeper," finished James. "Frank Longbottom is irreplaceable, but I suppose new blood won't hurt.""I heard Harley Johnson's a good chaser," offered Marlene.James finished his eggs and continued to his toast. "Johnson – that fourth year?"They continued their talk about Quidditch until the owls came soaring in through the upper windows. Screeching and hooting, they descended all over the Hall, carrying letters and packages. Morgoth was nowhere to be seen, but a large tawny owl landed in front of him, bringing James the latest edition of the Daily Prophet. He placed a knut into its outstretched talon. The owl hooted once and took off, taking a slice of Sirius's bacon in the process."Why is it always me?" muttered Sirius. James sniggered. The sound of his laugh made him turn to James, a surprised look in his face."Oh yeah, which reminds me – your present!"James stopped laughing. "Come again?"Sirius plunged his hands into the insides of his robes, apparently searching for something. "Your start-of-term present, I totally forgot about it!""Sirius, I was joking. You don't have to –"But Sirius then extracted a small bag from under his blazer, a triumphant look in his face. James eyed him confusedly. "A mokeskin pouch?"Sirius rolled his eyes. "No, you prat, it's – oh, just wait a moment."Sirius shook the pouch, and James was surprised to hear a rattling sound, coming from something much bigger than what you could store in a small purse. Sirius put a hand inside it and felt around; it reached all the way to his shoulder, and to James it looked as though something was eating his arm.Remus laughed at the sight of him. "You look ridiculous, Padfoot."Sirius shot him a frown, but then his face morphed into a gleeful expression and he pulled his arm slowly from the pouch. James held his breath; what was he going to give him? He'd only gotten Sirius a single jelly bean!Sirius extracted something long and polished. James's insides squirmed and flipped. Marlene turned her head to watch."Here we are!"It was beautiful, thought James as he took it from Sirius, his hands shaking slightly. Its dark mahogany handle had the words Nimbus: One inscribed on its side. Its hazel twigs glinted brightly in the sun. The metal braces circling around the mid-handle were cool to the touch, and to James it looked suspiciously like –"Goblin-wrought iron, that," said Sirius, pleased with James's reaction. "First of its kind. That thing's got about as much protection as a knight in full armour.""How did you get the money for this, Sirius?" asked James disbelievingly."Oh, I didn't get it," laughed Sirius. "It was your dad, Prongs, I only pitched in a galleon."James frowned. "Somehow I don't feel that bad about not getting you a decent present anymore."He pushed his plate and glass aside and placed the broomstick on the breakfast table. Marlene was examining it carefully, and even Alice and Lily were eyeing it with interest.At that moment, Professor McGonagall walked up to their little group, carrying a handful of laminated papers. She did a double-take once she saw James's broom, and, after giving them the timetables, she congratulated him and offered to take the broom to the broomshed.James accepted the offer, thinking that that would prevent him from distracting himself. As McGonagall walked away, carrying his broom, he grabbed his copy of the Daily Prophet and skimmed through it."Anything interesting?" asked Peter."Nothing," said James, frowning slightly. "You'd think, that with all this Voldemort business going on, the Prophet would be reporting something worthwhile –""Oh, cheer up, you," said Lily playfully, who had moved from her seat and was now standing behind him and Sirius, "don't be so damned depressing.""I'm only being realistic, Lily," he said reprovingly."Can't you just be happy that for once, there isn't something about Death Eaters in the news –""Well, we can't ignore every problem, can we, Miss Ignoramus –""Oh, stop arguing, you two," said Sirius, for Lily had opened her mouth to retort. "Let's just forget it, yeah?"Lily sighed, but shrugged all the same. "Shall we go to Potions, then?"James glanced at the staff table. Professor McGonagall was already there, looking disgruntled. She and Dumbledore and Professor Flitwick looked to be in deep conversation, all sporting the same, grave look. James wondered what that was about.He glanced at his newspaper. James had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on.A large, metallic bell rang, and the Gryffindors went down to the dungeons to begin their potions lesson. Inside, Professor Slughorn was already writing on the blackboard."Good morning, Professor," said Lily as she and the rest of the Gryffindors found a table together near the front."Hello, my dear Lily," said Slughorn distractedly, "had a good summer, I trust?""Oh yes, sir," nodded Lily earnestly.Giving them all one last smile, Slughorn went to the blackboard, where he welcomed the N.E.W.T students warmly."Good morning, all," said Slughorn, "I'm sure you're going to be hearing a lot about how important your N.E.W.T tests will be, so I'm not going to bother. We have a tricky potion ahead of us, a potion that will take the better part of a month to mature, one that is essential to Auror work should any of you consider it a path. I am, of course, talking about Veritaserum, a potion I am sure you are all familiar with. Now, who can tell me about its effects – yes, Lily?"James was struck around his glasses as Lily shot her hand up. She whispered a quick "Sorry!" to him, and James smiled amusedly as he listened to her, "Veritaserum is, to put it simply, the world's most powerful truth serum. Colourless and odourless, it's near impossible to distinguish from water, except for the way it ripples near the bottom of its container."Slughorn smiled genuinely. "Excellent Lily, take 5 points to Gryffindor. Now, can anyone tell me why, since Veritaserum is acknowledged as the most powerful truth potion in the world, it is considered unethical and unreliable to use? Mainly... during Ministry trials? Court? Can anyone tell me why Ministry officials don't just force suspected criminals into drinking Veritaserum?"Lily did not raise her hand this time, nor did anyone else in the class. James, however, was thinking hard and fast. He thought his answer through, and, deciding that it didn't sound like complete rubbish, raised his hand."No one?" asked Slughorn, a bit disappointed, "Well, then – oh, yes, go on, Mr Potter.""While Veritaserum's effects aren't doubted by anybody," began James, and though he did not know it, Lily was eyeing him appreciatively, "the actual truth, when taken from a person, is complicated. Someone who's being interrogated will just tell them what they believe is the truth. Which isn't necessarily the, er... actual truth. Moreover, Veritaserum's effects can be countered by drinking its antidote beforehand, or by using Occlumency. Some witches and wizards have also been shown to have enough tolerance against it.""Fantastic, Mr Potter, very good," Slughorn nodded approvingly, "5 points to Gryffindor. The truth, as Mr Potter has put it, is complicated. Veritaserum is not the most reliable of potions, and I myself have found to be quite resistant to its effects. But that is enough trivia, now..."Slughorn waved his wand, and the cupboard swung open. A bunch of ingredients flew out slowly and divided equally into the tables occupied by the N.E.W.T students. "Take out your cauldron and tools, as well as your copies of Very Advanced Potionmaking, and turn to page twelve. The ingredients I have provided are more than enough for ten students in one table. You will find the instructions in the book, as well as some tips and guidance on the blackboard, should you encounter any trouble. You may begin."James did as Slughorn had told them to, and had already filled his cauldron with alcohol and water from their ingredients. He perused his book as he worked, and once or twice glanced at the blackboard for tips, which included a revised amount of powdered moonstone (4 spoonfuls, not 3, as well as other similar advice) and by the end of the class he had achieved the exact 'light shade of blue, akin to the sky' as the book had described. Slughorn walked around, examining their potions, and had said an 'excellent, Mr/Ms' to only a handful of students: James, Lily, and Snape."Well done, to all of you!" said Slughorn, though he eyed Peter and Marlene, whose potions had somehow taken on the texture of wet cement. "That was a very acceptable first attempt at Veritaserum. Leave your cauldrons here, under the shade –" he indicated towards a large empty bookcase behind his desk, "– I shall tend to them. Homework: a foot and a half of the uses of Veritaserum, as well as theories as to how it could be utilized more effectively. Dismissed!"James, Sirius, and Marlene all had a free double period after potions, while the rest of the 7th year Gryffindors went off to either Ancient Runes or Divination. They spent the hour and a half playing Exploding Snap with the 6th years before the bell rang and he went off to Transfiguration, where all 7th year Gryffindors were present.Professor McGonagall had, unfortunately, reminded them about the importance of the upcoming tests. James and Sirius glanced at each other and shared a quiet smile as McGonagall spoke. Once she'd finished, she had set them to transfiguring live rabbits into objects of much bigger size – namely, desks, bed frames, and drawers. James and Sirius found no trouble with this, and they were the first ones to transform their identical rabbits into a single bunk bed by stacking them on top of each other. Professor McGonagall had reluctantly awarded them both 10 points.The rest of the day passed quickly in James's opinion. He didn't even remember having lunch. He and Lily faced their first challenge as Heads when they found a couple of second-year Hufflepuffs playing hooky in an unused classroom."... and don't ever let us catch you skipping class ever again!" bellowed Lily after the retreating backs of the small Hufflepuffs. James laughed."Well done, Lils, I think you've scared them into next year," snorted James, earning him a light slap on his shoulder."I wasn't that mean, was I?" asked Lily, frowning slightly."No, you were fine," said James sarcastically, earning him another slap and a hair ruffle.That evening found James lounging on one of the couches in the Heads' common room with the rest of the Marauders around the table, working on their potions essays. Actually, thought James, as he glanced around at his friends, it was only Sirius who was working, as he and Remus had already finished it, and Peter had ultimately given up.He listened to the sweet sound of a frustrated, curse-spouting Sirius as he begged the both of them to hand him their essays. Remus had adamantly refused, saying that copying off of each other would lead to bad habits."Oh, come on! A little peek! You know you want to, Prongs!"James laughed. "No, I don't think I do, thanks," he said, and then took out the Marauders Map from inside his robes."What I don't understand, Padfoot," said Remus, raising an eyebrow at Sirius, "is how you could brew the Animagus potion, one of the hardest potions to make, but then struggle with Veritaserum."Sirius scoffed. "Animagi are actually interesting, Moony, whereas Veritaserum is a bunch of rubbish. You really think that I'm gonna be on the receiving end of a truth potion? I'm not going to become some criminal."Remus rolled his eyes. "If you'd heard Slughorn at all, you'd know that criminals don't usually get a dose of Veritaserum, Padfoot."Sirius gave a cry of frustration. "Come on, just tell me what the sodding answers are, I want to look at the map-""You'll get a look when you've finished your essay," said Remus pointedly, who had shoved James's head out of the way as he sat down next to him and browsed the map too."Besides, Padfoot, you've seen the map dozens of times, what makes you think this time will be any different?" said Peter, who had moved to behind their sofa.Sirius opened his mouth, then closed it, then opened it again, "Well, it took us a long time to make it! Besides, it was my idea. I'm the rightful owner of the map."At this, the others exploded into protests as they reminded Sirius, yet again, that it had been a joint project, that it had required some of the most complex magic that any of them had ever cast and that it wouldn't have been finished without all four of them working together.Well, thought James privately, it had mostly been me, Padfoot and Moony. Wormtail just sat around acting like moral support… "Methinks I'm still the rightful owner," said Sirius reproachfully.James rolled his eyes. "Just get back to your essay, Pads. And the rest of you lot better keep quiet, Lily's about to enter."A few moments after he had said that, the painting swung open to reveal the Head Girl, looking content and sleepy."Hi," the four boys greeted her automatically."Hey," greeted Lily back, slightly overwhelmed by the presence of them all. "Working on an essay, Black? I thought Remus was the studious one."Sirius shot a scathing look at Lily, who laughed heartily. She then climbed the stairs and was about to enter her room before she turned back to James."Don't stay up too late, all right James?" she said, and James instantly turned his head towards her. " Professor Dumbledore wants to meet with us tomorrow in the morning.""Again?" replied James, checking his watch and seeing that it was already 10 o'clock. "I won't stay up late, then. Are you going to sleep?""I am, yeah," replied Lily."Good night, then.""'Night, James, and you lot as well, I suppose," and she shut the door behind her.James glanced around at his friends, who were keeping rather straight faces. "What?""Nothing!" said Remus, though he did try to hide a smile behind his hand. "So, any success yet, James?""What are you talking about?""Never mind," interrupted Peter quickly. "You know, it is getting rather late for a school night. Maybe we should go back to the tower."Sirius scoffed. "It's only a date with Albus, Prongs is fine with us staying, right?"James rolled his eyes at him, "I'm not actually, Padfoot. I'm feeling rather tired myself." James yawned wide, then spoke to Remus, "When's the next full moon? I'm itching to stretch my legs a bit."Remus pondered for a bit, "Let me think – oh yeah, there's one on the 28th, about four weeks from now.""Good, that's something to look forward to, then.""For you, maybe," said Remus darkly, "me, on the other hand...""Ah, cheer up, Moons," said Sirius, abandoning his essay and placing his head on James's knee, "you'll have us to keep you company."The four of them spent a few more minutes enjoying each other's company, talking, joking, when they all collectively yawned, and they decided that the night was getting fairly old.Lily rapped her knuckles smartly on the surface of James's door. "James!"There was no sound. She envied him for his ability to sleep soundly.Lily sighed. If he didn't wake up soon, they'd be late. Professor Dumbledore had insisted on meeting them both at 7 in the morning, and while she'd agreed like a sheep yesterday she was starting to think that maybe she ought to have negotiated a bit more.Lily raised her hand, pounding the door again. "James, come on! We're going to be late!"When the door didn't open, Lily closed her eyes and prayed to Merlin; she took out her wand."Don't say I didn't warn you, James! Alohomora!"The handle turned with a click. She barged in, peeking between her fingers, and she found James's figure covered head to toe in his blanket, like a corpse in a coffin. He was still fast asleep."JAMES!"The Head Boy thrashed and gave a sort of strangled yell. Two long sticks popped out from where his head should have been, but before Lily could get a closer look, they vanished just as quickly and James flipped over to see who had woken him up.Lily and James stared at each other for a moment – he was clad only in his briefs, which might have added to the awkwardness, and then Lily gave a muffled apology and bolted out of the room, slamming the door behind her.She leaned against the railing. Her heart was beating so quickly she was sure it would jump out and scold her for being so stupid. A near-naked James Potter was not something she was ready to see in the early hours of the morning.Lily glanced at her watch and her stupid heart skipped a beat: it was 6:54. Dumbledore's office was miles away from the Head's tower.She looked at James's door, resigning herself to enter again if he didn't come out in the next ten seconds. She counted slowly, tapping her fingers against her robes, and once she'd reached twelve she marched to his door and was about to start assaulting it when it opened, revealing the messy-haired, bespectacled James Potter.James grinned at her. There was a bit of sleep in his eyes that he hadn't rubbed away. "Shall we go, then?""You've just made us late!" seethed Lily, ignoring him. "Come on, you prat!"She grabbed his arm and marched towards the painting of the two wizards; it swung open and they both climbed through, Lily dragging James in the direction of Dumbledore's office."Lily –""No talking until we get there, James.""But –""We're already late, James! We have to hurry!""Lily." James gently tugged his hand out of hers. She hadn't even realized she was still holding it. "Just stop for a minute, all right?"Lily stood, her arms crossed and eyeing him impatiently. James bent down, tying his shoes while whistling absently."Are you done?" she asked haughtily. James glanced at her and smirked.He stood up, and Lily noticed how much taller he was than her – at least a head in difference.Ignoring her butterflies, Lily turned on her heel. "Come on, then."This time, James grabbed her hand, sending goosebumps all the way up to her elbow. "Just calm down, will you? We're not going to be late."James let go and turned to the wall. They were still on the same floor, and Dumbledore's office was two floors below. James tapped a brick with his wand – it giggled, as though he'd tickled it – it shook slightly, and it fell away, making a hole – the hole grew wider and wider until it formed a passage large enough to fit a small troll. It was dimly lit, though by what she couldn't see."Come on, then," teased James in a voice several octaves higher, and Lily, who'd been standing there with her mouth slightly open, slapped his shoulder and followed James through the hole."Where does this go?" asked Lily. James glanced back."Straight to that corridor. You know, the one behind Zamira the Zealous's portrait?"She racked her brains as she tried to remember where Zamira the Zealous's painting was. "But… isn't that on the second floor? We're on the fourth, how on Earth –?""It's best not to question it, Lily," said James. They continued to walk through the passage for a few seconds, until at last James held up his wand and tapped the wall to their left."Here we are," he said triumphantly.They rounded a corner and said hi to Zamira, who was too busy sleeping to notice them. Soon, they found themselves just outside of the stone gargoyle guarding Dumbledore's office.Lily looked at her watch. "A minute left to spare. Shall we go up?"They said the password to the gargoyle and climbed the spiralling stairs of Dumbledore's chambers. They came face-to-face with the brass door, and Lily knocked on it lightly."Come in," said a weary, tired voice.They pushed open the door and found Dumbledore seated behind his desk, a grey look on his face.This can't be good, thought Lily. She and James took their usual seats and waited.Dumbledore looked at them both sadly. "Lord Voldemort has attacked."Her stomach dropped. She had not been expecting that. Praying that Voldemort didn't know where Cokeworth was, she forced herself to speak. "Where, Professor?"The Headmaster tapped something with his wand, and one of his many silver instruments whirred to life; it spewed green smoke that rippled and shimmered and formed into an image. It had been taken from high up, yet Lily couldn't help the slight gasp that slipped through her mouth as she realized what it was."The Hogwarts Express?" whispered James, looking horrified.The Hogwarts Express had fallen on its side as though a giant had knocked it over. It reminded Lily unpleasantly of the train toys she used to play with as a child. Nearly all of the carriages had been damaged to an extent – melted and peppered with holes and looking as though a huge sword had run it through."Indeed," said Dumbledore grimly. "It appears that Voldemort attacked it after it had departed for London; the only person on the train was Theodore Plant."She didn't recognize the name. James, however, sat up straighter, a startled frown on his face."Theodore Plant?" he asked. "The conductor? Why would Voldemort want anything to do with him?"Dumbledore gave them both a grave look. "The Ministry is working to find that out as we speak, I assure you. Theodore Plant was a great friend of Professor Slughorn. He was a good man.""Was?" said Lily. "But, Professor – you make it sound like he's already –""There were signs of struggle and bloodshed in the train," said Dumbledore. "His body has not yet been recovered. Minister Minchum has pronounced him dead – until proven otherwise."Dumbledore sighed, and for a moment it struck Lily just how old he looked – ancient and worn."So much has happened, so early on in the year," he said sadly. "It did not occur to me that he would try to attack the train; Hogwarts, yes, but not the train.""Professor – you said that the train was empty except for Plant," said James, "Why would he attack when no one was on board?""I believe he merely wanted to frighten people," answered Dumbledore, "Anxious parents will read the news this morning and fear for their children's safety. An aura of terror has seeped into the wizarding community, which is what I am sure he was after. So far, Voldemort is winning."Dumbledore leaned forwards and slashed his wand through the smoke-image; it dissipated and faded into the air."Once this morning's edition of the Daily Prophet reaches Hogwarts, Voldemort's sympathisers – if they do not already know – will try and take it upon themselves to continue his work. I will not have that in my school."The Headmaster regarded them both with his piercing blue eyes. "I must ask you to be on your guard, for they will try to attack any person in a position of authority. I must also request that you start your patrols next week; that way, we will ensure that no one is out wandering at night."Fawkes whistled a low, gloomy tune. Dumbledore smiled bitterly."I'm sorry to have put so much pressure on your shoulders, the both of you," he murmured."That's all right, Professor," said James hurriedly, "We understand."The Headmaster leaned back in his chair and bid them goodbye. Right then, Lily saw a different man – he was still Dumbledore, but not the Dumbledore she had known for so long. He looked vulnerable and worried, human – not at all like an all-powerful wizard capable of solving their problems.She felt her chest heave and breath shorten as scenarios filled her head. She didn't even say goodbye to James as she headed back to her room. At the moment, Lily desired only peace and quiet.Tears silently dripped down onto her lap as she sat on her bed. She wiped her eyes furiously. Lily knew that someone would come in looking for her later, but she didn't care.Voldemort was a monster, she decided. A heartless, cruel monster that could not be reasoned with, that would always be hunting down those with dirty blood, like her; that would always be lusting for power, never satisfied with what he had; that would be forever cursed to scorch Britain with his Dark Mark."Hogwarts Express crash," read Remus aloud an hour later, "Theodore Plant, conductor of Hogwarts Express, presumed dead at 87."The Marauders sat in silence at the breakfast table. James's paper had been brought by the regular post owl, and he'd informed his friends of what Dumbledore had told him."Death Eaters were involved in the derailment and destruction of the train tracks, which caused Theodore Plant, conductor of the Hogwarts express, to veer off course," continued Remus. "His body has not been recovered. The train had been making its return journey to London, and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named himself was said to have appeared personally.""This says it happened near Dundee," said Peter, reading over Remus's shoulder. "Blimey, it couldn't have been an hour after we'd gotten off."James glanced up at the staff table. Dumbledore was nowhere to be found, nor was McGonagall. He spotted Slughorn looking very miserable as he stirred his morning pumpkin juice with his fork. He remembered what Dumbledore had told him and Lily – that Theodore Plant had been a good friend of Slughorn's.James pushed his breakfast away. He wasn't feeling very hungry. After their meeting with Dumbledore, Lily had gone straight to the Head's Tower and locked herself in her dorm. He had not seen her since."Bloody fucking hell," said Sirius. "It never stops, does it?"They remained silent, watching the rest of the Hall gossip and discuss Quidditch and other pointless bollocks. Very few of them took the paper every day like James did."My family did this," muttered Sirius solemnly. "My blood.""No," said James instantly, holding Sirius's gaze, "Sirius, no – they're not your family. You're a Potter now. You're a part of my family.""My blood," repeated Sirius, "it was my blood…""Since when have you cared about your blood?" snapped James, suddenly aggressive. "Blood means nothing!"Sirius stared back at him, his eyes looking like broken glass. "That summer, before I left the house – I heard Regulus and my parents talking. He said he wanted to be like Bellatrix, follow in her footsteps, cleanse the world of tainted-blood… If I hadn't left, maybe I could've stopped him, changed his mind.""You can't blame yourself, Sirius," said Remus gently. "It's not your fault. Regulus chose his own path."James suddenly understood why Sirius was suddenly feeling this way. He looked at the Slytherin table. It was a different story there: the older students were gathered around in one bench, listening to Avery and Mulciber recount a story. They laughed loudly, and he saw Avery holding the Prophet, pointing to it now and then.A fist closed around James's heart. He suddenly felt violent; he wanted to duel Avery and Mulciber right then and there –No, he whispered to himself. Stop that."I can't stand it," said Sirius. "Not being able to do anything… it's unbearable. We have to do something about this."James privately agreed. They left the Great Hall shortly after that, each going in their own separate ways. He dragged his feet over to the painting of the two wizards."Neverland," he said mutely, and the wizards bowed to him and swung open. He was about to head for his dorm when, suddenly, as if his head had a will of its own, he looked up at Lily's room. The door was slightly ajar, and he had the intense desire to see her.Figuring that it wouldn't hurt to check on her, he climbed the stairs leading to Lily's room and knocked on the door."Come in," said a quiet voice. James pushed the door open.He found Lily sprawled on her bed, her hair a tangled mess and her clothes rumpled and mismatched. Her eyes were slightly red. She had a blank look about her face, but to James, she looked as beautiful as ever."Hey, James," she murmured. "Did you need anything?"James smiled wryly. "Actually, I was going to ask you the same thing." He sat down on the floor opposite her bed. "Is everything all right?"She sighed and rolled over so that he was facing her back now. "Everything's fine, James."James counted the number of flowers that were patterned onto her clothes. "No," he decided. "Everything's not fine."Lily snorted in spite of herself. "Congratulations, Sherlock.""Lily," he said softly, "Everyone needs to let out once in a while. Nobody can be strong all the time."She remained silent. James got up, tucking his hands in his pockets, and turned to leave."I'm here for you, all right?" said James, putting a foot out of her door. "If you need to talk – well, you know where to find me."He made to close the door, but then –"James."He glanced back and saw that she was sitting up, looking down at her mattress.He entered the room once more and left the door slightly open. "Yes?"Lily pulled her knees up to her chest. "I – I don't think I'm ready to talk. It's just… I don't want to be alone. Can you stay here with me?""'Course I can. As long as you need."James sat on the edge of her bed, leaning against one of her bedposts. They remained silent, Lily staring blankly at the floor and James watching her. It was awkward at first, he noticed, but they were making progress.Slowly, Lily began to talk to him. He didn't think she even noticed what she was doing; she'd spoken suddenly, but James listened to her.She told him about how she was worried about her family. The news of Voldemort's attack had reminded her that no one was safe, not even a sweet old conductor like Theodore Plant. She spoke about how she was afraid that her being Head Girl would put her family in danger, and that she was seriously considering resigning her post."No," said James firmly. "You earned this, you can't let some people bully you out of it."Then, she began to open up about how she was worried that she wouldn't survive after school, that Death Eaters would be waiting for her every step of the way. She also told him about how she couldn't go back to the muggle world, that she was much too attached to magic to give it up, and besides; she had nothing – no one to go back to.James was a good listener.And, after she'd finished, James began to tell her about how he was worried for his friends. Not for himself, but for his friends. He told her how he wasn't sure that Sirius would be able to cope with not having something like school to distract him. He told her how he was afraid Remus would get depressed, that he wouldn't be able to find work (she knew about his condition, Remus had told him) all because he was a werewolf.And when they'd finally exhausted their topics, they began to tell stories of their life in and outside Hogwarts. Lily told him how she and Petunia would always fight over the silliest things – all the way up until she'd met Snape, and she found that she was a witch. She recalled her summers in Spinner's End, practising her magic.James, in turn, recounted how he'd spent every summer after Hogwarts talking to Sirius, begging his parents to let him come over so that he wouldn't stay in that house any longer than he had to. He told her how he'd run away the previous summer, and how he'd begun living with him. That was news to her. She'd never known.Time passed quickly as she talked with James. After one particularly funny story about how she and Marlene had once made Alice's hair glow blue while she was talking to Frank Longbottom, she crashed on her bed, laughing delightedly."Oh, Merlin," she snorted, "I've never told that to anyone. Not even Alice knows."James smiled, his eyes glowing at the sight of seeing her happy. "Feel better?"Lily sat up on her elbows, facing him. "Yeah, actually. I didn't know I needed that.""That's good."They remained silent, but it was no longer awkward. She wasn't sure at first how she'd feel about telling James of her childhood. She'd never even told Marlene or Alice that much about it.Yet, looking at him, his lopsided glasses and his messy hair, the way he ruffled it unconsciously, Lily had never felt more sure that she'd done the right thing in confiding in him. She felt all warm and fuzzy on the inside."You haven't had breakfast, have you?" said James suddenly, looking at her concernedly. "Aren't you hungry?"Lily glanced down at her stomach. If she was being honest with herself, she was quite hungry, but she didn't want to leave her bed."Not really, no," she lied easily.James rolled his eyes and grabbed her hand. "Come on. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, you can't miss it!""Well, aren't you the expert on health," said Lily amusedly, but allowed James to drag her down to the common room. "Where are we going? Breakfast is over.""To the kitchens, of course," responded James. "There's always food there.""Students can go to the kitchens?""Of course they can't, but when's that ever stopped us?"They exited the tower and walked all the way down to the painting of the pear. Marlene and Alice gave her a thumbs up when they passed them in front of Gryffindor Tower.She and James didn't even notice that their hands were still interlinked.

Chapter Six: The Cat, the Mouse, and the WardrobeSunday was a busy day for James. He and Marlene had called trials, with Sirius as the ref and scribe. If he hadn't known any better, James reckoned that the only reason his best mate was there was to spend time with Marlene. That, and probably the prospect of ordering around the younger kids, too.In the end, after a long try-out that had kept him in the Quidditch pitch for the better part of the morning, he'd chosen three new people that he was satisfied with: 4th-year Harley Johnson, who had passed after outflying all of the competition, 5th-year Alex Carter, a beater who looked weedy but aimed well and packed a ferocious hit, and Charles Bonham, a 6th-year keeper that had blocked 9 out of the 10 quaffles that James had shot at him.He spent the rest of the day working on prefect schedules with Lily and Remus, something that he found very boring indeed. He'd decided that he'd patrol three times a week, on the days that he did not have Quidditch Practice. McGonagall had told James that under no circumstances would he be patrolling alone, so he put Remus's name on two-thirds of his schedule, and Lily on the last third.On Monday, James and the rest of the 7th years greeted their new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor first thing in the morning; she was a witch by the name of Miracula Hedith. She was in her mid-40s, figured James, and was pretty in an old-woman sort of way. She'd set them to researching and studying dragons, their first chapter of the DADA textbook. Sirius got ten points taken off from Gryffindor and a detention when he asked her what sort of dragon she busied herself with at night.Next was potions, and they continued to brew their Veritaserum. James and Sirius found no problem with this at all, and nor did Lily; though of course, she had always been ahead of the class in that particular subject. They spent the period cutting up Sopophorous Beans and shaving off bicorn horns.History of Magic came last, which James had no idea how he'd ended up in. He'd gotten an A in his O.W.L, but apparently Binns was so starved of students he'd even let Peter in, who'd gotten a P. James felt somewhat obligated to go to his class, even if he was totally rubbish at it. One of his favourite (only) memories with the old ghost was of him receiving a Circe chocolate-frog card from him.Tuesday passed much like Monday, and so did the rest of the week, in that it was fairly ordinary. He was panicked slightly at the amount of work that he hadn't finished – he had an Arithmancy equation that he was supposed to be dissecting and explaining, due next Wednesday. Professor Hedith had partnered her students, and set them to draw a full-scale diagram of a dragon, mapping out its weak points (James thought privately that, with Sirius as his partner, he wouldn't get that done anytime soon). He also had a Charms essay on the Protean Charm from Professor Flitwick, so, thought James dejectedly, he knew where he'd be spending the nights at.By mid-September, James and Lily had caught a total of ten students wandering out after-hours. He wondered how many of them were actually planning on shagging, but fortunately none of the couples had progressed that far. They hadn't caught any Slytherins, which James found quite odd, because it contradicted directly with what Professor Dumbledore had said.James had agreed with the Headmaster, of course, in which the wannabe Death Eaters would be trying to take over the school. So far, the Slytherins had been perfectly normal – or, at least, as normal as they usually were. They were still slimy, bigotted pricks, and James and Sirius (and on occasion, Remus) relieved their stress by hexing unsuspecting 7th year Slytherins when Lily wasn't looking.So it was on the evening of Wednesday the 21st that James found himself outside of the Head's Tower, waiting for Lily to get out so that they could begin their patrol. He ruffled his hair nervously – she had that effect on him, he was beginning to realize, but he didn't mind in the slightest.Then the painting of the two wizards swung open, and Lily stepped out. She smiled at James and they walked together.It took them half an hour to scout their floor, and they found nothing. Apparently, the students had caught on that James knew their exact location at all times, so they didn't bother anymore.Tonight, though, was different. That morning, he'd left the Marauder's Map with – well, the Marauders – and he'd forgotten to take it back. James and Lily checked every classroom, every broom closet, but still they found nobody.They rounded a corner and climbed a staircase. James cracked a joke here and there, and Lily laughed quietly beside him. He relaxed visibly as they continued to patrol – he and Lily shared the same somewhat-bawdy sense of humour that he'd gotten from years of talking to Sirius.At that point, they were near the Astronomy Tower. It was one of the most common places in which to enjoy a fun, exciting night, and James and Lily had capitalized on that; most of the unlucky couples had been found there.Suddenly, James held a finger to shush Lily and himself, for he had heard a voice coming from the tower.Two voices. Awfully familiar, as well."I think we've found our first pair of troublemakers," murmured James, and then he grinned wickedly. "I know who they are. Let's blast the door open, should give them a good scare."Lily agreed with a matching smirk.They both crept up the stairs, ascending the tower quietly with their wands out, trying to hold in their sniggers. Finally, they reached the door to the parapet; Lily stepped forwards, and with a wave, shouted, "Bombarda!"The wooden door flew open and was blasted back. James felt sorry for the poor students who'd woken up. His guilt immediately subsided as he saw the two figures yelp, ducking as the door sailed past them."Fucking hell, Prongs," complained Sirius, as he realized who was standing at the door frame, "Can't a bloke get some privacy?""The Astronomy Tower, Padfoot?" James cocked an eyebrow. "You deserved it."Next to Sirius, Marlene was blushing profusely, and wasn't meeting James's or Lily's eyes. They were both fully clothed, noted James with relief, but he noticed that Marlene's blouse was rumpled and Sirius's hair messy. They were apparently having a right good time."Well, what would you have me pick?" demanded Sirius. "McGonagall's office?"Lily snorted. "Frankly, anything but the Astronomy Tower. At least you two had the decency to not rip each other's clothes off."James turned to Marlene, grinning widely. "Marls, sweetheart, just make sure to stay safe, all right? And get your priorities straightened out. If you miss practice because you were shagging this wanker –" James gestured at Sirius, who made noises of protest " – I'm going to have to kick you off the team.""Hey!" said Marlene indignantly. Lily laughed at her best friend."Get out of here, you two," said Lily. "And five points from Gryffindor as well."This time both Marlene and Sirius started complaining, but Lily held up her hand. "No arguing. Get to your dormitories. Marly, we're going to have to talk about this tomorrow."Marlene looked as if smoke was about to come steaming from her ears this time, but she grabbed Sirius's hand and dragged him down the stairs."Way to kill the mood, Prongs!" said Sirius as he disappeared through the doorway.James and Lily laughed again. "No detours, you two!""Well, that was fun," said Lily a few moments later. She pointed her wand at the blasted door and said, "Reparo!" and the door flew back to its hinges."We'd better get back now, we've still got a whole floor to patrol."James sighed. "What's the rush? We can enjoy the view from here. It's only eleven, anyways.""It's nearing twelve, actually," said Lily."Whatever," said James smoothly. "I rounded down."Lily shook her head in exasperation, but she leaned against the tower's railing anyways. James copied her, taking in the view.It was a splendid night. The half-moon appeared behind the mountains that ringed the grounds and illuminated the forest before it. James could see birds and Hippogriffs flying above the Forbidden Forest, gliding in intricate patterns that made him dizzy. Once or twice he saw a pair fly high into the air, then swoop back down and didn't return. It was mating season for them.It was also very quiet. The lake was calm and gave no indication that anybody lived there. The castle grounds were peaceful and tranquil, and the only light coming from it was from Hagrid's Hut."I sometimes forget how beautiful Hogwarts can be," breathed Lily.James glanced at her briefly, then turned back to the view. "Yeah, I guess. We should probably head back now."Lily frowned. "But this whole sightseeing was your idea.""I tend to have many ideas at once, love. I think it's my superior intellect."They bickered all the way down the stairs and continued their patrol. They found no trouble, thankfully, and if Sirius and Marlene were out they didn't spot them.Finally, half an hour later, James and Lily trudged back towards the Head's Tower, slightly exhausted. They said their goodnights to each other, and closed the doors to their rooms.Friday dawned and passed quickly. That morning's Potions class had been uneventful, save for Peter exploding his cauldron and covering him and Remus in its contents, causing the both of them to spend their lunch in the Hospital Wing. The rest of the N.E.W.T students had Transfiguration as their final class of the week, and James welcomed it with open arms.They'd progressed to changing cats and mice into full-size wardrobes now, something that James found quite challenging. Sirius was the first to get it, and it took James a couple more tries until the stubborn cat turned into a simple, wooden closet. They were the only ones to do it, though Marlene and Remus had managed to transfigure their mice into half-rodent, half-furniture hybrids, which McGonagall still gave half a point for.That evening found James in his favourite squishy armchair by the fire, sitting with the Marauders. He relished in the thought that he'd be able to play Quidditch tomorrow without any nagging thoughts in the back of his mind, now that his ridiculously tall pile of homework was completely finished.He watched and laughed as Peter played Wizard's Chess with Sirius, who was cursing loudly as his pieces were picked apart one-by-one. Chess was one of the only things that Peter was better at than the rest of the Marauders, and it boosted his self-esteem greatly."Knight to A-6 – wait, actually, G-6, WAIT – are you kidding me?""Bishop to G-4 – not you, the other one, stupid – I've got you cornered now! Checkmate, Padfoot!"Remus grabbed the black king from Sirius's side of the chessboard and turned it around his fingers, laughing heartily. Sirius demanded a rematch, to which Peter readily agreed.James smiled lazily. His mind wandered off to what he'd be doing next; it was ten o'clock, maybe he'd get something to bite in the kitchen… smiling inwardly, maybe he could get Lily to accompany him again, she'd loved meeting the House-elves last time...With thoughts about Lily came warm, pleasant memories. He was pleased with the way their relationship was going so far, even if it hadn't gone that far yet. She'd even called him Prongs once or twice that week, though that had mostly been to make fun of him with Sirius. They were good friends now, and progressing quickly. James found that she was just as easy to talk with as Peter was, or Remus, or – hell, even Sirius, his own best mate.Lily and Remus had been good friends ever since they had become prefects in 5th year, remembered James, something that he had taken advantage of once he'd developed feelings for her. Remus had been less than willing to involve himself in their complicated relationship, but James had promised him a whole month's worth of Chocolate Frogs if he talked about how smart he was, or how good he was at Quidditch, or how muscular he was –He chuckled lightly to himself. Merlin, he'd been an immature little prat. They were good memories, fond memories, but he couldn't help but cringe at them. He had resolved long to give up on her – he was just getting his hopes up, and that wouldn't do him any good. He was just fine with them being friends.A light tap on his shoulder snapped him out of his thoughts. He turned his head, and he found the very subject of his inner, most-private fantasies standing behind him, looking slightly awkward."All right, Evans?" said Sirius, not taking his eyes off of the chessboard. "Seen McKinnon?""James, can I have a word?" asked Lily, ignoring Sirius. "Er – privately?""Sure," said James. He got off from his armchair and turned his back to his friends, who catcalled and threw Chess pieces at him. He and Lily walked over to an empty table near the common-room noticeboards."So," began James, "what did you want to talk about?""Right," said Lily. "Er… well, you know how you and Sirius are the only ones who've turned cats into furniture and all that? In Transfiguration?""Yeah," said James, unsure of where this was going. "What of it?"Lily sighed. "James, what I'm asking – well, I want you to help me understand it all."She waited. James stared at her, uncomprehendingly, when suddenly it clicked."You – Lily Evans – want to ask for my help?""Don't be mean," chided Lily, "but, yes, I suppose I do, and since my only options are you and Sirius, and Sirius is… well, a right arse, to be honest – I thought I'd go to the person who'd be the least likely to laugh at me."James's heart tap-danced."I've had trouble understanding Transfiguration since the beginning of the year, see," added Lily with uncertainty."'Course I'll help you, Lils," said James brightly. "Don't be afraid to ask me, all right? And Sirius too, for that matter. He's not into laughing at other people's skills." He pondered his words for a moment, before adding, "Well, most people, anyway. Peter's an exception."Lily laughed at that. "So, you'll teach me, then?""Obviously. We can start now, if you'd like.""Brilliant." Lily's green eyes were shining brightly. She opened her copy of Transfiguring Reality and turned to the page they were currently working on with Professor McGonagall: The Cat, the Mouse, and the Wardrobe."Right," said James, taking out his wand. "Well, first things first – we're going to need either a mouse or a cat. I saw a mouse near the fireplace earlier with a slice of cheese… let me see if I can – Accio Cheese!"The cheese soared over the heads of his fellow Gryffindors, dragging the poor mouse with it as it clung determinedly and it landed on the table. He waved his wand again ("Immobulus!") and the mouse stayed still.It was a rather fat mouse, noted James, and though he knew that it wasn't Wormtail, since he was still sat by the fire playing chess with Sirius, he couldn't help but feel slightly guilty at the thought of using one of his friends as a lab rat. He pushed down his guilt and turned to Lily."Cats are better, of course," he began to explain. "They're durable and flexible, and there are a lot more possibilities when you're using cats. But mice are easier, that's why McGonagall has us using them in her class."He pointed his wand at the mouse and said, "Vera Minima Lectulo!" The mouse shifted and changed; in its place stood a small brown wardrobe about as big as his hand. James opened its doors and found the cheese tucked neatly inside.He undid the spell and the wardrobe turned back into a frozen mouse. He gestured at Lily to try.On her second attempt, the mouse transformed into a simple black closet with mismatched door handles. The cheese was nowhere to be found."Nice one," commented James. "Of course, anything with minima in it is far easier than its usual spell. But you've got the basics, so it shouldn't be as hard. And also remember – McGonagall wants us practising nonverbal spells. Reparifarge."The wardrobe changed back into a mouse (cheese gone) and James set it on the floor, away from the table. The common room was emptying now, and the space in front of them was wide open."I'm going to turn it into an actual wardrobe, now," said James, and Lily nodded impatiently, her face scrunched up in concentration as to what he was doing.He jabbed his wand at the mouse, thought, Vera Lectulo! and the mouse blurred and expanded before it stood straight up, its fur slowly browning and hardening; it stretched out, warping and shifting, and then a set of wooden doors appeared, and then its walls and its top, and then it all closed with a snap.Once again, he undid the transformation and told Lily to try it out. She raised her wand and began her barrage of spellwork.Lily waved and swished and even muttered the spell, but the mouse didn't budge. James waited for a few moments until he'd decided that she'd suffered enough."You're flourishing your wand a bit too much," said James, as Lily despaired. "It's more a straight jab.""What difference will that make?" seethed Lily, scowling at the mouse. "Even if I did do that –" and she did, jabbing her wand straight at the mouse, but it stayed in place stubbornly "– see! I'm doing something wrong. There's got to be another way.""I think you're thinking a bit too much into this," said James thoughtfully. "You're going about it the wrong way. You're trying to figure out how to go around the problem, instead of facing it head-on. This isn't Charms, Lily. There aren't other methods or different ways to solve things in Transfiguration. We have formulas and laws.""Right," said Lily, seemingly unsure of where this was going next.James gestured at her textbook. There was a large triangle over one of its pages, with different symbols and letters: the Transformation Formula."Even if you are applying the formula," continued James, "you have to visualize. There's so much more to it than just simply imagining a mouse turning into furniture. You have to imagine the mouse's skin turning into wood, its skeleton into the doors or handles or whatever; it doesn't matter. As long as you're visualizing… sort of like a moving painting or picture.""Like a video?""What's that?" asked James curiously. He'd never heard that word before."Never mind," said Lily hurriedly. "OK, so a moving painting… got it."Lily turned her attention to the mouse. She did as James said – a mental replay of the mouse turning into the bed, and she brought her wand down in a straight flick; the mouse changed into a white wardrobe."I did it!" exclaimed Lily, jumping slightly. A couple of Gryffindors looked around curiously, and then Lily blushed and sat down again."Brilliant, Lils!" said James, and he couldn't help but smile; her happiness was infectious. "On your first try, too. That was great."Lily beamed at him. "Thank you, thank you, I've finally got it now, I don't have to pretend to sleep in McGonagall's class anymore!"She and James laughed. Over by the fire, the Marauders shared smiles with each other. They'd been watching from afar."Don't mention it, Lily," said James, leaning back into his chair. "Though… I hope this doesn't mean that you'll top me in Transfiguration."Lily snorted. "As if that's possible." She sighed contentedly and leaned back, copying James.James closed his eyes, still marvelling at the fact that he was actually sitting with Lily Evans, and she wasn't yelling or trying to get away from him. A few years ago, that would have sounded like a dream."You know," continued Lily, "You're a really good teacher, James. Maybe you should take over for McGonagall once she retires."It was James's turn to snort. "While I appreciate the compliment, I don't think I could ever settle down as a Professor. I'm way too much of a troublemaker. There's no way I could make a bunch of hormonal teenagers take me seriously.""Really?" asked Lily quietly. "Because people can change, you know. You've changed."James crossed his arms. "Yeah, well…""It's a rather pleasant change, too," said Lily, looking at him. "It's quite nice."James looked back at her. What was she saying?"Besides, James," said Lily suddenly, after a few minutes of silence between them. "You're the Transfiguration prodigy. You're the one who should be an expert on change."On Tuesday, Lily woke up a little later than usual, having spent most of last night studying. Figuring that it was probably 8 o'clock, she bustled about in her room, brushing her teeth and washing her hair. After deeming herself presentable, she opened her curtains, where she was immediately greeted by a fresh ray of bright sunlight – and she instantly panicked.Reaching for her watch, she realised she had ten minutes to get to class. Her heart rose to her throat – she'd never been late, not in any of her seven years at Hogwarts, and she wasn't going to start now. Lily stuffed her textbooks into her bag and hurried out of her door, accepting that she wasn't going to be eating until lunch. Her stomach rumbled, which did not help, but she pushed down her hunger and raced out of the Tower.James was probably already in class, which meant that she wouldn't be able to use his shortcuts. She descended the Grand Staircase, passing by the near-empty Great Hall, and just barely reached the oak doors as the bell rang.She shut her eyes; the sound of the bell was a cruel reminder that she was late. Dragging her feet out of the doors, she made her way to Greenhouse Three for Herbology. She gave a hurried apology to Professor Sprout, who just bade her sit down, and collapsed on the only empty seat: the one next to James.She couldn't bring herself to focus on whatever Professor Sprout was saying; it was as though her day was destined to be bad. Instead she busied herself with her gloomy thoughts, wondering whether this would stain her record and cause her to get in trouble with McGonagall, which would lead to trouble with Dumbledore, and then the governors, and oh no, she would lose her badge, she would forever be known as the Head Girl who hadn't lasted a single month and would ultimately fail to get a job –"Miss Evans!"She looked up, her eyes wide. Professor Sprout was frowning at her, looking torn between disapproval and concern. She felt James's eyes on her as she squeaked out an almost inaudible, "Yes, Professor?""Are you ready to participate in class, or are you still going to stare off into the distance?""I – no…" she muttered, feeling herself get red as the class tittered. "I mean – yes, I'm ready to participate. I'm sorry, Professor."Professor Sprout gave her one last miffy look and turned back to the class at large, this time holding a large, potted plant. Lily sank lower into her chair, trying desperately to disappear forever…Suddenly, there was a great rumble as everyone got up, and, realising that she had zoned out yet again, she stared around. People were getting into pairs; she saw Sirius and Remus wander off to an empty table. What was going on?"Lily?"James's voice made her jump slightly. She turned to look at him, his hazel eyes amused and concerned. She shook her head; this was no time to get lost again."Yes?" she said, in what she thought was a dignified voice. James smirked."Well, don't just stand there, help me get this Whomping Willow over here –"He heaved a great potted plant, the same as Professor Sprout's, and Lily hurried over to help. They both managed to set it on to their table, where he looked at her expectantly."What?" she said."We're supposed to get these things to trust us," said James, gesturing at the plant. "Professor Sprout reckons that a girl is better suited for the job. Something about the way you smell?""Oh," said Lily, turning to look at the plant. It was large and wilted, and it reminded her of one of those bonsai trees that Petunia had brought home. She reached a hand out tentatively to touch it, but before she could so much as brush against the leaves, the tree lashed out and struck her thumb.Eyes watering, she pulled back her hand and sucked on her thumb, biting down so that the pain would stop. She glared angrily at the tree, but the tree remained still."Are you hurt?" asked James concernedly. "Let me take a look –"But Lily shook his hand off, unwilling to accept help. She could deal with a simple cut. "I'm fine.""All right, no need to get angry," said James uneasily, holding his hands up in a placating gesture. "Why don't you sit down? I'll try to get this thing under control."Lily shook her head stubbornly. "I told you, I'm fine. Now what're we supposed to do with these things?"Still looking unconvinced, James explained that she had to approach it quickly, confidently – Whomping Willows were proud plants, but would yield if they managed to get intimidated. Lily squared her shoulders, and, following James's instructions, she immediately lunged for the trunk of the tree; its branches lifted in surprise, and then it wilted again, as though it had just been defeated. Satisfied, she turned back to James."Now what?""Now," said James, lifting a pair of shears, "we prune the leaves."The rest of the lesson passed quickly. She handed in her and James's pile of pruned leaves, noticing that it was considerably smaller than the rest of her peers', but she couldn't bring herself to care. She had Ancient Runes next, and then a free period after. Resigning herself to an extra couple of hours of sleep and hunger, she shouldered her bag."Oi, Lily!"James again. She sighed, not in the mood to talk with anybody. She turned around, about to tell him off, but then James said, "What's gotten into you?"Blunt and swift. Lily, surprised, opened her mouth to retort, but James beat her to it."I mean, it's not like you at all to be late, or to miss breakfast," said James, a smirk growing on his lips. "I don't ever recall seeing you zone out in class, either –""James, if you're just going to remind me what a disorganized, messy person I am –""Fancy a trip to the kitchens?""I – what?" she stared at him in confusion. Had she heard him right? "The kitchens?"James shrugged, lifting a hand up to his hair. "Well, you seem to have a thing for missing breakfast, so I thought – well, maybe you were hungry, and you'd accompany me to the kitchens…?"Lily stared at him. "James, don't you have History of Magic next –?""It's not like Binns'll notice me skiving or anything," said James, grinning crookedly. "And I'm sure Professor Vector will give you a pass. I've said this before, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You can't miss it!"As if on cue, her stomach rumbled. She patted it, scolding herself mentally for being weak. "Well, I suppose – but I don't really fancy missing class...""What?" James looked aghast, and he pulled her by the elbow away from the students streaming out of the greenhouse. "What do you mean, you don't fancy missing class? Don't tell me you actually like Ancient Runes?""I'll have you know, James, that Ancient Runes is an amazing subject –""It's boring, that's what it is, and I dunno how you or Remus can stand it," said James, his hand travelling down her arm to clasp her palm. "I swear, Evans, it's as if you have an aversion to fun or something.""I have fun," said Lily defensively, following James down to the route they had gone on a few weeks ago. "I mean, it's just – I separate it from school and all…""You're long overdue for some rule-breaking," said James firmly, reaching the painting of the pear. "And here I was thinking Marlene made you tag along whenever she did something…""As a matter of fact, she does." Lily waved at the House-Elves merrily. "It's not like I can stop her or anything."James sat down across her. "Maybe there's hope for you yet."She stuck her tongue out at him.They spent the two periods chatting with the house-elves and eating themselves silly. They skipped lunch, which she thought for the best, as the food here was heaps better than the food in the Great Hall. She had to admit, it felt fun to be free of Babbling's voice, but she couldn't help but feel scared that the professors would come looking for them. She voiced her fears to James, who chuckled."You're just overreacting," said James, munching on a chocolate tart. "I've done things much worse than miss class, and McGonagall still loves me."Lily snorted."Say, Lily," began James in a voice very different from the one he had used before, "What do you say we do something after this?""Oh? And what did you have in mind?"James scratched the back of his head. There were a few crumbs of chocolate on his chin that Lily wanted to wipe away. "I was thinking... something along the lines of Berkana in Fehu, if you catch my drift...?"Lily stared at him, trying to ignore the way her stomach flip-flopped as she realized what he was saying. "James, that is the most pathetic pick-up line I have heard, and I'm friends with Sirius.""Worth a shot," grinned James cheekily. "Seems that the Ancient Runes that I picked up from Remus didn't all go to waste."She rolled her eyes at him playfully, masking her wide smile with her syllabub. "Has anyone ever told you you have the mind of a twelve-year-old?""If I recall correctly, you've reminded me without fail for the last six years.""Consider yourself reminded again."James grinned again, his hazel eyes sparkling. "I will, because I'm a nice person. A dear, if you will. An... Algiz?""Close enough," said Lily sniffily. "Algiz stands for elk, not deer. And stop it with the Ancient Runes, you're scaring me."When she heard the bell ring, she convinced James to come with her, as it was Charms next. She left the kitchens in far higher spirits than she had upon entering it.That night, in the Gryffindor common room, she found herself feeling incredibly lonely as she sat with her friends around the fire. She mostly stayed quiet, speaking only when she was spoken to, and not contributing to the conversation.She sighed, leaning back into her sofa. Marlene and James were still in the Quidditch pitch, so maybe that was why she was feeling this way. She knew it wasn't fair to Alice – she loved her like a sister, but sometimes the girl would always forget who was around her. At the moment, Alice was chatting with Remus and Peter about who-knew-what, and Sirius was being his usual, obnoxious self by flicking paper-balls towards the heads of unsuspecting second years.She didn't know why she was suddenly missing James. Marlene, she could understand – she was her best friend, obviously – but James? Why, in the overwhelming crowd that was the Gryffindor common room, did she suddenly desire for his company more than Marlene's?Perhaps it was because he had gone out of his way to help her feel better. Or perhaps it was because she spent so much more time with him than either Marlene or Alice these days. Or perhaps it was because things were much less boring with him around. He always knew what to say to defuse the situation, or, if he was feeling like it, escalate it a hundredfold. Lily found herself glancing at the portrait hole, praying that either one of her friends would climb out and save her from her boredom.Berkana in Fehu... she had to admit, that boy could get creative with his words. She snorted lightly to herself.She reached into her bag and pulled out a book. The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a short collection of tales James had given to her ages ago, before what had happened in the Lake. Smiling slightly at the thought of reading about a warlock's hairy heart, she opened the pages and sank into the stories.Half an hour later, having thoroughly exhausted the contents of the children's book, she closed it. She glanced at the portrait hole again, wondering why James was taking so long. It was well past dinner, after all – surely, he would take pity on his team and let them eat. If he wasn't showing any time soon, then Lily might as well pack up and leave for her Tower.She hummed absently to herself, stuffing her book back into her bag. She stared around the common room, noticing that Em and Mary had already gone up after finishing their game of Gobstones. Perhaps she should have played with them; if anything, to take her mind off of things. She was about to stand up when a sudden tap on her shoulder snapped her out of her thoughts.Spinning around, she saw a messy-haired, bespectacled boy grinning down at her from behind the sofa, his scarlet Quidditch robes caked with mud and grass."When did you get back?" said Lily, surprised.James jumped over the sofa and sank into the cushions, propping his feet over the desk. "Missed me, did you?""No," lied Lily. "I didn't see you go through the portrait hole."He shrugged, covering the back pillows with grass. "I came back a few minutes ago. You looked busy."Lily glanced at her heavy bag, where The Tales of Beedle the Bard was stashed safely in one of the pockets. She was strangely attached to the book. "I was reading.""Very interesting," said James sarcastically, tossing a Quaffle up into the air that he'd procured from seemingly nowhere. "Might I ask what you were reading?""Just a children's book," she answered, not wanting to tell him that she had been reading something he had given her. "Is Marlene here?""She's probably taking a bath," said James, glancing up at the ceiling. "We had a rough practice today, Hector and Paris Salley were being quite rude to everyone.""Hmm," said Lily absently. "And why aren't you taking a bath?""Sirius is hogging the bathroom," said James. "I'll shower in the Head's dorm later."Soon, Lily began to relax as her boredom came to an end. She didn't notice Marlene and Alice glance at her happily, nor did she notice Sirius smile at them from the boys' stairs. She didn't even notice the common room slowly empty as curfew drew near. She felt like she could talk to James about anything – his presence was so reassuring, so comfortable, she felt her inner shields go down and let him enter, and they sank into their own little world.

Chapter Seven: The Gathering of Many FacesThe full moon rose over the grounds of Hogwarts, basking the castle and its trees in silvery light. Off in the distance, near the border where Hogsmeade and the highlands converged, the sound of screaming rolled through the grounds.The Shrieking Shack lived up to its name. To Hogsmeade, the wails of the petrified dead were a sign of bad luck. To the Marauders, it indicated that the wolf was emerging.Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs stood to the corner of the Shack, waiting patiently for Remus to finish his transformation. It always started slowly: Remus would pant repeatedly like a wounded dog, then he would start thrashing around, screeching and shouting as his bones elongated and his skin broke apart, his eyes wild and feral, and then...Silence. The wolf had appeared.Prongs and Padfoot looked at each other, gleeful expressions on their animal faces. Wormtail climbed up onto the back of the stag, holding on to his fur.The great dog gave a raucous BARK, and Moony turned to look at them. He grinned, baring his sharp teeth.The wolf raised his head, facing the night sky, and he howled. He poured his pain and lament into a single note; a hymn of magic. But Moony sang not only to the moon, but to his friends too. The prospect of adventure energized him, and he couldn't wait to cause some more mischief.Padfoot barked again, sounding more alert and impatient this time. He pushed open a loose plank of wood in the wall and squeezed through it, holding it open so that Prongs and Moony could come out.The Marauders breathed in the smell of the Forbidden Forest. Then Moony gave a great yelp and bounded towards the woods, his friends right behind him.The golden leaves of September continued to fall all the way up to October, and by the first Friday of the month McGonagall had already asked James and Lily to start planning for the upcoming festival: The Gathering of Many Faces.Lily thought that that was a rather long and fancy name for a costume party, but she didn't object. During the meeting with James and the other prefects, she and the Head Boy stole glances at each other as they listened to the others' ideas. She'd vetoed anything that she found too complicated, fearing that that would cut down on productivity. James just sat there on his seat, once or twice looking at the ceiling as if to say, Why me?She couldn't blame him. After all, McGonagall had tasked James with the worst and hardest jobs. Lily was thankful, of course, but she couldn't help but think that James had received barely any part of the broomstick.So it was on the evening of Sunday that she found James sprawled on one of the common room's many sofas all by himself, consulting a long list of names that he would have to call. Remus had been there a few hours ago, helping him plan the layout of the Great Hall on the day of the festival. Ever since, James had been writing letters to people, begging them to come play at their costume party. McGonagall had insisted he get a good band to come to Hogwarts, and the rest of the prefects had fervently requested for the Crimson Children, who were apparently a new band in the craze. No doubt the same, gormless squealing sound, thought Lily.She sat down on the chair next to James's sofa. "Any luck?""None," said James gloomily. "They're all busy at the end of the month. These Crimson Children – I've never even heard of them, and I grew up with wizarding music.""Well, I'm sure you'll come up with something," said Lily encouragingly.James groaned. She smiled sympathetically and searched through her bag, determined to get some work done. She found her potions essay and began to read it."Why couldn't The Beatles have disbanded after we graduated?" said James grumpily. "I doubt they'd turn down an offer to play at Hogwarts."Lily laughed. "The Beatles would've been nice, actually. See if you can get your band to cover one of their songs."James didn't answer. He flipped over on the couch, his eyes crossing slightly as they zoomed all over the parchment. Lily worked silently beside him, reading over her texts and scratching out mistakes."Hey, Lily?"She looked up from her essay. "Yes?"James squinted at his list. "Have you ever heard of this band – The Weird Sisters?"She shook her head. "No, doesn't ring a bell.""Huh," said James, frowning slightly. "It says here they're quite new. D'you think McGonagall will approve?""Please, James. Do you honestly think McGonagall actually cares about the music? It's the students you'll have to please.""You've got a point there," admitted James. "Maybe I will book these guys. If anything, just to spite Benjy Fenwick."Lily and James shared a laugh. Benjy had been one of the most vocal supporters of the Crimson Children – something that James found quite irritating, apparently."Well, as long as they're nice, I don't really care," said Lily."That's settled, then," said James. He rolled up his list and stuffed it in his bag. "What're you working on?"Lily glanced at him, then turned back to her homework. "Slughorn's essay on the moon. I'm nearly finished, I just need to add a conclusion."James sighed. "Hold on a sec, I'm almost done with mine."He dashed towards his room, leaving Lily alone in her armchair. She waited patiently as James rummaged around upstairs, no doubt looking for his aforementioned potions essay. He came back down a few minutes later holding a crumpled piece of parchment.Lily wrinkled her nose. "Is that supposed to be what you're turning in tomorrow?"James shrugged easily. "Sluggy doesn't really care as long as he can read my handwriting, so I don't see why I – or you – should care."She rolled her eyes. "Forget I asked, then. Give it here, I'll read it over."James handed it to her and he slumped back down on the sofa, rubbing his eyes. "You are honestly the most amazing, wonderful witch I've ever met, Evans.""Someone's been working on their flattery," muttered Lily, though she was quite flattered. She read over his essay, comparing it to hers. Merlin, his handwriting was bad. It could have given Marlene's a run for its money. Who knew that flying around in a broom would cause permanent damage to their fingers?She said as much to James, who chuckled. "Yeah, my mum's crazy about my handwriting as well. She reckons Marlene's is worse, though.""Your mum knows Marlene?" asked Lily, flipping over his essay so that she could read the back."Oh, yeah, of course she knows her," answered James, laying down so that he was facing the ceiling. "Marlene used to come over nearly every week before we went to Hogwarts, her family and mine are old friends. We're practically cousins. Hasn't she ever mentioned that?""I think she has, but I don't remember," said Lily absently. She gave him his homework. "That looks fine, James. I'd add something about how the moon cycle influences a potion's temperature, and then finish it with a conclusion.""Right," said James. He scribbled down what looked like Nordic runes to Lily on his parchment."Speaking of moons," said Lily slowly, remembering something that had been bugging her for a while, "Where were you during Remus's transformation?"James waved his hand carelessly. "You know, the usual.""But what is the usual?" persisted Lily. "Surely you do something.""Yeah, we do," said James. "Peter worries, so we wait in the Hospital Wing for Remus to get back."Lily stared at him. Usually, James Potter was infamous for his believable lies. Hell, he'd gotten his whole reputation due to his ability to lie and cause mischief. But now, with James avoiding her eyes as she scrutinized him carefully, she couldn't help but think that that was one of the most feeble excuses she'd ever heard."If you don't want to tell me, then just say so, James," she said, turning back to her parchment. "I'm not going to push you.""Well, what else are we going to do?" demanded James. "I'm telling you, it's the truth! I mean, we can't exactly keep Remus company as mere mortals, can we?"Lily had to admit that that was true. She looked at him silently, fully appreciating the fact that his shirt was rather tight and rippled whenever he moved. His glasses were slightly lopsided and their lenses were foggy. She noticed the way he kept ruffling his hair, and she had the intense desire to bury her hands in it."Looking at something, Evans?"Lily snapped out of her thoughts. "In your dreams, Potter."James smirked. He threw down his quill on the table, finally finished with his essay.Lily and James left the common room shortly after for dinner.She sidled onto her bench next to Alice, who was talking animatedly with Remus. She drowned out the noise of conversation and piled her plate with foodLily glanced at Remus briefly. He looked quite pale, but, then again, he always looked pale. He had a look of sleepy contentedness on his scarred face. Some of his wounds looked to be fresh, but they were healing, Lily noted.She did some calculations in her head. She was no Arithmancy genius, but if her maths were correct the full moon had been a little more than a week ago.What did James do during the full moon? Obviously, they couldn't keep Remus company as humans, since werewolves were deadly to them. James himself had said so, and Lily agreed, and now she was stumped.Werewolves. Misunderstood, yet, at the same time, Lily couldn't help but be scared of them.Some of her previous words echoed in her mind. They couldn't keep him company as humans…Something bothered her about that sentence. Keep him company as humans…As humans…A thought came to her suddenly. A ridiculous notion, yet she seriously considered it.But… no, not even James or Sirius would be able to pull that off, at least not while they were at school. That was much too advanced and much too dangerous.No, decided Lily. It was something else. No 17 year old was going to be turning into Animagi any time soon.Though, there was that one time in fourth year, when James had asked her a question up-close, and all she could think of was oddly his breath had smelled. It had been a strangely familiar scent, like something she'd inhaled before. Something earthy and plantlike.Something to do with Animagi.Lily tried to reassure herself."Are you all right, Lily?" asked Alice, concern evident in big brown eyes. "You look as though Slughorn's just thrown you out of the Slug Club."Lily shook her head and tried to smile in spite of herself. "I'm fine, Al. As for Slughorn – we all know that's impossible.""Someone's got a rather high opinion of herself," commented Sirius mildly from across her. He'd already finished his potatoes and had moved on to his slice of pumpkin pie.Lily narrowed her eyes at him. "You know it's true, Black.""Are we back to last names again?" asked Sirius innocently. "Because I was getting rather fond of hearing my name stretched out between your lovely lips –"James smacked him around the head. "Stop harassing everyone and eat your sodding food.""Ah," said Sirius, though Lily couldn't tell if he was hurt or just acting sagely. "And that's why you're going to miss out on all the fun, my fellow Marauder.""What?"Sirius waved his fork idly. "You'll see." He glanced up at the staff table and smirked. "Right about… now."Suspicious, Lily whipped her head at the staff table in front of the Great Hall – McGonagall had just appeared, looking dignified – she pulled up her chair beside Dumbledore's, who greeted her as he usually did, like an eccentric old man – and began to eat.Lily held her breath, and it appeared that everyone else did, too. James kept darting his eyes between Sirius and McGonagall, looking apprehensive."Padfoot, maybe you should call it off," said Remus anxiously. "I'm starting to think this isn't a good idea…""Nonsense, Moony, all ideas are good ideas, especially when they come from me," replied Sirius. "Besides, we're far too gone to back out."McGonagall kept eating, talking to Dumbledore in-between bites. This was one of those rare moments in which she didn't look stern, and instead looked at ease."Padfoot, whatever you're doing…" warned James, looking very much like McGonagall. Marlene glared at Sirius, a sure sign that things would go bad if he didn't stop.But Sirius shook his head again, a wicked smile growing on his lips."Now."As soon as McGonagall shoved her spoon into her food, the plate started to vibrate. Surprised, McGonagall dropped her utensils, but she wasn't the only one; all along the staff table, the Professors gave startled cries as their food started to dance. McGonagall pushed away from her chair, looking apprehensive."What in Merlin's name –" she started.The Gryffindors weren't the only ones who were looking on with bated breath – other students from different houses were beginning to notice now, some pointing and whispering and laughing at the sight of the alarmed professors. Only Dumbledore looked relatively normal, and he ate his shepherd's pie with gusto.Suddenly, the plates lifted themselves into the air – they twitched once, some twitched twice – and regurgitated forth a torrent of food and sauce that flew towards the teachers. McGonagall got a faceful of mashed potatoes and gravy.Sirius's laugh died down shortly as the victims rounded on the Gryffindor table. Everyone had been hit – everyone except for Dumbledore, who looked on with amused interest.McGonagall wiped her square spectacles with the back of her hand and turned to the four culprits – three, if James's apprehension earlier was anything to go by. Lily sang a song appropriate for a funeral inside her head as McGonagall straightened to her full height, her eyes seething with rage and her mouth so thin Lily thought she looked rather like a cat."Potter, Black, Lupin, Pettigrew," said McGonagall in a voice of steely calm. "My office – now."James sighed and gave Sirius a look that spelt, I'll kill you later. Sirius only smirked good-naturedly at him, and the four boys trudged single-file behind McGonagall.Marlene laughed, and the rest of the table joined in.Well, thought Lily, and even from two floors below, she thought she could hear McGonagall screeching like a banshee. So much for change.Though, Hogwarts wouldn't be nearly as fun without the Marauders. Lily admitted that much."What the bloody hell is going on between you and James?" asked Alice one evening at the library. Lily and her two best friends were sitting on one of the tables, catching up on their assignments.It was Wednesday, her least favourite day of the week, and Lily had a hard time coming up with an excuse for Alice. She'd just gotten out of Arithmancy with Marlene, and both girls had agreed that Professor Vector was slightly mad when it came to homework."Nothing's going on," said Lily, not looking up from her book. In truth, she didn't know what was going on between her and James.She liked him, Lily could fully admit that now, and James liked her, he'd made that perfectly clear in years past. In the few short weeks that they'd been back at Hogwarts, she and James had been perfectly nice to each other; perhaps a little too nice, thought Lily.But Alice scoffed. "Don't give me that rubbish, all you've done now that you're Head Girl is hang out with James, you never have time for us anymore…""Is that what this is about?" asked Lily, amused. "I promise, after I'm done with this festival, we're going to have a day all to ourselves. No stupid Gryffindor blokes. Right, Marlene?"Marlene grunted, her nose nearly touching her parchment as she scribbled down her notes. "I s'pose.""But you do like him?" inquired Alice, her brown eyes searching her face questioningly.Lily sighed. "It's complicated, Al.""Trust me, Alice, it's not," said Marlene. "Lily's been secretly snogging James in their little common room whenever we're not looking.""I have not," said Lily scathingly as Alice laughed. "And even if I was, what would it matter?""It matters to us, Lil," said Alice, turning back to her book, "because you'd be admitting defeat.""What in Merlin's name is that supposed to mean?"Marlene sighed dramatically. "She's too far gone, Al, I don't think we can save her…""Oh, bugger off, the pair of you," growled Lily, throwing a piece of paper at Marlene. "I don't like him. Happy?""We saw you two going off all by yourselves a few weeks ago," said Marlene, scrunching the paper into a ball and throwing it back at her. "Forgive me if that doesn't look a little suggestive.""For Merlin's sake, we were going to the kitchens!" cried out Lily exasperatedly. Madam Pince gave her the evil eye, and she smiled sheepishly at her before turning back to her friends, "We were going to the kitchens! If I remember correctly, I brought you and Alice enough pastries to fill your dorms!""Yes, and they were delicious," sniggered Marlene. "But the fact still remains that you went off by yourselves…""That's rich, coming from Miss I-shag-Sirius-Black-in-the-Astronomy-Tower," seethed Lily. She rounded on Alice. "I don't see her getting interrogated, why's that, Alice dear?""Because, Lilyyy," said Alice, stretching out the syllables. "Marlene's already dating Sirius, so there's no need to interrogate her.""Besides, Sirius and I aren't that serious anyway." Marlene didn't even smirk at her pun. "We meet each other after curfew, have an hour or two of fun, and go about our day. Whereas you, Lily…""What about me?" snapped Lily."Shut up," hissed Alice before Marlene could answer, as Madam Pince shuffled towards their direction."We've seen you and James dance around each other for the better part of two years," whispered Marlene. "It's bound to happen eventually, don't you think, Alice?""Definitely," said Alice, as Lily groaned in exasperation. "I tell you, Marls, by the end of the year Lily and James will be singing our praises.""Oh, not even." Marlene's eyes were shining. "A galleon that they don't even last till the end of the month."Lily pinched the bridge of her nose, wondering how on earth she got stuck with two of the most annoying friends in the world.They continued to tease her after that, but Lily drowned out the noise. She worked silently on her dragon essay.Fifteen minutes later, she heard Alice snap her book shut, cursing Professor Hedith and her stupid dragons, and took out a piece of parchment. Marlene had given up a long time ago, and was now doodling aimlessly with a pencil.Lily tucked her books back into her bag and glanced at Alice, now writing what appeared to be a novel. "What's that?""A letter," answered Alice. "To Frank," she added to Lily's questioning look. "He's just finished the first stage of Auror Training, so they're giving him a few days off.""Frank Longbottom's an Auror?" asked Marlene, a look of surprise on her face."Yes," said Alice a little defensively, "Why?"Marlene waved her hand vaguely and turned back to her drawing. "Nothing, Al. Curiosity, ever heard of it?"Alice ignored her, instead choosing to continue to write her letter. Lily watched her silently, noticing how her face relaxed when she was thinking about Frank.She scribbled down her signature and rolled up her parchment. "Shall we go? We're not getting anything done here."The three girls exited the library, heading for dinner in the Great Hall. They caught up with Mary and Emmeline on their way."Lily, Lily, Lily," sang Marlene suddenly as they passed through a hallway filled with suits of armour. "Don't you know that delay is the deadliest form of denial?"For the next few weeks, James was so busy he hardly had any time left for mischief-making, which was probably why Sirius had left him in the dark on the whole McGonagall thing.He was still quite miffed that Sirius hadn't at least informed him what he was going to do to McGonagall beforehand. In retrospect, though, James probably would've tried to stop him, since he was Head Boy and needed to keep up images.Now was no time for pranks, though, for as the date of the upcoming festival loomed closer, James's workload doubled by the day.He and the rest of the 7th-years were starting to feel just how stressful things at Hogwarts could be. If James was being honest with himself, he was doing far better than the other students in terms of homework – better, at least, than Peter, who was so far behind in Charms that Flitwick had called him to his office personally.His evenings were filled with the sound of quills scratching on parchment as he worked on his essays. Sometimes, Sirius and Remus and Peter were there to help him; other times, he completed just as much with Lily.As for the Gathering of Many Faces (which, he'd been informed, was actually the 50th anniversary of the death of some wizard), things were going smoothly. James and Lily occasionally spent their breaks hunched over a diagram of the Great Hall, plotting the events and celebrations. He'd bought a tape of The Weird Sisters' debut album, listened to it using Lily's wireless, and had ultimately decided that he rather liked this weird band. The highlight of his week: they'd actually responded and accepted his offer, and had even sent him some free merchandise, which James hung up proudly in his room.Three days before the festival, James and the rest of the Marauders met up in their common room to discuss what they'd be wearing, something that James found quite silly.He'd been listening to Peter drone on and on about the types of costumes he wanted to wear, ranging from an outfit that looked a bit like a bear that he said he'd gotten from a movie called Star Wars (James had no idea what a movie was, nor why stars were trying to do each other in), to a muscle suit with a bat cowl covering his face."You look ridiculous, Wormtail," said Sirius lazily from his spot on the couch. "Take that off, will you?"Peter sighed. "If you insist."He Vanished his cape and mask and plumped back down in his armchair. Remus glanced up from his book, amused."We need to think of something," murmured Sirius. "It's our last year, for Merlin's sake, and Dumbledore's given us permission to go as anything. So why haven't we thought of anything?""Do our costumes have to match?" asked Remus carefully. Sirius rounded on him, an incredulous look on his face."Why wouldn't we have matching costumes?""Because, Padfoot," said Remus, rolling his eyes, "we'll look like even bigger dorks than we already are –""We're not dorks!" protested James.Remus laughed. "Please, Prongs. We have codenames for each other."James and Sirius shut up after that."Oh, I know," said Remus suddenly. He snapped his book shut and sat up, giving the boys his full attention. "How about we go as something cool? Something everyone will love.""That's what I've been saying, Moony," said Sirius exasperatedly, closing his eyes and leaning against one of his pillows. "The thing is – what counts as cool in this place?""I'll tell you." Remus regarded his four friends carefully. "But I'm afraid the process in which to get those four costumes will be a rather long and winding road…"Remus waited patiently as the gears turned slowly in his friends' heads. Suddenly, Sirius' face brightened, and he grinned widely."Moony, you might just be a genius," said Sirius, sliding off of his sofa. "Why didn't I think of that?"James and Peter eyed the others confusedly. "What –""Oh, nevermind, you two," said Remus impatiently, though his eyes were twinkling. "You really ought to get some help, if you haven't yet gotten it…""Help –?" James's eyes widened. "Oh – OH – Moony, you're brilliant, you are.""I don't get it," said Peter, his watery eyes squinting slightly. Sirius rolled his eyes."Don't be thick, Wormy, honestly –""Just leave him be," said Remus firmly. "We can work out the finer details with him later, Wormy can wait."The rest of the boys laughed, but Peter just stared at them, a bewildered look on his face."I still don't get it."On the afternoon of the 31st of October, James and Lily were standing in the middle of the Great Hall, now decorated as it usually was for Hallowe'en, waving their wands in a careful manner as dancing skeletons and cackling pumpkins soared through the air. They'd been excused from classes by Dumbledore and McGonagall to work on the festival, and it was really coming along well, if James said so himself.The four house tables had been decorated with jack-o-lanterns and jack-in-the-boxes and who knew what other jacks. The plan was to have the feast first; therefore, the house tables would be needed. After the feast, fourth-year students and older were permitted to stay in the Great Hall till midnight, in which the festival would officially end.James got on one of the tables, scanning the mass of unlit candles laid out on the floor. His mind flitted back to his first year, when he'd met Sirius, and when things seemed so much simpler. Smiling slightly, he swished his wand and flicked"Wingardium Leviosa!"The candles rose to the air, nearly reaching the ceiling."Nice touch," commented Lily. "But what if the wax falls on a student?"James shook his head mischievously. "I think you forget, Evans, that we're at Hogwarts. These are enchanted candles from Zonko's, they won't be waxing off anytime soon."Lily had no time to retort, for at that moment, the Great Hall's double doors opened and in strode Dumbledore, leading a group of six men, all with wild-looking hair, and all carrying bulging bags. The Weird Sisters!James jumped off of his table and hurried towards them, dragging Lily as he did so. Dumbledore smiled proudly as he surveyed the room. "The Great Hall looks spectacular! An excellent idea, to have floating candles. Perhaps we'll use them more often from now on.""Thanks, Professor," said James quickly, and then he turned to the man at the front of the group. "Myron Wagtail? Big fan."Myron Wagtail looked surprised, but he extended a hand to James, who grasped it excitedly. "Thanks, Potter. You don't know what it means, letting us play here.""Couldn't have asked anyone else," said James proudly. He gestured towards the dais that usually held the staff table. "You're going to be performing there, after the feast. We'll have a stage ready and everything.""Right," said Myron, nodding good-naturedly. His long hair bounced up and down as he moved his head.James felt Lily nudge him, and he looked at her confusedly before turning back to The Weird Sisters, now remembering. "Oh yeah, my friend here has a request, if it isn't much trouble?""Depends," said Myron, shouldering his bag. "What sort of request?""We were wondering," began James, "if you could play the Beatles as your closing act? Should round off the night in a memorable way, don't you think?""Everyone loves the Beatles," piped in Lily. "I guarantee that your popularity will skyrocket after this, Mr Wagtail.""I see," said Myron. He looked quite flustered to have been called 'Mr Wagtail' and turned to his bandmates. "Well, what do you say? Some good Muggle music to end our gig?""Why not?" said a pale-looking young man with short hair. "Should be fun."Dumbledore kept turning his head back and forth between the two parties, evidently surprised that they were friendly with each other."Well! It seems that you are all well acquainted, so I see no reason to make introductions," said Dumbledore, and he bowed to The Weird Sisters, who bowed back and shuffled off to prepare their gear. "Miss Evans, you must tell me more about this Beatles band that you are speaking of. I shall take my leave. I will be looking forward to tonight!""We'll see you, Professor," said James, inclining his head slightly. The Headmaster smiled and exited the Great Hall."I reckon we're done here," said Lily, eyeing her work one last time. "We should get back to the common room."A couple of hours later, James and the rest of the Marauders donned matching black suits and ties. Sirius had charmed sideburns onto his face, and Remus and Peter had both grown moustaches.James rubbed his hair with his dad's very own invention: Sleekeazy's Hair Potion, and, true to its saying, his hair softened and straightened."Come on, then," said Sirius, pushing the door open. "Can't wait to dance with Marls.""Tonight marks the fiftieth anniversary of Harry Houdini's death," boomed Dumbledore. "We celebrate him, for not only was he a great wizard, but because he managed to show a little part of our world to our Muggle brethren in a way that would become unforgettable for them. For Harry Houdini."James raised his glass of Butterbeer. The toast was repeated by the hundreds of students present in the Great Hall. "For Harry Houdini."It was his turn now to speak. Dumbledore stepped back, and suddenly the light turned to James."Sonorus," he muttered, pointing his wand at his throat. He cleared his voice, which sounded like an elephant trumpeting now, and addressed the students. "And now, ladies and gentlemen, for this evening's entertainment, I present – no, Fenwick, it's not who you think it is – THE WEIRD SISTERS!"There was a bang and smoke appeared on the stage; for a moment all was quiet, and James thought that something had gone wrong, but then he heard Myron Wagtail's suave voice. The students roared with glee and surged forwards to the stage.James caught Lily's eye and grinned. She looked very pretty in her robes: fine white silk that flowed flawlessly, and had been charmed with moving silver stars that travelled across the folds of her chiton. Her long red hair had been braided in a plait, held by a pin with a single crescent moon sticking out on top. He jerked his head towards the lonely refreshments area, and she followed him there."It's come along nicely, don't you think?" said James, gesturing at the Great Hall."Yeah," responded Lily, filling her glass of Butterbeer. "Your band isn't bad either, James.""Cheers." He drank from his cup. "I'm just glad it's over."Lily stepped back and surveyed him, smiling slightly. "Let me guess… John?"James sighed. He'd been mistaken for John twice that night – the other had been by Alice. "I'm Paul, actually. Sirius is John."He and Lily glanced over at the dance floor. James spotted Sirius dancing wildly with Marlene in his arms as The Weird Sisters played Holy Hydra. "But you have the glasses –""And Sirius has the sideburns," countered James, smirking. "I'm clean-shaven, see?""All right, fine," relented Lily, rolling her eyes. "Can you guess what I am, then, Paul?"James looked her up and down, stroking his clean-shaven chin thoughtfully. "Stars, the moon, a Greek dress… hard to get that wrong, isn't it? You're Artemis."Her smile told him he'd gotten that correct.They stood side-by-side, watching the others dance. Once or twice James cracked a silent joke, and they both laughed themselves silly. Soon, the Butterbeer turned into Firewhisky that he'd managed to snuggle in, and he shared it with Lily."We haven't fought in over a year now," remarked James suddenly, a while later. Lily looked up at him, surprised."Yeah," she smiled serenely. "D'you want to fight now?"James choked on his Firewhisky. "No thanks. I rather enjoy these moments alone with you, see.""Noted." James felt Lily reach out and squeeze his hand. "You're not so bad, Potter."James sincerely hoped that his palm wasn't sweating, because he sure felt like it was. His heart raced, and he whooped at the feeling of his hand clasped with Lily's.They joined their friends on the dance floor. He twirled Lily about, matching the upbeat tune that The Weird Sisters were playing. James and Sirius even danced together, roaring with laughter as they did so, and they both managed to pull Remus 'George Harrison' Lupin in to form a triplet. The Great Hall was less crowded now, and many of the students had left for bed or to take a night stroll out on the grounds.At a quarter till midnight, The Weird Sisters announced that they'd be playing a 'couple of Muggle songs', to which Lily squealed and dragged James off, presumably to dance. The Marauders shot him mischievous smirks that he only rolled his eyes at, and he lost sight of them in the crowd after that.The lights flickered, and Myron Wagtail stepped out in front, holding his microphone seductively. Professor Dumbledore and Professor Sprout danced tipsily off to the side, rotating slowly as Professor McGonagall cheered them on.To lead a better life...Lily guided him across the dance floor as though they were in a dream. James held on to her hand, his mind still fuzzy about the fact that this was actually happening, Lily Evans is willing to dance with me, she looks happy and I am happy…James waltzed with her, not caring that the others might be looking. At the moment, it was just him and Lily, no one else mattered, it was only her, her lemony scent, her dazzling smile and those enchanting emerald eyes that entranced him so…I want her everywhere…James agreed fully. He twirled Lily in his arms and pulled her close, their faces inches away from each other, and at that moment he felt the creature in his chest roar with approval. He felt as though every fibre of his being longed for her.Watching her eyes and hoping I'm there…Lily Evans's green eyes bore into his, a hard, blazing look on her face that told him that you're all right, after all, and I don't hate you, I never hated you, you stupid prat –Here, there, and everywhere.The song ended to raucous applause. James swore to himself right then and there – he'd always be there for the girl dancing in his arms, whether as friends or more, he'd always be there…James and Lily continued to sway slowly, their eyes glued to each other and smiles etched permanently on their faces. The candles above flickered dimly, and the last of the conjured bats vanished into smoke.The Weird Sisters started to play a slow, mellow tune, belonging neither to them or to the Beatles. It held few notes, but James felt as though it captured his emotions perfectly. He understood without having to think, he felt without reaching out, that this was right, this was so right… He pulled Lily closer, her warm body pressing up against his. He leaned down, smelling her sweet red hair, his hands tangling themselves in her locks, and he wished that this moment could last forever…"You're an excellent dancer," murmured Lily in his ear, leaning her head to his."You, too," said James softly.They moved back and forth slowly, tiny little steps that made the moment ever more delightful."We could elope," whispered James. "Just you and me…""Cheeky," breathed Lily, digging her hands into his hair, messing it up so that it was no longer neat and tidy. "And where would we go?"James nearly stepped on her foot.We. She hadn't rejected him. She hadn't recoiled, she hadn't scowled, and she hadn't said, in your dreams, Potter.I'm living a dream."I dunno," muttered James gruffly, revolving slowly. "I never thought I'd get this far…"Lily threw her head back and laughed. "Hogsmeade? After your match next week?""We, love," said James, resting his hands on her shoulders, "Can go anywhere you bloody well want."Lily smiled at him.Chapter 8! Or technically chapter 7, seeing as how I split the Plant the Truth chapters into two. In retrospect, I probably should have split this as well, as it's rather long.Disclaimer: The song I used here is Here, There and Everywhere by The Beatles! It's not my favourite song, that honour belongs to either In My Life or When I'm Sixty Four. I love The Beatles, their more popular songs are just so wholesome.Edit: I changed all the Marlons to Myrons. I do apologize, they're similar-sounding names and I didn't even realize at first. We can't have firsts-year Hufflepuffs becoming world-class rockstars, can we?Also, if any of you notice any sentences in which there aren't any periods, please let me know! I'll fix them right up. I noticed a few when I was reading through the already published chapter on the app, but I've since forgotten where they were and it's really a chore to read it all again. Read and Review, as always, and I hope you enjoy the chapter!

Chapter Eight: Quidditch WingThe next few days of November turned out to be some of the most memorable in Lily's life at Hogwarts, she came to realise. For one thing, it was Sirius's birthday on the 3rd, and she tossed him his present (a book on the greatest Muggle rock bands of the 20th century) as soon as she saw him at breakfast."Thanks, Lily," said Sirius, surprised. He ripped open the wrapping, squealed in a very unmanly-like manner once he saw the title, and flipped through the pages."I still can't believe you're eighteen," said Marlene, after pecking him on the cheek. "You act like a twelve-year-old."They had a good day after that. They all gathered in the Head's Tower after dinner, with Peter and Remus stumbling in a bit later laden with Firewhisky. Sirius roared with delight and passed around the drinks, taking two for himself."Here's to Padfoot, scion of House Black," said James sarcastically, holding up his bottle. "May he finally grow a pair and move out of my house, I'm starting to get real tired of him…""James, you wanker of a dog, you know you love me," mumbled Sirius, throwing an arm around him. "Here's to me!"The toast was repeated by the rest of their friends, and they laughed as Sirius declared his undying love for James.Another thing that made it quite memorable was that she'd finally had her girls' night with her previous dormmates, and they spent the time catching up on each others' lives.She didn't tell them about James. That was, she felt, much too private to share, and she wanted to keep it that way. Her moments of peace were few and far between, for, while nobody had heard what she and James had talked about at the Festival, they'd certainly seen them dance.Of course, it wasn't all bad. She and James hadn't touched on the subject just yet, but it was still there whenever they were alone in their common room – like some sort of erumpent waiting to explode.They'd been much more intimate as of late, with Lily reaching out and squeezing his hand whenever she felt stressed, and him reciprocating – but he always seemed to hold himself back, something that Lily didn't appreciate. She wanted to go out with him, she wanted to experience the feelings she'd felt that night at Hallow's Eve – and what better way than to snog the boy who'd caused them senseless?Sirius had apparently picked up on what had been going on, and once or twice she caught him eyeing her mischievously. She ignored him, as she always did, but it didn't stop her from having second thoughts – what if James wasn't interested anymore? What if, after all this time, she suddenly didn't seem to be worth all the trouble he'd put up with?Of course, she knew that that wasn't true. If anything, James was more enthusiastic these days, now that they'd finally gotten past the friends phase, but it raised more questions for her: what were they?More than friends, Lily had answered herself. More than friends… but not quite there yet.And when would they reach there?Lily sighed and stopped chewing her pork. All this thinking about James was bad for her.At that moment, the Head Boy in question sidled onto her bench, wearing a set of Quidditch robes, squeezing himself between Sirius and her; her heart skipped a beat, and her hands became clammy.James poked her gut. "Had a good day?"Lily flinched. That bastard knew she was ticklish down there. "Yes, thank you, Mister Tactless – you know how I feel about you doing that…""I know exactly how you feel," muttered James quietly, "Which is why I do it, of course."Lily resisted the urge to pinch him. I know exactly how you feel… was he doing this on purpose?"You haven't answered my question," said James, raising his finger threateningly."Don't do that," hissed Lily, forcing his hand down. "Fine, I had a good day. What does it matter?"James started piling his plate, seemingly satisfied with her answer. "It matters, love, because I care. Is that too much to ask?""No," said Lily haughtily, but she smiled all the same. "It'd help if you didn't bloody tickle me, though."James laughed through his mouthful of potatoes. "How else am I supposed to get a reaction out of you?"Lily bit back her tongue. He'd always known how to get a reaction out of her…Though, she recalled, it had certainly taken a long time to get the right reaction."Shouldn't you be practicing?" asked Lily, forgetting that James was wearing his Quidditch robes.James rolled his eyes. "What do you think I've been doing? I've been out on the pitch since noon.""Worked us to death, you have," said Marlene miffily from across them. "Mind you, I can't remember the last time my arse hasn't felt like it was moaning in pain…""Ah, cheer up, Marly," said James, flashing her a smirk that secretly made Lily's heart dance. "It'll be worth it once we win.""I think I value my health more, thanks," retorted Marlene."You know you love me," teased James good-naturedly. Marlene rolled her eyes and turned to talk to Alice.The rest of dinner passed quickly. James and Marlene were eating a lot more than usual, noted Lily. She'd already finished her food when they both swooped in, piling their plates once more, and eating as though they'd been Imperiused.At 9 o'clock she and James returned to the Head's Tower, with James talking about the Quidditch tactics he and Marlene had come up with. Lily always loved it when James talked about Quidditch. His hazel eyes always lit up and he spoke so enthusiastically it was hard not to share in his energy.Lily squeezed his hand and ruffled his hair and bid him good night, secretly disappointed that he hadn't kissed her once in all the time since Hallowe'en."You've got to eat, Prongs," said Sirius gently at the breakfast table, shoving a piece of toast under his nose. "You won't have any strength once you're up in the air.""I already ate yesterday, Pads," said James, feeling sick to the stomach. "I don't feel so good now.""Come on, Prongs, just a little bite," said Peter, offering him a bowl of Cheeri Owls.James pushed it all back, irritated. "I'm not hungry."Remus sighed. "Every year, Prongs. Do we have to do this every year? Just eat your sodding food."The others continued to persist, though James knew it was more to rile him up than to actually give him any food. One of the things that came with being a Marauder: everyone was always sarcastic."All right!" he said finally, taking Sirius's toast and dumping it into Peter's cereal. He stirred it with his spoon, and he ate it all in a single gulp."That's disgusting, James," said Remus absently from behind his newspaper. "Don't call us if you vomit over the Quidditch pitch."James pointedly ignored him."Anything interesting?" asked Peter, satisfied that James had eaten.Remus shook his head and folded his newspaper, turning to his plate of eggs. "Nope. Nothing about Theodore Plant or Voldemort. No attacks either, they've been keeping quiet.""We all know how that turned out last time," said James darkly.Remus shook his head again, an exasperated look on his face. "Prongs, the only thing I want you to think about is this match. You can't afford to be distracted by anything else.""Fine," said James, annoyed. He massaged his temples, trying to block out anything that wasn't a quaffle. "Have any of you seen Marlene? She's not here at breakfast.""She's probably already at the pitch," said Sirius vaguely. "Probably doesn't want to see you worked up, Prongs.""Right." James stood up, adjusting his Chaser's gloves. "I'll see you there, yeah?""Make sure you remind Regulus that his house is a pile of erumpent dung, all right James?" said Sirius, clapping him on the back."I'll try," responded James drily.He saw Lily and Alice leave the Great Hall. He hadn't talked to her all morning, except for their usual routine at the Head's Tower, and he so desperately wanted to…Convincing himself that he wasn't going to throw up on the pitch, he followed her out of the Great Hall.Lily walked down the path to the Quidditch Pitch with Alice. She hadn't seen Marlene at all that morning, who had gone straight to the locker rooms, Alice had informed her.And James… she was slightly disappointed that she hadn't seen him, either. He'd been in a hurry that morning at their Tower, and she was afraid that if she'd gone up to him during breakfast, he'd start panicking.That wasn't an overreaction. Lily remembered (quite fondly, now) how James had been before his first Quidditch match during their third year. He was just slightly more calm than a Hippogriff who'd been insulted.Alice babbled on about something or other, and Lily just agreed with whatever she said in-between her pauses of breath. They reached the gates to the pitch soon after.Even from outside, the stadium seemed to be very crowded. Flashes of green and crimson could be seen all around her; the colors for Slytherin and Gryffindor. She looked down at her measly red-and-orange scarf and sighed. She really could have done better in showing House pride.Just when she was about to enter with Alice, she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned around and nearly choked.The Gryffindor Captain himself was smiling down at her, looking very good in his Quidditch robes, his hair as messy as ever and his hazel eyes twinkling brightly."Hi," said Lily breathlessly. Alice sighed, gave her one last knowing look, and entered the pitch. She could have sworn she saw her smile."Hi," breathed James, his words forming mist in the cold November morning. "I just… er, wanted to see you before I played.""That's good," said Lily. She mentally kicked herself. That's good?"Right," said James, smiling happily. "Well… wish me luck, yeah?"She matched his smile. "Good luck, Potter."James stepped back, ruffling his hair. He saluted her and turned away.She glanced around her. Most of the students had already entered the pitch, they were very much alone now. Nobody was there to see her.Lily stood rooted to the spot, staring at his retreating back, her heart racing so quickly it nearly ached.For once, she decided to listen to her feelings. Lily smiled again, more to herself than to anyone else, and raced after James."Oi, Potter!"James had no time to respond, for as soon as he turned around, Lily grabbed the front of his robes and pulled him closer, and kissed him.She felt James relax, she felt his lips open as they made contact, and they both sunk deeper into each other's arms. She released his robes and curled her fingers around his face, gripping tighter, inhaling in his scent that smelled so like the forest, not wanting to break apart, wanting this moment to last forever –Potter, she thought giddily. His lips were soft.But James pulled back, out of breath and his face very red. His arms were still holding her waist.James took her face in his hands, a huge grin breaking out. "Merlin, Evans, I –"A flash of light blinded her suddenly, and she covered her eyes as a familiar voice sounded, "Way to go, Prongs!"Lily whipped around, finding the Marauders behind her, all with identical grins plastered on their faces. Remus was holding a large camera that was spewing clumps of purple smoke from the top."Sod off, you lot," said James, his hand finding Lily's and squeezing it. "When did you get here, anyway?""Followed you as soon as you left the Great Hall," answered Sirius cheekily. "We'll save it for the parties, eh?"Lily rolled her eyes at them and turned back to James. "Don't mind them, they're parasites…""I can still hear you, Evans!""Fuck off, Black," she said heartily. She stepped back from James, a playful smile on her lips. She could still feel his presence lingering on them…"I should better go," muttered James, his hand trailing up to his hair. His blush still hadn't faded completely. "See you in the stands, Lils.""Go smash them, Potter," murmured Lily, giving him one last smile. "Stay safe.""Where've you been?" demanded Marlene furiously, "The game's about to start!""Sorry, Marls," said James, switching out his square spectacles for a pair of Chaser's goggles. "Got a bit carried away with your best mate…""What?""Never mind," said James quickly, seizing his Nimbus: One. "Ready? Let's go, then."The Gryffindor Quidditch Team marched out on to the pitch. The stands up above cheered and booed deafeningly. On one end of the stadium, a sea of red and gold decorated the stands; on the other, it was a mass of green and silver.James licked his finger and pointed it high in the air, feeling for the wind. There was a slight breeze, and the temperature was as cold as ever… but there wasn't a cloud in sight, and the sun shined warmly on his face as he basked in the feel of the upcoming match.James stepped up to Madam Hooch, who had her foot over the ball crate and was waiting to release them."Shake hands," she said, and James grasped Lucinda Talkalot's hand briefly. "Mount your brooms, and on the whistle. Three… two… one!"Madam Hooch blew the whistle, James and the others kicked off hard from the ground, and in no time they were up in the air."Aaaand they're off!" cried the voice of the announcer, 5th-year Hufflepuff Julius Ainsley. "The Quaffle is taken by Salley, he immediately drops it to Johnson – he fumbles and it's taken by Hamish Greene, Greene's about to pass – intercepted by Salley –"James raced forwards, letting Harley and Paris Salley take hold of the Quaffle; he was all clear, and Salley hurled it towards his end; he lunged for it, grasping the Quaffle with the tips of his fingers; he streaked past Sigmund Dijkstra, the Slytherin Beater; taking aim, he pulled back, he shot, and he let fly –"GRYFFINDOR SCORE!" bellowed Julius. "Ten-nil to Gryffindor!"James pumped his fist into the air, scanning the stands, and there he saw her – Lily, sitting with all of their friends, cheering him on –He could still feel the taste of her lips on his. James grinned, turning back to the pitch."Slytherin in possession – bludger to the head by Hector Salley, that's gotta hurt – Quaffle taken by Talkalot, who passes to Greene – he speeds up to the goal post, can Bonham save – yes he can! Gryffindor in possession, is that the Wollongong Shimmy I see? Johnson to Potter, Potter speeds up – ouch, a bludger to his arm – Gryffindor still in possession, it's Salley, Salley all the way – he shoots –"James watched on with bated breath, but the Slytherin Keeper blocked it, earning a collective groan from one end of the stands. James shook his arm and grit his teeth."Pull back! Nice try, Paris, you'll get them next time…"The match went on. Gryffindor scored six more goals, three of which had been by James, while Charles Bonham had only let in a single Quaffle. James was quite pleased with the way this was going, if they kept this up they were sure to win…James passed the Quaffle over to Paris, who ducked under the bludger sent by Avery and dropped the ball to Harley. Harley passed up to James, who outflew his own set of bludgers and warped around Albina Aurelius, the Keeper – he tossed it through the hoop, though his aim had been a bit wonky –"Potter scores! Eighty-ten to Gryffindor!"James raced up into the air, feeling exhilarated, and he laughed like a madman – this was easy, they were sure to win –WHAM!Pain immediately erupted from the back of his head – he lurched forwards on his broom –THUMP!Another strike, this time to his side – he slipped off, his fingers gripping the handle – they couldn't hold his entire weight and he could feel his strength waning –"THAT WAS DELIBERATE!" bellowed McGonagall into the megaphone, pushing Julius out of the way. "ROLANDA, SURELY –""Have fun, Potter," spat Avery in his ear. James didn't respond, he couldn't respond, his head felt like it was about to explode, pain came at him from every direction, and his ribs felt as though they'd cracked...A hand wrapped around his waist, pulling him down gently; they descended down, Marlene gripping onto his robes tightly – James felt his feet touch the ground and he collapsed on the cold grass.He might have passed out for a moment, but then his eyes fluttered open – Madam Hooch had her wand pointed to him, looking worried – he saw Marlene and the rest of the team gathered around him in a circle."Are you all right, James?" asked Marlene.James sat on his elbows, lifting a hand up to touch the back of his head. "I guess – what happened?""Avery attacked you," said Hector Salley bitterly. "Right after you'd scored. He flew up and hit you with his bat. He's being suspended by Professor McGonagall."Marlene held out a hand, and James grasped it tightly. "Are you sure you're all right?""I'm fine, Mary," said James, shaking his head. It was clearing now, he could see his fingers again. "In the air, everyone, let's go."Marlene glanced at the others, who shrugged helplessly.James flew around the pitch in a dazed heap, oblivious to what the Gryffindor stands below looked like.Lily was beside herself, screeching and hurling insults at the Slytherins – but it was nothing compared to Sirius. He looked livid."I'm going to kill him," snarled Sirius, "Avery's going to pay…"Remus and Peter stayed silent behind him; if anything, they agreed.The match went on for ten more minutes, by which time Slytherin had steadily added to their number of goals."Eighty-sixty, to Gryffindor," said Julius half-heartedly, to groans from the Gryffindors. "Professor, Potter doesn't look so good, maybe he should rest – BLACK AND MCKINNON RACE UP, THEY'VE SEEN THE SNITCH!"His voice suddenly took on an energized and excited tone; and everyone momentarily forgot about James, who was still flying around in slow loops –"Come on, Marls," muttered Sirius, his eyes darting between his best mate and his girlfriend, "End it now…"Marlene sped forth, neck-to-neck with Regulus Black – the Snitch preceded them, darting around erratically – the two Seekers zoomed across the stadium, their arms stretched out –They dived. Marlene knocked Regulus's hand out of the way and her fingers grasped the tiny golden ball, and she pulled out of her dive just before she hit the ground – she raised her hand, holding the fluttering snitch, bellowing like a banshee."AND MCKINNON'S GOT THE SNITCH!" screamed Julius excitedly, "TWO-HUNDRED AND THIRTY TO SIXTY, GRYFFINDOR SLAM SLYTHERIN SIX FEET UNDER!"As soon as the Snitch had been caught, James spiralled to the ground and collapsed. Marlene immediately descended, her first-aid Quidditch training kicking in. She handed the Snitch to Madam Hooch and dismounted her broom, running up to James.Lily and Sirius had already jumped from the stands on to the pitch, wearing equal expressions of worry, and were hoisting James up on a conjured stretcher."Marls, can you get his legs?" grunted Sirius, his face very white. "We're taking him to the Hospital Wing."As a single unit, they marched off, carrying an unconscious Quidditch Captain.James woke up several hours later, lying on a comfortable bed surrounded by cards and boxes covered in wrapping paper. He raised his head groggily.He blinked, looking around. The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. The last rays of the sun shined out from behind the mountains. To his right, two people sat on chairs, leaning on each other, sleeping soundly.James slumped back on his bed, causing the various boxes to rattle and shake. His head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff wrapping of bandages.Sirius woke with a start. He and James stared at each other, and then he nudged Lily awake."Hullo, Prongs," said Sirius, standing up and stretching his limbs.James felt around his side; there were bandages there too, and there was the unmistakable feeling of having had his bones repaired quickly."What happened?""Cracked skull and broken ribs," said Madam Pomfrey, bustling over and holding a piece of parchment. "Some of your bones ledged themselves into your brain, Potter, but I managed to pull them back. Nothing to worry about now.""That sounds like something to worry about," muttered James, feeling the back of his head. "Did I fall or something? I don't remember –"Madam Pomfrey glanced at Sirius and Lily pointedly and left his bed."Well, you see, Prongs," started Sirius slowly. "Avery sort of… bashed your head in.""Ever the tactful one, Sirius," muttered Lily. She pulled her chair closer to his bed and sat down. "You were really badly hurt, James.""No kidding," said James sarcastically. "Did we win?""Marlene caught the snitch a few minutes after you were hit," said Sirius, a note of suppressed pride in his voice. "We won two-hundred and thirty to sixty."James let out a sigh of relief he didn't know he'd been holding. "Brilliant. Tell her that I actually love her now, will you, Padfoot?""I'll be sure to send her your messages," said Sirius pompously, standing up. His eyes wandered from James to Lily, and he winked at her. "I'll leave you two alone now. See you later."And he left. James reached out and found Lily's hand, and he massaged his thumb over it. She gripped it tightly.She had a white brassard on her left arm, noticed James. Stitched to it was a red cross, the symbol for St Mungo's."You volunteer for the Hospital Wing?" asked James, surprised."Yep," she said. "Been volunteering since fifth year. Looks good on my application."They sat in silence, fully enjoying the warm of their hands clasped together."I guess this means our Hogsmeade trip is cancelled," said James gloomily. "I was so looking forward to it…"Lily looked at him, an incredulous look on her face. "Honestly, James, I'm just glad you're OK. Forget Hogsmeade.""It was supposed to be our first date," lamented James. He froze suddenly, his eyes wide. "Er… you haven't changed your mind, have you? Would make things a whole lot more awkward…"Lily laughed and squeezed his hand. "No, I haven't changed my mind."James let out another sigh. "That's a relief."James leaned back in his pillows, watching the sun set and the sky darken. Madam Pomfrey bustled about in her office, humming absently. James found himself tapping along to her tune."What is this, by the way?" he asked Lily, after a short pause, gesturing around at all the cards and presents that surrounded him."They're gifts, of course," she sniffed, looking slightly irritated. "From your fans," she added to his questioning look."I have fans?" James asked incredulously. "Blimey – what'd they send?"He saw Lily's face in the corner of his eye and laughed. "Honestly, Lil, don't take it the wrong way."James reached for the box closest to him – it had been sent by one Marlon Abernathy. Sharing a smile with Lily, he opened the present.He found a light-blue box of black cookies. He didn't recognize the name of the brand, and he glanced quizzically up at Lily."They're Oreos," explained Lily, taking the box from his hands and ripping it open, "They're these sort of chocolate cookies with cream in them. Try one, they're really good."James took one from the box and nibbled it. It tasted pretty nice; he'd never had anything quite like this before. In no time the box of Oreos had been emptied by the both of them.James kept opening his presents – some of them were cards that Lily read aloud to him, sniggering – others were boxes of Valentine's Day chocolates ("It's not even Valentine's Day, they should try harder," he'd complained) that he was too afraid to open: he feared that they'd been injected with love potion.Finally, he came to the one labelled From the Marauders, with love. Looking at it suspiciously, he glanced at Lily, who sighed, and unwrapped the box with her wand.It was one of those photo boxes that James had seen his mother use to stash her precious photographs. James opened it cautiously and found a single square image.It was the picture that Remus had taken that morning before the Quidditch match. As he watched, Lily pulled him by his robes and kissed him; he saw his face change from confusion to alarm, and then to shock – before finally it set to an expression of blissful relaxation and he deepened the kiss.James and Lily smiled and closed the photo box.Finally got around to writing Jily. Read and Review, and I hope you enjoy the chapter!

A word to clarify everyone: I uploaded the wrong file by mistake, and just realized a few hours ago. I was very sleepy, and wasn't meant to update at all, but for some reason a part of me thought it was a good idea to stay up at night and click things withouth thinking. I'm very sorry, thank you to one of the reviews that pointed it out, chapter 10 is longer than the previous version and I'm somewhat satisfied by it now. Chapter 11 is still being written; I haven't finished it yet but I will soon. Again, I'm very sorry to everyone who was bothered by this.Chapter Nine: HogsmeadeNews that James Potter was going out with Lily Evans seemed to interest a great many people at Hogwarts. He did nothing to quell the rumours – they were, after all, true – but he didn't exactly advertise it either, something that Lily seemed to appreciate.James left the Hospital Wing after a single night, which was a new record, he mused to himself. Lily and Sirius escorted him down to breakfast, filling him in on what he'd missed at the usual afterparty (Remus had gotten himself so drunk he'd tried to kiss McGonagall after she'd told them off)."And what'd McGonagall say?" asked James, trying not to laugh as the image formed in his mind."Oh, you know," smirked Lily, "Something along the lines of Mr Lupin get a hold of yourself this instant or I will be giving you a detention.""She's lying, mate," whispered Sirius loudly as they turned into a first-floor corridor. "McGonagall sort of screamed at him. Moony hasn't looked the same since."They entered the Great Hall's double doors and sat themselves down at the Gryffindor table. Peter was comforting Remus, who was looking sulky and depressed (well, more so than usual, conceded James) as he stabbed his pancakes with surprising vindictiveness. James thought he saw McGonagall flash his friend a warning look when she strode past them, and he bit his tongue to keep from laughing as Remus hid behind his pile of food. All that day he seemed to be avoiding McGonagall's eye, and still looked quite embarrassed by that evening when the 7th-year Gryffindors sat by the fire in the Gryffindor common room, working on their Defence Against the Dark Arts essay. They were still on dragons, even though it was early November.The next ten minutes were filled by Lily's voice as she read her essay aloud to them, by which time James was starting to feel quite sleepy. His hand ached from writing so much and he had to ask Lily to repeat a few times."What was that, Lils?"Lily glared at him. "As I've said for the third time now, James, dragon chicks usually start to breathe fire at the age of six months…"And so the night went on. After they were finished with their dragon essays, Lily insisted they work on their Animation Charms, to which most of their little group groaned. She gave them all the evil eye, and James, resigned, took out his wand.A weeping table, a shivering window and a carpet that danced the Salsa later, James and Remus left the common room to patrol the school."I'm not entirely sure this will work, Pads," murmured Remus on Wednesday night, eyeing his fellow Marauder uneasily."Nonsense, Moony, of course this'll work," said Sirius impatiently, scanning the Marauder's Map.They stood just out of sight of the Slytherin common room, hiding under James's Invisibility Cloak, waiting for Avery to come walking by them. According to the Map, he was alone in Slughorn's office, and, in Sirius's opinion, very, very vulnerable. He wished Wormtail were there with them, but he was sleeping soundly in the dormitory, and Sirius wasn't one to wake people up."Remind me again what James said about this?" asked Remus.Sirius waved a hand idly. "He didn't say anything. I didn't tell him."Remus glared at him. "Padfoot, you take his Invisibility Cloak without his permission, and now you're telling me he doesn't know about this?""As far as I'm concerned, it's our Invisibility Cloak now," said Sirius."That's not the point!"Sirius glanced back at his friend, exasperated. "Moony, Avery's in detention for attempted murder. The murderee also happens to be James, in case you've forgotten…""I haven't forgotten," said Remus crossly. "I just think that fighting violence with violence isn't the best way to resolve this."He rolled his eyes. "Well, you can go back to the dormitory, then. I'm doing this – with or without your help."Remus glared at him some more. "Padfoot, I hate to do this, but I'm going to –""Take points?" said Sirius, smirking. "Put me in detention? I've heard it all before, Moony. I don't care. Now shut up, Avery's exiting Slughorn's office…"He grabbed Remus by the hand and pulled him forwards; they crossed the hallway and hid behind a broom cupboard. If he strained his ears hard enough, he could just make out Avery's loud footsteps.He appeared right then, hurrying out of the corridor. Sirius whispered, "Mischief managed!" and the Map became blank; he stuffed it inside his robes and turned to Remus."Are you doing this or not?"Remus sighed resignedly and pulled out a box of Dungbombs. "James is going to kill us.""Nevermind James, McGonagall will have both of our heads…"They crept through the dark stone floors of the dungeon, under the cover of the Invisibility Cloak. Right as Avery rounded the corner, Sirius struck; lobbing Remus's Dungbombs straight at Avery's exposed back.The smell was something in between the world's largest supply of Stinksap and Severus Snape's greasy hair in the morning; it was nothing strange to Sirius, but all the same, he didn't enjoy it in the slightest. Avery yelped, turning around quickly and clawing at his robes, but before his voice could rise to a scream, Remus shot a silent "Silencio!" at him.Avery opened his mouth and closed it repeatedly, looking very much like a fish out of water. His wild movements, coupled by the smell of Dungbombs, caused him to trip over his robes and crash to the ground. Sirius and Remus took off the Invisibility Cloak, grim smiles on their faces, towering over Avery."I'd say a tribute to Prongs is fitting, don't you think?" said Sirius, already knowing what spell to curse him with."I still don't agree with violence," said Remus.Together, they pointed their wands at the cowering Slytherin, and exclaimed, "Anteoculatia!"Avery's eyes widened as his head became suddenly heavy; two pairs of antlers sprouted right above his ears, growing quickly as he uttered silent screams. They lengthened and widened, eventually outgrowing even those of Prongs's, and he lay on the ground, unable to move his head."How do you feel now, Moony?" asked Sirius."A bit better," admitted Remus, his wand still pointed at Avery. "I think if we stuck around a little longer, I'd be feeling golden… for the purpose of revenge, of course…""Spoken like a true Marauder," said Sirius, and he grinned broadly as both boys turned their full attention to Avery, who now resembled an overgrown faun."Did you lot have anything to do with the fact that Avery's in the hospital wing?" asked James at breakfast the next morning, eyeing the Marauders suspiciously. "Madam Pomfrey says he looks, and I quote, nothing less than a slimy, oozing gigantic slug with two pairs of overgrown antlers."Sirius shrugged easily, which further confirmed James's suspicions. "Who knows? He can't remember what happened, at least that's what I heard from the Slytherins…"Lily glared at him. "Sirius, you know that Memory Charms are forbidden. I'm going to have to take points –""Don't bother," interrupted Remus, not quite meeting her eyes. "There's no way of proving that it was us – I mean," he added hastily, as Lily scowled dangerously at him, "that it was Sirius."James watched his friends amusedly, trying not to laugh as the image of a stag-slug hybrid formed in his mind. "You're right, Moony, there isn't. In fact, I'd like to thank the people that did this – I mean, they've done us all a huge favour. I think a round of Firewhisky is in order… if, hypothetically, we find them, of course…""James!" admonished Lily, as Remus and Sirius laughed. "Don't tell me that you're going to let them get away with this!""Personally, love, I don't see the problem," said James, shooting her a smile. "I mean, he did bash my head in with a Beater's club.""But –"James silenced her with a kiss. Lily, surprised, tried to look cross, but when he pulled away she appeared quite flustered."Fine," said Lily resignedly, turning to her morning cereal. "I guess, due to the special circumstances, I'll let this slip…""There we go," said James proudly.On Friday morning, the Gryffindors found a surprise waiting for them pinned to the noticeboards: tomorrow on Saturday would be a Hogsmeade weekend."Finally," said Sirius as he read the notice from over Peter's head, "I thought they'd forgotten, we usually get them much earlier…"The rest of the day passed quickly. James and Sirius exploded their cauldron during that morning's potion's lesson, causing Professor Slughorn to take 10 points off of Gryffindor. They more than made up for it by receiving full marks on their Transfiguration quiz after, finding it ridiculously easy, though James kept that information to himself.Lily, meanwhile, was improving drastically in the subject, now that James had taken to tutoring her nearly nightly. She had, however, in a move James thought rather unfair, firmly insisted on separating their personal relationship from their school and work relationships, saying that it would get in the way and overcomplicate everything."Just get on with it, James," she said impatiently that evening after dinner, "I still don't understand this bit, or so help me…""Things would be going a lot faster if you'd just start calling me Professor, like I asked you to," said James vaguely.Lily responded by smacking him with her textbook.By the time they were finished, however, they did not go to bed, though he desperately wanted to, but opened their books and began working on their Herbology essays. Rather than leave it for the weekend, they'd decided on finishing it all together. The ridiculous amount of work that they were tasked with had finally caught up to them, and though he knew that it was partially his fault for holding them back during their long tutoring sessions, Lily didn't hold it against him. They then dashed off answers to Hedith's questions on Lethifolds, put together an explanation as to why even numbers were considered horrible luck in their Arithmancy paper, and finally threw down their quills, exhausted."I'm going to bed," yawned Lily. "Come on then, we need to sleep…""Can't," said James, rubbing his eyes. "I've still got an essay for Binns that I haven't turned in.""All right," she murmured. "Don't stay up too late, James…"She kissed him on the cheek and left for her room. James smiled to himself and extricated a crumpled roll of parchment from his bag.Merlin, this was turning out to be much more than what he bargained for. He'd thought that he'd be able to balance his life between being Quidditch Captain and Head Boy, but now – he realized that no sane person would be able to do that. Maybe he should leave it for tomorrow. It was the weekend, after all, but he didn't want to ruin a perfectly good day after being out at Hogsmeade. Relaxation had become a foreign concept to him.Time passed slowly as he looked over his essay. His head began to ache, though he wasn't sure if it was because of the lack of sleep or because Binns had set them a ridiculously hard topic. James listened to the crackling sound of the dying embers in the fireplace for a while. It reminded him of his bed, waiting longingly for him…He shook his head, realizing that he'd zoned out. At last, he began to write his essay.He was finding it very difficult to write about 'a detailed description on the history of dragon-sighting, and how it connects to the goblin rebellions of the fifteenth century', and the textbook Binns had recommended to him was of no help at all. Soon his hand was sore, though he hadn't written much. He looked up now and again to stare out the window; it had begun snowing that morning, something that he was not looking forward to braving at Hogsmeade. Everything seemed to get louder at that instant: his own heartbeat, beating rhythmically with the sound of the crackling fireplace; the wind blowing against the tower, making it sound as though the Bloody Baron was moaning outside…He shook his head again.… Vulhook the Vicious tried to convince his goblin tribe, Slordict, to take action against the dragons that were rampaging their land, but the chieftain was too afraid, because that would incite a war with the Wizarding community due to his standing –The fireplace finally darkened, and James had to light it with his wand. The common room was feeling unusually cold. He gazed at his textbook, trying to find what the chieftain's stupid standing with the Ministry was. He'd just read over it; why was finding it so difficult now?James closed his eyes. Perhaps Lily was right, and he needed to sleep. He wasn't doing himself any favours staying up like this…No, he thought. Just get this finished, then you'll go to sleep.He opened his eyes and scanned through the book once more; at last, he found it. The Chieftain, Valerook, had offended humans by seizing their land and claiming it as the goblins'; in doing so, he'd released the dragons, who protected the humans…James wrote a couple of lines about the goblin's land, trying to stretch out the words so that he would reach the expected length. He read over what he'd written, and in his mind he saw Lily laughing; it was dreadful.He closed his eyes again, trying to envision himself as Vulhook the Vicious convincing his chieftain to fight… he remembered something about how mermaids had come to help him…The clock to his right said that it was nearing one in the morning, he really should get to sleep…One, he thought, slowly swaying on the spot. Only one mermaid had come to help him…The background sounds were starting to fade. Even the wind had slowed to a slight breeze. He closed his eyes, giving up on his textbook as all around him the noises that had kept him awake slowly turned into one, clinking sound…He was standing on the black floor of a well-furnished manor house, its silver chandeliers swinging and clinking purposely overhead, covering the room in dim, flickering light… murky, black-hooded shapes moved about, forming a sort of circle surrounding him and one other thing. He had a body, transparent and luminescent, and he moved freely, but the shapes took no notice; he was invisible to them. He looked to his side and found a… a statue? James couldn't tell. It lay motionless and kneeling on the ground, as if it was bowing to something or someone…"They are here, my Lord," said one of the figures, her voice harsh and feminine. "Those that I spoke of to you… I have brought them to see…""Very good," said another voice in front of him, this one high and cold. "They shall witness… and they shall decide…"James froze. He didn't know why, but the second voice sounded… he couldn't put the right words.Then, the statue in the middle screamed; with a jolt that nearly woke him up, he realized that it was not a statue, but a man – a wave of emotion passed over him, and through his dream James winced; it was as though he could feel the pain the screaming man was going through…"No more, please no more…"The second voice laughed. It was cold and emotionless; without mirth. It was a laugh of pure malice, and James knew somehow that it had been practiced and perfected, as though the speaker didn't understand human emotion, and was only mimicking…He bent down to help the man, but his hands passed right through. He glanced down at his feet and found that he was floating. There was nothing he could do but watch…No more, thought James desperately. Please wake me… Lily or Sirius or anybody… "How long, Theodore?" hissed the cold voice. "How long will your filthy blood endure the magic of Lord Voldemort?""Kill me, please just kill me…""Eventually, I shall," said the voice of Lord Voldemort. "Before death takes you, however, I have plans for you… you, Theodore, shall be the beacon that shines in the darkness of the wizarding world."The figures surrounding them nodded and murmured excitedly. The man in the middle raised his head. His face was bloody and gaunt, and through his curtain of silver hair, James could see his bright green eyes were wet with tears, looking like broken glass…Voldemort stepped forwards and lowered his wand. The man screamed and screamed, and the dream faded –The blazing white common room stung and watered his eyes as he opened them quickly. He gave a slight yelp and jumped on the couch; he hit his knee on the table and cursed.His heart was beating a million times a second. That dream… he had just witnessed Voldemort torture and possibly kill a man…In the dream, a voice had said that they had 'brought him', whatever that meant. The fact that he had been there was not random. He had been chosen.He massaged his temples, trying to make sense of what he had just seen. He was being targeted; of that much, he was at least certain. The reason why, he had no idea…"James?"A voice, warm and gentle, made him jump again. He glanced up, towards the stairs that led to the Heads' dorms, and found a blurry redhead leaning against the railing, wearing pyjamas and slippers.He let out a sigh of relief. "Lily. What's wrong?"She made her way down the stairs, looking ever-more angelic as she neared him. His glasses had slipped off; he felt around the sofa and put them on."I was going to ask you the same thing," murmured Lily, sitting down next to him. "Is everything all right? I heard noises.""It was nothing," James assured her, "What time is it, anyway?""It's three in the morning, but don't change the subject." She narrowed her eyes at him. "What's going on?""I told you, it's nothing," said James again. "Just a nightmare, that's all.""A nightmare?" asked Lily, her voice curious, "Do you want to talk about it?"She took his hand in hers hesitantly. Lately, that had been a sign of reassurance for them both; the feel of her warm palms relaxed him somewhat, and he felt some of the weight in his chest ease…He looked at her for a moment, trying to decide whether or not to convey his thoughts to her. He recalled seeing Voldemort and some of his followers. He knew that was important, but the memory of the dream was already murky…James looked at her again. He didn't want to worry her. After all, they were just dreams, and not visions or anything…"No, not really," he decided. "Maybe later, Lils.""James, you know you can tell me," said Lily gently.He clasped her palm with both of his hands, trying to convey to her that he was all right. "I know. I just don't want you worrying."Or maybe I don't want myself worrying.She arched an eyebrow. "You wake up from a nightmare looking as though you took a dip in the black lake, and you tell me not to worry?"For a moment, he had no idea what she was talking about, but then he looked down at his clothes; he had taken off his robes earlier, leaving him clad in just a plain white t-shirt. He hadn't noticed it before, but he was caked in sweat."Good point." James laughed shakily, trying to push the embarrassment out of his mind. "Look, let's just enjoy ourselves today. We're going to Hogsmeade, aren't we?"Lily let go of his hand and eyed him stonily. "James Potter, if something's bothering you, I want you to tell me. A relationship is built on trust. We won't be getting anywhere if we keep secrets from each other."And James felt an immense pang of guilt at those words. His life flashed before his eyes; what if Lily, once he'd gotten around to telling her… what if she didn't take to his Animagus form well? What if she didn't take to any of his secrets well?Well, he thought, silence and secrecy are old friends of mine…But James tried for a smile. "I know, Lily. I just need some time to process this by myself, all right?"Lily nodded in a final sort of way. "Just tell me. I want to know. Maybe I can help.""I will," promised James. They both stood up.Lily looked him up and down, perhaps noticing how baggy his eyes were and how his hair was messier than usual. He certainly felt like it was."Now go to sleep, or I'll be forced to stay in the castle with you and miss out on Hogsmeade.""You'd do that for me?" teased James.Lily stood on her toes and kissed him. "Maybe. I'll see you later, after you've gotten a good night's sleep. Good morning, James."She guided him to his room and left him there. James smiled briefly to himself before his thoughts strayed back to his dream. The sound of Voldemort's voice was already fading…He got down to breakfast with Lily after a less-than-stellar night's sleep, wearing his usual winter clothes, as well as a black cloak fastened around his shoulders and a red-and-gold Gryffindor scarf wrapped around his neck. He sat down next to Peter, who was doing that morning's edition of the Daily Prophet's crossword."James, who's the unkillable giant?" asked Peter as soon as he finished grabbing his toast.James started. "I'm sorry, what was that, Wormy?""The unkillable giant," inquired Peter, gesturing at his crossword. James squinted at it."Er, I dunno, Pete," admitted James. "I've never been good at history. Maybe Alcyoneus?"Peter bent down to write the word. "Alcyoneus. That'll be A-L-S-Y –""A-L-C-Y," corrected James. "You know, that bloke with the club.""Hey, that fits!" Peter scribbled the letters. "Thanks, Prongs.""No problem," said James. He spent the rest of breakfast helping Peter with the crossword, which they finished in record time, and when the clock struck ten o'clock the students in the Great Hall all got up and shuffled towards the oak front doors.Filch was standing there as usual, checking off the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade. When he reached James and the rest of the Gryffindors, he gave them all a nasty look and reluctantly let them pass.The walk into Hogsmeade was cold and uncomfortable. James pulled his cloak tighter around his body, trying to keep himself warm. He cursed himself silently as they followed the path; he'd forgotten to wear gloves, and now he was paying the price. It got better once he reached the village; the place was bustling with so many students that the cold was slightly more bearable.His mind strayed to thoughts about his earlier nightmare as he was pulled by Lily through the crowd. He could barely recall anything about it now, just that Voldemort had been there. That cold, high voice terrified him. James had heard it say something to the man… something about shining a light?Lily pulled him into Honeydukes, where they found the place crowded as usual. James let out a sigh of relief as the warm, toffee-scented air enveloped him. His hands no longer felt as though they were about to fall off.While Lily and Alice busied themselves with Sugar Quills and Drinkable Ink, James and the rest of the group went further back into the store, where the real sweets were. He treated himself to a pound of Honeydukes' Best. He decided to send his dad a whole jar of Cockroach Clusters as a joke, to which Sirius laughed in agreement. His eyes landed on a particular brand of treacle fudge that Lily had once said she liked during one of their patrols.Soon, they all trudged up High Street, carrying bulging bags of candy and chocolate. They hurried into Zonko's, with James pulling a reluctant Lily behind him; he renewed his supply of Dungbombs and fireworks."Shall we go to Three Broomsticks, then?" asked Alice. "I'm meeting someone there.""Who?" asked Peter curiously.Alice only smiled. "You'll see."They bundled their scarves back over their faces and James stuffed his hands into his pockets. Zonko's was like dragon-breath compared to the temperature outside. The weather was getting worse and worse, and the falling sleet didn't seem to be stopping any time soon. The street was still crowded, though less so, now that some of the students had admitted defeat against the cold. James and the others staggered into the Three Broomsticks.It was not as crowded as James usually remembered. There were few students, which he found quite odd. There were queer people about; many wore robes that hooded and disguised them. Off to the corner, he saw a witch sit up straighter as the door jingled; she was wearing a cloak that appeared to be many sizes too big for her. He had no time to think on that, though; Alice immediately made a beeline for one of the tables, where a lone figure was sat sipping a bottle of Butterbeer."Frank!"The man started and squinted in their direction. When he spotted Alice, a huge smile appeared on his face and he jumped up to hug her. James and the others moved through the crowd to get to the couple."Longbottom," said James once they'd reached them, extending his hand."Potter," said Frank, smiling good-naturedly, and he shook his hand. "I hear you're taking after me. Head Boy! Decided to settle down in your old age, eh?""Fat chance," laughed James, pulling up a chair for Lily. They all sat down at the table and Madam Rosmerta hurried over to take their orders. Sirius immediately started to talk to her, and Marlene rolled her eyes."So, how've you been, Frank?" asked James. He set his bags down near his feet."Oh you know," said Frank airily, "What with Auror training and all that, I haven't had much free time. Still managed to convince Mad-Eye to give me a few days off, though.""Mad-Eye Moody?" asked Remus interestedly. "He's your boss?""Yep," said Frank, popping the 'p'. "Complete nutter, I tell you. Doubt he could settle down like you, James."Alice leaned over and whispered something in Frank's ear. His face immediately lit up in surprise, and he turned back to him and Lily."You two are going out?""Frank!" admonished Alice, hitting his shoulder lightly. "I didn't tell you so that you could bombard them with questions!""Yes, but even so…" Frank smiled proudly at James. "Potter, I must congratulate you. Never thought I'd see the day.""Thanks," muttered James, and he leaned back and snaked an arm around Lily. "Honestly, neither did I.""It was bound to happen eventually," said Lily teasingly. She leaned her head on his shoulder.At that moment, Madam Rosmerta and Sirius returned to their table, carrying a handful of Butterbeers. James accepted his with a wink from Rosmerta, who eyed him and Lily knowingly."Well, here's to Gryffindor," said Frank lazily, holding up his second bottle. "And to James and Lily, I suppose.""Hear, hear!" said the table, clinking their bottles together.The atmosphere was light and cheerful; everybody was happy to see Frank again. He'd aided the Marauders a number of times in their ways of pranking and mischief-making, and he didn't stop even when he was made Head Boy. He announced proudly that James was indeed taking after him, and called another round of drinks once they'd emptied their bottles.James drowned out the others and snuggled up to Lily, fully appreciating the fact that she was here with him, as his date and girlfriend. Here they were, enjoying Butterbeer with a couple of old friends, and they had eyes for only each other…So why did he get the feeling that something was going to go horribly wrong?His thoughts drifted off to his nightmare. The memory was dim and he couldn't remember what Voldemort sounded like, much less what he had been talking about. He tried to shake the feeling off; he shouldn't be feeling like this, he should be enjoying himself…"What's on your mind?" asked Lily, her face morphing into a worried expression as she looked up at him.Despite his thoughts, he smiled exasperatedly. "How do you do that? You always know when something's bothering me."Lily found his hand and squeezed it. "Your face scrunches up and you get this cute look. And also, because I know you."James wanted to say, and you like me anyway?Instead, he answered her. "Just thinking about this morning, before you woke me up…""Is it the nightmare?" asked Lily, her voice laced with alarm, and she sat up. "James, you're telling me now. If something's bothering you –""It's fine," James cut her off. "I'm just getting this weird feeling…""Go on," urged Lily."Like something's going to happen," said James slowly. "Something dangerous.""Dangerous?" asked Lily incredulously. "It can't be – him?"James wondered how she'd come to that conclusion so quickly. "Maybe. I don't know. Then again, perhaps it's nothing, and I'm just worrying for naught…""You think we should go back to school?" asked Lily, drumming her fingers along his hand nervously. "If you've got a feeling – we could shut the place down, tell everybody to go back.""I –""Guys." Alice cut him off swiftly, a little smile spread across her lips. "I hate to burst you out of your little world, but Frank needs you two to be quiet. He's going to take a call.""Sure," said Lily, grinning sheepishly. "Sorry, Frank.""Don't worry about it," said Frank, winking at James. "This'll just take a moment…"He took a small black piece of metal from under his coat and put it up to his ear. "Mad-Eye? It's Frank."James watched him, holding his breath as Frank blanched."Are – are you sure?" said Frank. The rest of the table was very quiet, and the atmosphere in the Three Broomsticks seemed to mimic them.A tiny voice spoke from the black piece of metal. Frank's face fell. James closed his eyes, gripping Lily's hand for reassurance."I – yes, of course I will," said Frank, his tone now serious and his expression hard. "Of course. I'll try to get everyone to safety."He folded his instrument and stuffed it back in his coat. He stared around the table, his jaw set and looking older than he was."Well?" said James, breaking the silence.His stomach dropped as Frank looked at him, his eyes uncharacteristically harsh. "Mad-Eye's received intel from one of his spies. You-Know-Who's coming here, to Hogsmeade."It was as though a bomb had been dropped in the middle of the pub. Everyone had heard them, and now they were staring fearfully at each other, unable to say anything. And then, from the corner of the room, a harsh and feminine voice spoke."Very good, Longbottom." Her cloak fell away, revealing a pale, beautiful face with eyes that suggested she was insane. "The Dark Lord is, indeed, coming."

Chapter Ten: The Beacon is LitThe two parties regarded each other coldly. No one in the pub moved a muscle. Even Rosmerta, who had been busy wiping her glasses, had stopped to stare at them.Then Sirius inhaled sharply. "Bellatrix."The woman turned to look at him. She might have smiled, but to Lily it looked more like a leer."Hello, little cousin," said the woman, inclining her head. James's grip on her hand went slack. "I hear Aunt Walburga blasted you off of the family tree. Is that true?"Sirius snarled. "Whereas I hear you've been torturing Muggles whenever you're not brooding with Rodolphus."Bellatrix shrugged easily. "I won't deny it. I've been busy keeping the wizarding world pure." She broke from his gaze and surveyed the rest of their group, an ugly smile pasting itself on her thin lips. "Something, dear cousin, that you haven't been doing, I'm afraid. The company you keep these days… First, blood traitors, and now you've sunk so low as to befriend Mudbloods."She spat the word so easily it almost hurt to hear. Lily flinched; something she'd been accustomed to doing whenever she heard the word. Sirius surged forwards, a furious look on his face, but Frank stepped in between them before he could get any closer."ENOUGH!" roared Frank, pointing his wand at Bellatrix. "Bellatrix Black, you're under arrest for crimes against humanity. Turn around slowly, and raise your wand above your head."Bellatrix's smile widened.She raised her wand, high above her head, and then flicked it downwards so quickly Lily could barely see it; quite a few people in the pub screamed and backed away, scramming towards the door. A jet of red light streaked from her wand towards Frank –Alice whipped her wand in front of him and deflected the curse, sending it bouncing around the pub. It set fire to various spots, and soon the wooden walls of the Three Broomsticks were alight with flame…"Oh no you don't!" screeched Rosmerta angrily from behind her bar, and she took out her wand, a livid look on her face, "Take this outside!"But neither Bellatrix nor Frank heard her; they furiously shot spells at each other, lifting tables and chairs to hide behind. All around them, people screamed, scramming towards the door; flashes of bright light filled the small pub, blinding Lily. Even as she rushed forwards to help, Bellatrix arced her wand across her head like she was cracking a whip, and from it emanated a force so powerful that the windows shattered and they all flew back, slamming into the walls.Lily's eyes fluttered open, trying to ignore the blinking stars, but Bellatrix had turned and vanished in a puff of black smoke. Cracks were heard all around her, outside; she wasn't sure if it was the pub breaking down or something else…"Where's she gone?" snarled Sirius, staggering up to his feet. His nose was bloody and there were a few cuts on his arms from where the glass had sliced him."She flew off," murmured James, sitting against the wall and massaging his temples.Lily only half-heard what they were talking about; she strained her ears to listen to what was going on outside. Dark figures moved about, more cracks were sounding, and with a sudden feeling of dread, she realized what the others had not: they were being surrounded."Stay quiet!" she hissed, and the others immediately heeded her. "There are people outside, I think they're Death Eaters…"Frank crouched up, dusting his robes. He looked relatively unscathed, but there was a nasty-looking bruise on his wrist. "The Aurors aren't coming any time soon. We're all that's left to defend.""We can do this," said Peter determinedly. "I bet they think Bellatrix knocked us out. If we can surprise them…"He trailed off, but the others understood. Lily scanned her surroundings; the pub was destroyed, and she had no idea if the people had made it out… with a pang, she realized that that was her responsibility as Head Girl, to keep everyone else safe."Don't go inside," said a muffled voice from just outside the wall, deep and drawling. "We destroy the building, nothing else."Her friends made alarmed moves; they were gearing up to protect the pub, and Lily squared her shoulders as she readied her wand."We've got to attack first," she said, "It's like Peter said, they still don't know about us –""Are you mad?" said Sirius incredulously. "They'll kill us on the spot if we so much as peek our heads!""What choice have we got?" snapped Lily. "Either way, we're still going to be fighting Death Eaters.""They outnumber us," said James, glaring at Sirius. "If we don't strike first –""On three," said the drawling voice. "One –""Send them anything!" hissed Lily. "Brace yourselves –""– two –""It's no use," said Sirius bitterly. "All right –"In the space between the seconds, Lily saw her friends press their shoulders against the wall, their wands pointed straight up, determined looks on their faces."– three –""NOW!" bellowed Lily.Before any spells could come their way, Lily and the others crowded around the broken windows, and eight different voices bellowed,"STUPEFY!" Eight curses streaked off from their wands at the nearest Death Eaters; some ricocheted off their bodies and took down more than one, and the Death Eaters, momentarily surprised, shouted unintelligibly –"OUT!" roared Frank, gesturing towards the door. "WE NEED TO GET OUT!"They sprinted out the door, casting random curses in all directions; the Death Eaters instantly surged towards them, their masked faces staring menacingly; Lily felt James grab her robes and drag her forwards. Spells of different colours bounced harmlessly around them, and she realized that Sirius and Remus had their wands raised above their heads, casting a variety of shield charms –They crossed the street; heading for a line of shops. The village was weirdly deserted, but then Lily saw figures peeking through the windows; at least the civilians had had the sense to hide. They were nearing Zonko's, if they could get behind the building they'd at least have some cover from the Death Eaters behind them –"CONFRINGO!" roared a voice behind them.With a gasp of horror, Lily turned her head; she saw a fiery curse make its way through the air towards them; it made contact with the shield and instantly fire engulfed them, blasting their protective enchantments to smithereens –A hand pulled her out of the way before the curse could harm her; James pushed her forwards, waving his wand in a sweeping motion, extinguishing the flames that came at them. They'd been separated from the main group, it was just her and James now, and she seized a fistful of his robes and dragged him with her before he could engage –Spells shot at them, but Lily ducked and they cratered the buildings in front of her; they were behind Zonko's, but there was no time to regroup and form a plan with her friends; they rushed towards an alleyway, finding the way ahead clear and she saw Remus and Peter sprint past them; something heavy struck her on her legs, but she merely kicked and ignored it; she heard James shout, "Impedimenta!" and there was a yelp behind her, and someone shouted –They had entered the alley with another Death Eater, and Lily made quick work of him, disarming him and then slamming him to the wall; she waved her wand wildly over the two buildings towering over them, and the entrance to the alley closed suddenly as the bricks formed a sort of barrier, blocking the rest of the Death Eaters out; she and James rushed forwards, she could see flickering light at the end of the alleyway as sleet fell hard from the sky –They ducked past more curses as the barrier behind them gave way; they rounded a corner just before the spells could hit them, and they ran, their hands clasped so tightly it was starting to hurt; the houses and shops were a blur as they streaked past, sending spells and curses behind them; she didn't see her spells hit the Death Eaters, but the grunts and shouts told her more than enough –She and James hadn't looked where they were going; she slammed into a body and they both toppled to the ground. In an instant, they were up, their wands pointed forwards –"Prongs?" said Sirius incredulously. "And Lily! Thank Merlin!"Lily lowered her wand shakily, a relieved smile finding its way on to her lips. "Where are the others?""We thought they were with you!" said Marlene anxiously. "After that curse hit us, we went off on our own, we didn't see anyone else…"Lily glanced behind her. For the moment, they were all clear, but if she remembered correctly, there had been a dozen Death Eaters waiting for them outside the pub. Hogsmeade was crawling with them, and if she didn't think of something fast, they were doomed."We need to stick together," said Lily, not wanting to think of what might have happened to their friends. "Find the others fast, and then get out of the village.""That simple, huh?" said Sirius weakly.They all laughed, breaking the solemn mood; it felt good, watching her best friends be happy and confident in moments like these…Suddenly, a voice from off to their side bellowed, "OVER HERE! I heard voices!"Without a word, all four of them snuck past, darting along before the Death Eaters could see them. They ran as quickly as they could, passing more shops and houses along the way; she caught glimpses of people peeking through their windows, but she ignored them, she ran past them, following James and Sirius as they entered a forest –"Where are we going?" panted Sirius.Lily and Marlene grinded to a halt. "We were following you!"Sirius cursed. Lily didn't recognize the place they were in; obviously, they were still on Hogsmeade grounds, but she didn't recall ever going through these thickets of wood. Trees surrounded them, blocking the setting sun. Snow fell hard and cold on her eyes, but it masked any sound that they might have made."The Shrieking Shack isn't far off," said James suddenly. "We could use the high ground, try to see what's happening.""It's better than nothing," said Marlene heavily. Distant shouts echoed behind them and she glanced back. "We should go now, we don't want to stay in one place for too long…"The four of them waded through the woods quickly, trying not to make a sound. No birds chirped overhead, making Lily feel lonely and small. She doubted whether anything lived here, in this depressing grove.Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, they reached the edge of the forest, where the Shrieking Shack stood high on a snowy hill, looking even more unwelcome. Lily shuddered; she remembered suddenly that this was the place Remus went to whenever he transformed."We need to get a message to Dumbledore," breathed James. "There's a chance they don't even know what's happening here.""And how do we do that?" said Marlene, rolling her eyes. "Unless you can conjure an owl –"But they had been careless, somehow, they had been found; bright curses of many colors shot through the trees towards them. Lily whipped her wand out and held it steady, casting a shield; it shook and cracked, and she nearly let it go –"And here we was thinking that we's lost you forever," said a wheezy voice, its source emerging from the forest. Many others followed him. "A group of four make large footprints, eh?"Lily cursed silently; she'd been stupid enough to think that the falling snow would cover their tracks. What looked like half a dozen Death Eaters stepped out to surround them. She felt James and the others close in, their backs to each other, facing different directions."Throw down your wands," said another, drawling voice; Lily recognized him as the one who had spoken earlier outside the Three Broomsticks. "The Dark Lord wishes to speak to you. He believes that you are worthy of joining our cause –""Yeah, that's exactly why you tried to kill us earlier," snarled James beside her. "You and your Dark Lord can shove off."Lily saw the Death Eater turn his head to regard him. "You are in no position to refuse, Potter. You are outnumbered, and if you don't agree with our offer –" the Death Eater twirled his wand carelessly, "well, I'm afraid even the Dark Lord will understand…"She saw no way out of this; the Death Eaters had their wands pointed at them, there was no escaping. Even if they did manage to beat them in a frontal duel, there were still six other Death Eaters to worry about, not to mention Bellatrix Black and Voldemort."Just hold on…" muttered James, so quietly Lily almost didn't hear him. "We'll think of something…"Then, multiple voices from the forest cried, "STUPEFY!"The Death Eater in front of her fell face first to the ground. More spells shot out of the trees, finding the Death Eaters as they suddenly turned, startled – four figures stepped out from the forest, their wands a blur of of colour and movement as they cursed and hexed and jinxed at whatever moved –Lily wasted no time. She whipped her wand high above her head, suddenly energetic; she shot spell after spell, and the Death Eaters, in their panic and disorder, tried to fight back –But it was now six against eight, and the Death Eaters were backing away; Lily surged forwards, her friends behind her, her thoughts empty but for the notion of turning the Death Eaters into one gigantic pile of Erumpent dung –Then they vanished in a wisp of smoke, flying high above the trees. Sirius bellowed angrily, "COWARDS!", a cry that was repeated by many of her friends as they shot whatever spells they could think of, but they all missed and disappeared in the sky.There was no time to relax. Even as Lily watched her friends lower their wands, she could feel that something was wrong, that something seemed to be watching her, closing in fast –"We have to move," said Remus, pulling James up from the ground. "The rest of them aren't far, we saw figures moving through the forest; if we stay here, we're giving them a chance to regroup."As if on cue, outraged yells sounded behind them, growing louder by the moment."I don't know about you, but twelve against eight aren't very good odds," said Frank.They sprinted towards the Shrieking Shack, climbing the hill; Lily could see the last golden rays of sunlight streaming from over a mountain, an irony that contrasted with what they were facing right now.A sudden spell blasted the side of the hill, peppering her with earth and snow; where her foot had been moments before, a crater had appeared. She glanced behind, barely seeing the dark outlines of multiple figures. Her wand shot spells at random, desperately praying that they found their marks –But suddenly a hand pulled her roughly upwards, towards the top of the hill: they had reached the Shrieking Shack at last. James and Lily darted around the building as more spells came from below, hitting the shack –"Too late!" shrieked a delighted voice, the unmistakable tone of Bellatrix Black. "Too weak, too foolish! A haunted building is nothing compared to the might of the Dark Lord!""Get inside," muttered Remus, kicking down a loose plank of wood in the wall. They all entered; Lily's heart was beating so quickly she was sure she would die…"Hiding will not save you!" bellowed another voice; she didn't recognize it. "Nobody will save you! Dumbledore is miles away, and the Dark Lord approaches ever closer!"Inside, the shack was a mess. The furniture was torn and clawed, as though an animal had rampaged around. She glanced quickly at Remus, but he was too busy muttering spells around the room to notice her."It need not be like this," came a drawling voice, "The Dark Lord wishes for you to join him; you all have a spot in our ranks –""Ignore them," said Sirius angrily, waving his wand around the walls. "Clear your minds, try to stay cool…""I say, Lucius, we just kill them!" said Bellatrix. Lily peeked out the window and found them all shuffling about, surrounding the shack like they had done in the Three Broomsticks."We hear them out first," said the drawling voice. "The Dark Lord is eager for them to join… but what is your answer?"He directed that last bit towards the Shrieking Shack, but they all remained quiet. They glanced at each other furtively, trying to think of a plan. Out of the corner of her eye, Lily thought she saw something pop into being in the corner of the room, red and long, but she couldn't make it out in the darkness. She wasn't sure if anyone else had seen it, but before she could say something, the voice spoke again."Nothing?" he said coolly. "My, my… what a stubborn group of schoolchildren."There was a BANG and the shack shook, raining dust from the ceiling that Lily shook out of her hair."Last chance," said the drawling voice. "Either you come out, and pledge your allegiance to the Dark Lord, or you die, like those unworthy of being in our world."The shack shook again, groaning and shuddering as another spell was shot at it. Lily held James's hand tightly; he looked scared out of his mind, but she thought, rather ridiculously, that he had never looked quite as handsome as he did in that moment…"We've got to attack first," hissed Alice. "Like last time –""They'll be ready for that!" snarled Marlene."What choice have we got?"Her friends pressed their backs against the walls, gearing up to fight, but Lily held back, her instincts told her wait, to not attack yet – with a helpless glance she looked at the corner of the room, but the feather lay there uselessly, unmoving…"Come on," whispered James. "Give it all you've got –""WAIT!" hissed Lily.For the feather had suddenly floated up into the air; her friends turned to look, but just as quickly as it had appeared, it vanished, covering the room in a dim, fiery glow that died quickly."So you've decided to die!" shrieked Bellatrix madly. "Go on then, Lucyyy –""Ready yourselves!" bellowed the voice of Lucius. "Destroy the shack –"Lily's friends frantically raised their wands; she saw Peter shut his eyes tightly –"Don't attack yet!" whispered Lily, though her mind was telling her she was crazy. "Something's going to happen –""WE'RE GOING TO DIE, EVANS, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN!" roared Sirius."– NOW!"Then many things happened at once.An explosion went off – somewhere in the vicinity of the rallying Death Eaters, and Lily heard them scream as they slammed into the walls of the shack. A blinding, jagged jet of white light streaked through the air, like lightning; it hit the ground before them, and though Lily couldn't see what it had done, it must have been effective, for suddenly all was quiet outside, and no spells came their way."To me," said a powerful voice, booming so loudly the residents of Hogsmeade must have heard it. "Death Eaters are not welcome here. To me.""Dumbledore!" cried James, looking through a broken window.Lily whipped her head round to the window, her heart in her throat. Near the padded gate that separated the Shrieking Shack from Hogsmeade, his wand held high above his head, stood Albus Dumbledore. Straining her eyes, she saw multiple figures behind him, but there was one that stood out above the rest – Professor McGonagall looked furious.Hisses were heard all around her. The roof shook, and then it elevated slightly, as though a weight had been lifted off it. The same black smoke from earlier in the forest streaked towards the sky, leaving behind a trail. Dumbledore made his way towards them, his face weary and his silver beard disheveled.The door to the Shrieking Shack burst open, and in strode the teachers, checking the room quickly. When he seemed satisfied, Dumbledore turned to Lily and the others, and spoke, "Are you all alright?""We're OK, Professor," said Alice immediately. Dumbledore nodded in a business-like manner."You will please follow Professor McGonagall to Hogsmeade," he continued, "There you will take the main route to Hogwarts –""Professor, I have another idea," interjected Remus quickly, glancing at James and then back at Dumbledore. "It would be quicker, safer, if we used the passage underneath –""Ah, but that is where I am afraid you are wrong, Mr Lupin," said Dumbledore briskly. "All passages to and from Hogwarts have been sealed with impenetrable magic – it seems the Death Eaters have taken precautions. The only path they could not block was the largest, most powerful: the main road."He turned to Professor McGonagall. "Minerva, ensure that they are brought safely to school. The road is large – and exposed. Mr Longbottom…" he directed these words towards Frank, who stiffened, "you are an Auror, and are therefore qualified as a protector. Please help Professor McGonagall.""Of course, Professor," said Frank.Dumbledore nodded again, his face grim and ancient. "I must patrol the grounds, Filius, would you –?" he turned to the short Charms teacher, who nodded earnestly, "Very well. I will be nearby, should trouble find you all. Minerva, keep your wand ready and don't let your guard down. I could be mistaken, but I could feel when Lord Voldemort was nearby…" he sighed. "Off, then."The journey back to the forest was long and cold. It had stopped snowing, something that Lily was grateful for. Dumbledore had left shortly after they had, taking Professor Flitwick and Professor Slughorn with him, looking quite terrifying as he surveyed the Hogsmeade grounds. At that moment, walking on a snowy, muddy path through the forest, she suddenly understood why Voldemort feared Dumbledore.She slipped her hand into James's. Neither of them exchanged words, nor did anyone else in their group, but it was nice, she thought, to feel the warmth of someone you liked, someone you cared about. It felt especially anchoring when she thought back to the previous events. She'd nearly died multiple times during the span of those few hours since she'd left the Three Broomsticks.Frank cleared the way ahead of them, going first with his wand raised; he would wait at spots and would continue his scouting once they'd reached up to him. Lily and James were directly behind McGonagall, and their friends formed a sort of line behind them, like a mum ducky guiding her little ducklings."How is it, Mr Longbottom?" asked McGonagall suddenly. They all stopped; Lily nearly bumped into McGonagall, but James caught her."It seems OK," came his answer.Lily stared forwards. They'd reached the village much quicker than she thought they would. Smoke billowed out of the buildings and houses, though Lily knew these were caused by fires. The village was oddly quiet; she thought she'd hear some screaming, but no one did. It seemed as though the Death Eaters had left Hogsmeade. Perhaps Dumbledore had scared them off."Quickly, now, we don't want to stay here any longer than we should," barked Professor McGonagall, and Lily marched forwards with her. Frank fell back and joined the group, taking up the spot beside James; they all kept their wands aloft and stared around.They passed through the houses, where Lily was relieved to see that people were bustling about inside, panicked looks on their faces. At least they weren't dead, though she thought that that was a horrible worst-case scenario. McGonagall led them through the same alley that Lily and James had gone through, avoiding the roads and keeping out of sight. They strode past Zonko's, which looked as though a dragon had decided to make it its dinner. She doubted that it would put them out of business – or at least cut down on production, though she couldn't help but hope. She felt slightly guilty at that.The main square was visible now. Hogwarts towered in the distance, its way clear and inviting. Glancing around, Lily saw the Three Broomsticks still looked as though a bomb had been set up inside. She felt even guiltier as she thought of poor Rosmerta, who only wanted peace and quiet. She wondered sadly how long it would take to make repairs."All right," said McGonagall, looking relieved. "I suppose we should wait for Professor Dumbledore and the others to finish patrolling, but I think you've had enough of Hogsmeade."The others nodded fervently at that. Lily looked up longingly at the towering black castle, where she knew was the only place in which she could feel relaxed after all that had happened. Once she got there, she decided, she would take a long, hot bath. She didn't care if all the water at Hogwarts ran out, all she wanted was to feel safe, preferably with James to talk to later…She looked up at him. He still looked the same as he had in the Shrieking Shack, with his set jaw and his furrowed brow and those unsure hazel eyes that conveyed his true feelings. She wondered what he was thinking about at the moment."Keep together," said McGonagall, turning to look at them. "Make sure none of you get left behind. I'm sure Professor Dumbledore will send word as we're heading back –"But she did not get to finish her words, for suddenly something large and silver swooped down from the sky. Regal and proud, the phoenix soared over their heads, staring down at them as though they were potential prey. Lily saw the others turn to look, their mouths open, and then the Patronus spoke in Albus Dumbledore's voice:"Stay where you are. He is still here."At these words, the group suddenly closed in, their backs to each other. James pulled Lily close to him; there was no way they'd get separated, and there was no way he would let Voldemort lay a spell on either of them.McGonagall forced the rest of them behind her, guarding the front; her eyes darted all around the village, where the rest of the civilians had heard: James heard the sound of slamming doors and clicking locks as they boarded themselves in their own houses. A smaller, more timid part of him suggested hiding with one of them, but his usual explosive self immediately shut down the idea. It was cowardly, and not-at-all Gryffindor-like; besides, there was no telling whether Voldemort knew their position. If they took up shelter in a person's home, Voldemort might just blast through.So what to do?He scanned his surroundings. They were fully exposed, looking very much like a bunch of sitting ducks as they grouped together in the main square, their eyes wide and fearful, but James's heart burned excitedly. He would never admit it, but the last few near-death experiences had energized him, much as Quidditch did.The clouds above darkened and rippled, as though readying for a storm. If it started raining, on top of having to step on cold snow, James would really lose it there. He glanced around him desperately, trying to think of a plan. He was Head Boy, for Merlin's sake, he should be a leader, not have other people protecting him –The sky rumbled, and then McGonagall said suddenly, "Get behind!"James hastily threw up a shield charm, and the rest of them scooted around the square, eyeing the black clouds suspiciously; in his mind's eye, he saw Voldemort's head above the clouds, leering down at them –He felt the air shift; somehow, he felt it, and then a metallic scent permeated his senses. Without glancing at McGonagall, without even thinking about it, he threw up his free arm and pushed the group back, thrusting his wand in front of him –Black lightning forked from the clouds, striking the middle of the square and raining rubble on them. Energy arced upwards, its tendrils merging together to form a single, deadly beam; it shot from the air towards the shield, which broke immediately, and James felt a sudden pain as it raced up his arm, stinging all of his particles –The pain died suddenly, and Lily and Sirius caught him before he hit the ground. His cloak gave off an odd burning smell that he registered dimly through his jumbled senses, but at least he was still conscious. His ears felt as though someone had stuck a bell in them and was hitting it continuously. Smoke emerged from where the lightning had struck, covering the square entirely and hiding the buildings and houses that surrounded them.Shapes moved in the smoke. James heard screaming all around him; there was a girly voice in his ear, repeating the same word, "JAMES! JAMES!"... but he felt the ringing grow louder, he could feel himself slip, lose focus…And before he knew it, he was staring up at the tip of a black wand, its body racing with energy. He felt someone tug his shoulders, and he blindly allowed them to guide him backwards, still looking at the wand –The smoke cleared as the black-robed figure waved and swished; alone he was, tall and menacing, with a white face and scarlet eyes. He stared around, almost with relish; relish in the fact that he had gotten past Dumbledore and the Ministry, gotten past them all –James met his eyes. He was trembling, his legs felt like pudding; he was rooted to the spot, unable to move, unwilling to let Lily drag him to safety. His vision tunneled, and all he saw was him, James, and the snakelike face that had spoken in his dreams –Voldemort whipped his wand, green light flashing all around him, and then his mouth moved."Avada Kedavra."The spell flew towards him slowly, as though time had decelerated. His mind registered what was happening, but his body, still trapped in whatever spell had been cast on it, couldn't react. He heard strangled shouts and muffled screams, but he knew, somehow, that they wouldn't reach him in time –The ground rose before him, like a wall; the Killing Curse hit the earth and it disintegrated into dust, and then James felt his body tense as he fell to his knees; he'd broken out of the spell, but Voldemort was not paying attention to him, his scarlet eyes were staring to his side, his mouth curled downwards in a terrifying snarl as a tall figure in billowing blue robes frowned disapprovingly at him."Tom," said Dumbledore, his voice quiet, yet James could hear him clearly. "I'm afraid I am not at all happy to see you."Behind Dumbledore, Flitwick and Slughorn fanned out, their wands gripped tightly in their trembling hands. James felt multiple bodies heave him off the ground and drag him. Off to his side, he heard Sirius's voice mutter, "Tom? That's his name?""But I am, Dumbledore," said Voldemort softly, not taking his eyes off him. "I come bearing gifts.""We do not accept gifts from criminals or murderers!" squeaked Flitwick immediately. "Begone, snake!"Voldemort paid him no attention. He merely straightened, taking in his surroundings, yet his grip on his wand did not loosen."Is this a way to greet an old student?" whispered Voldemort. "My, my… Hogwarts's standards have fallen… And these –" he waved his wand carelessly at James and the others, and they all yelped and rushed back, "Your students, I presume?"Dumbledore did not answer. He was still staring at Voldemort with those piercing blue eyes, his face still set in that disapproving frown, as though Voldemort was merely a student who had shown him a disappointing project."But – no…" said Voldemort suddenly, and then he turned to James again, now regarding him curiously, "I have heard of you three… Longbottom, Black, and Potter…"He exchanged glances with Sirius and Frank. So the Death Eaters had been telling the truth. Voldemort did know them. Next to James, McGonagall shot him a warning look so as to not respond."Join me," whispered Voldemort, his face suddenly hungry with greed. "Those with pure blood should stick together, no?""Tom," said Dumbledore before any of them could retort. "I request that you leave immediately. The Aurors are coming.""And I welcome them, old man." Voldemort strode backwards, circling the large crack where his spell had struck. "The more that receive the gift, the better…"He pointed his wand at the fault; there was a bang, and suddenly something peeked out from the crack, something large and pointy. A stake emerged, and tied to the stake was a man; nearly naked, nearly dead, he was lifted up, guided by the movement of Voldemort's wand. James's stomach tightened, he knew what was coming somehow, it was as though he'd seen it –"Imperio."Voldemort pointed his wand at the old man, and suddenly he became rigid, and then he went limp. He turned back to Dumbledore and the rest of the Professors, who had horror-struck looks on their faces."Attack me, Dumbledore, and he dies." Voldemort twitched his wand slightly, and the old man lurched his arms pathetically. "But you know him, don't you? Your old friend, the Mudblood, Theodore Plant."The old man raised his head, his eyes rolling back into his head, and he gave a slow nod as though confirming Voldemort."He is my beacon, Headmaster," continued Voldemort, fingering his wand. "A beacon for all who wish to join me, in the cleansing –" he turned to look at James again, but he did not squirm, "A light that will guide them to the right path.""A path that brings sorrow to all who come across it," said Dumbledore quietly. "A path that you've carved out of blood and skin, that strangles all of its travelers. No, Tom, it is not the right path.""You call me Tom as though we are friends, Dumbledore," said Voldemort coldly. "I am Lord Voldemort.""But I have given you the reason, have I not?" Dumbledore smiled bitterly, as though remembering something painful. "Or perhaps your memory is not as good as it once was, Tom…"James turned his head quickly back and forth, as though watching a Quidditch match. The aura the two wizards gave off was frightening, electrifying – he did not want to be there, but McGonagall's hand was gripping his shoulder tightly, not allowing him to move, even to guide the others to safety…More people emerged from behind Dumbledore. They surged forwards, their wands raised; close to him, he heard Frank exhale in relief – for Mad-Eye Moody was among those who had come, looking furious – half a dozen Aurors formed a single line behind Moody, all looking in the same direction…Voldemort spread his hands. Out of nowhere, as though they had always been there, Bellatrix and the rest of the Death Eaters appeared, black smoke trailing off of their robes; they formed a circle around Theodore Plant, their eyes darting around behind their masks."Here is my gift, Dumbledore," said Voldemort coldly. With a twitch of his wand, Theodore opened his mouth, and out slithered a snake; bigger and heavier than what could have possibly been stored inside his body, but it slithered nonetheless. He tried to scream, but the noise was muffled by it; the snake coiled upwards, wrapping its body around his neck, and it squeezed.Theodore shuddered, and then became limp. The Aurors roared and surged forwards, but stopped abruptly as the Death Eaters brandished their wands at them."Release him, Voldemort!" For the first time, Dumbledore looked worried. He unsheathed his wand, fire streaming from its tip dangerously as he, too, pointed it at the Death Eaters. McGonagall pulled him and the rest of the students backwards, inching closer to Flitwick and the teachers.Voldemort did not listen. He flicked his wand again, and this time, green flames erupted from Theodore's skin. The snake hissed, trying to escape the fire, but it seemed unable to release its grip from Theodore's neck. James watched, horrified, as the stake burned, and smoke plumed upwards towards the sky…"The beacon is lit," said Voldemort quietly. "Those who wish to follow it shall be guided to me."McGonagall gasped, something that James had never heard before, but then he saw why – the smoke from the fire had collected in one single space, darkening the sky around it. It shifted and changed until it formed into a colossal skull, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a long, monstrous tongue.Dumbledore and the Aurors strode forwards, firing spells that the Death Eaters deflected hastily, but before anything else could happen, Voldemort vanished in a swirl of robes. Cries were heard around him, but nothing passed through his ears, James's heart was thumping loudly, masking any sound as he stared at the stake…James closed his eyes, slumping to the ground. He did not want to see anything anymore. The image of the Dark Mark burned in his mind, and Theodore Plant's mangled corpse he remembered even more vividly. He couldn't bring it to himself to even find Lily's hand. He doubted whether he would go to Hogsmeade again…He felt cold drops of twinkling snow fall on his neck. He quickly covered it with his scarf, but his gloveless hands had smudged the snowflakes. James stared at his fingers, unable to comprehend why they were suddenly black –He looked up at the sky. Black sleet was falling, dispersing the Dark Mark, and yet he just continued to stare at it dumbly, unable to fully comprehend what had just happened. A gentle hand lifted him off the ground, and he heard McGonagall's voice tell him to go back to the castle. She sounded as though she was about to cry.Slowly but surely, the Dark Mark faded into the clouds. He saw, glancing back, that Theodore Plant had been removed from the stake. Flitwick led the way in front of him, shaking slightly. His mind still throbbed at the memory of Theodore's body. He could no longer remember his nightmare.This was so hard to write. Dear God, I'm so fucking tired, and I'm no way near satisfied with how it turned out, but at least it's better than what I had before. I kept redoing this, thinking out scenes for the plot, but I feel it's still lacklustre. Only reason I'm allowing this to be posted is because I wanted to slump through and get at least a chapter done before September ended. I have my midterms coming up, so I'm going to be writing a whole lot less.October, though, is Jily month. I'm going to keep writing, even if I'm a little burnt out from this stupid chapter. Thank you, and I'm sorry for the late upload. Read and Review, as always. While we're on the topic, thank you again to the guest review who pointed out that I keep reuploading my chapters. I didn't think it would be too much of a bother, because I don't know anyone who still religiously checks their emails, but obviously I've been thick. The reason I do this is that either I've made some big changes to the plot that I thought of after publishing the chapter, or I've uploaded the wrong doc by accident. Sorry. Since you're anonymous, I can't thank you, but if you happen to be reading this, well, er... thanks. 

Chapter Eleven: A Furry Little ProblemLooking back, even two weeks later, James still found it hard to process what he and his friends had gone through. He had fresh nightmares every night – of skulls and snakes, and sometimes even the odd bout of malicious laughter, but he always pushed them to the back of his mind. He did not want to remember.James tried to pull himself together during those two weeks. He'd smiled and joked like his usual self when he was in class, but after it was over, when he was no longer under the caring eye of Professor McGonagall or any of his teachers, he returned to his solemn mood that he only showed to his closest friends.He had not known Theodore Plant, and he wasn't going to pretend that he had known him. In truth, the conductor's death had affected him very little, and he was guilty that it did – Theodore deserved better, deserved to be remembered after all he had gone through. The Daily Prophet didn't help matters; they barely mentioned Theodore Plant, instead writing him off as the only casualty that had taken place in the attack. James suspected that the Ministry was behind this, seeing as they'd written about how Voldemort's attack was a failure, and that the Ministry had ultimately won. He did not much care about it.As for what was going on inside the school – well, it was Hogwarts, after all, and rumours were bound to crop up. That Sunday, after the attack, Dumbledore had talked to the school about how he and the rest of his friends had been directly involved in what had happened. Ever since, James found himself the target of whispered conversations and pointed fingers, even though Dumbledore had explicitly requested the school not to bother him and his friends. He guessed that they were making their own theories as to why he had been targeted by Death Eaters. Again, he did not care very much.Every evening after dinner, he and Lily would lock themselves up in the Head's Tower. They were inseparable these days, and though James wished that the reason for it was not so horrible, he was grateful nonetheless. While Sirius was – and would always be – the first person he would go to when he was feeling worried, he didn't want to bother him with something that he was also going through. It didn't matter very much; Lily was a good listener, and she'd promised that they'd get through it together.Sometimes, James didn't even sleep in his own room. He did not dare go to Lily's dorm, for fear of being hexed – but she'd also caught on to what was going on with him, and had joined him in his long thinking sessions in the common room sofas. They didn't talk much during those periods. They didn't need to. She understood what he was going through, and he understood as well; the best they could do was to support each other, and move on."I see them, too," she said softly one night, leaning into his chest. "I'm tired of it.""S'not so scary now," admitted James. "Kind of boring, really…"They didn't say anything after that. James knew that she knew that he was only trying to lighten the situation, but she didn't comment on it. A moment later, Lily had fully relaxed, and her soft puffs of breath told him that she was asleep. He smiled to himself, suddenly feeling a great rush of affection for the witch snoozing on his chest, and he closed his eyes too.Snow fell from the sky in the form of small, individual snowflakes, swirling against the windows; the end of the term was nearing, and with it, Christmas. James and the rest of the Marauders watched happily as Hagrid barged into the Great Hall on Saturday morning, carrying the last of the twelve Christmas trees. Garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the rails and bannisters of the stairs; enchanted candles floated high up in the ceiling, forming a sort of aurora; live fairies of all sorts of colours flew about the room, flashing different lights that clashed magnificently with the candles.The Marauders had taken it upon themselves to help with Christmas decorations, too. Just last night, they'd enchanted the suits of armour to follow around unsuspecting students, belching out merry tunes that James found rather annoying after hearing them for the umpteenth time. He'd made sure that the professors would have a hard time undoing the charms – he wasn't going to make it easy for them."I think we've tortured them enough, Prongs," said Remus wearily, as 'My Baby Gave Me a Hippogriff for Christmas' echoed around the Great Hall yet again.James looked at him. The full moon was in a few days, and his friend wasn't looking too good. "Well, that's their problem now. They're just going to have to bear with it.""Correction," said Remus, picking at a scar on his neck, "I think I've been tortured enough."Sirius gave a bark of laughter. "The charms'll wear off in a few hours, don't worry. And stop touching that thing, Moony, it's never going to heal that way."There was a great rush of fluttering wings at that moment; looking up, James saw the morning post owls swoop in through the upper windows. A black screech owl carrying a long, furled scroll landed in front of Sirius, who looked surprised.The owl looked strangely familiar. Peter started to say, "Hey, isn't that…"Sirius tried to tug the scroll from its beak. The owl looked at him reproachfully."Come off it," muttered Sirius. He finally managed to pull it away; the owl nipped at his fingers rather aggressively and took off at once, making sure to clip Sirius with its wings.Sirius unfurled the scroll, mumbling darkly, and began to read. The further down his eyes travelled the parchment, the more pronounced became his scowl. His grey eyes flashed dangerously as he finished reading."Sirius?" asked James uneasily. His best mate got up abruptly, not looking at any of them, and then left the table.James stared around at his friends, who looked just as confused as he did. "What do you reckon?""I dunno, but we should let him cool off before we do anything drastic," murmured Remus, taking a bite out of his toast. "Must be something about his family."That sounded quite reasonable. A moment later, a certain redhead and her two friends sat down across them, shooting him a disapproving look."What did you lot do to Sirius?" asked Lily. "He didn't even say hi to Marlene.""We didn't do anything," said James. "He got a letter and then stormed off.""A letter?" said Marlene, frowning deeply. "From whom?""That was definitely a Black family owl," said Peter, glancing at the vacant spot that used to be occupied by Sirius. "I've seen enough Howlers from Sirius's mum to recognize one."James looked at the Great Hall's double doors; Sirius was probably far away now. When he turned back to the table, he found Lily was still frowning at him. His mind went into overdrive, replaying every conversation he'd had with her, trying to find what he had done wrong. Perhaps he'd said something last night without meaning to? Maybe she'd mistaken one of his jokes for actual opinions. He really should keep his mouth shut sometimes."What?" asked James, giving up."Aren't you going to look for him?" said Lily. James let out a small sigh of relief. "You're his best mate, after all.""Nah," answered Remus for him. "He'll want to be alone for a while. Besides, Sirius gets moody easily, we're going to let him cool off."When Lily still looked reproachful, James sighed and reached for her hand across the table. "Look, love. Sirius wouldn't want us to worry about him, he's just that kind of bloke." He glanced quickly at Marlene, and then added, "You shouldn't go after him, either. Let him take out his frustration. We'll check on him later.""Oh, all right," relented Marlene, easing into her bench. "It's just – even after all this time, I can never tell how he's feeling.""He'll come around," said Alice, patting her arm."I wonder what the letter was about," said Lily absently. "Maybe they're asking him to transfer to Slytherin or something.""I don't think so," said Remus, knitting his eyebrows together. "He would've just laughed it off, he's been sent dozens of letters like that. Whatever it was, it was something big – and personal.""Well, I just hope this gets resolved quickly," said Marlene. "He usually never gets upset, it's strange seeing him like that."And she cast an oddly furtive look at James."Trust me, Marls, we're just as confused as you are," he assured her.Sirius Black sat under the shade of the beech tree by the edge of the still-unfrozen-lake, holding his crumpled letter in a fist. His head was swimming with thoughts and emotions – guilt that he had ditched Marlene, and more importantly, his friends; contempt at the godforsaken piece of rubbish he held in his hands; disgust at himself for feeling like this. Mostly, though, he felt anger.The nerve of that woman… Sirius swore, for as long as he lived, he would never speak to her again. His mother had that effect on many people, bribing and lying and flattering to get what she wanted, and then – boom, her true colours showed.He balled his fist up even more, trying to ignore the heavy words that had been written in the parchment. She had confirmed what Bellatrix had said a few weeks ago – that he had been blasted off the family tree, and that he was no longer considered family. Not to her, anyway.Even though he knew it was foolish to do so, he had secretly hoped that Bellatrix had been lying. He had hoped that his mother, insufferable as she may be, would find it in her black heart to admit that she was wrong, and apologise to him.He'd underestimated just how nasty his mother could be. Aside from basically disowning him, she'd also demanded that he return the money Uncle Alphard had given to him, which was a new low. Not wanting to open the letter, he closed his eyes, and remembered his mother's words…The Black family demands that the contents of Alphard Black's will, including the thirty thousand (30,000) galleons he has left you, be transferred to the Black family vault (Vault 711) no later than by March 1st. If the Black family does not hear from you, this case shall be promptly filed in the small claims court.Hoping you are well,Walburga Black, heiress of House BlackSirius levitated the ball of parchment in the air, and promptly set fire to it. He imagined his mother's head in place of the letter."Careful, or you'll burn down Hogwarts. We're still not done putting up Christmas decorations."Sirius whipped his head towards the source of the voice; he found James striding over to him, his hands in his pockets, and an apologetic expression on his face."Oh," said Sirius hollowly, "It's you."James sat down next to him, leaning against the base of the tree. "Do you wish it weren't me?""No, no," he sighed. "I'm glad you're here."The ashes from the parchment were scattered in the cold wind. Sirius picked up a small pebble and threw it across the lake, where it skipped once… twice… thrice, before it sank beneath the surface on its fourth skip."The letter," said James slowly, "what was it about?""Nothing, really," he said bitterly, preparing to throw another rock. "Just my dear old mum asking for my money. As if she hasn't got enough already.""That inheritance from your uncle?" said James, looking at him. "But he said – explicitly stated – in his will that you were receiving it, not anyone else. If the Ministry follows their own laws at all, the money can't be taken from you…""I don't expect Mum will handle that very well." The rock didn't skip at all, instead plopping pathetically as soon as it landed on the lake. "I've been officially disowned, too.""Doubt it," said James absently, using his wand to launch his own pebble into the lake. "Blood bonds are hard to break. Impossible, in fact.""Just a few months ago, you were the one telling me that blood meant nothing.""And I still stand by it," said James. "Blood doesn't mean family, mate. But when it comes to magic, you'd be hard-pressed to, er… sever the ties left by blood bonds. That's what my dad says, at least…"There was silence between them after that. They engaged in a silent competition – whose pebbles would skip the furthest would receive bragging rights – and ultimately Sirius won, his record of six total skips impossible to beat by James."Did you mean what you said during my birthday?" he said after a short pause, turning to James. "About how you're tired of me living in your house?""Of course not," said James firmly. "I was just taking the mickey, you know that. My parents love you, you're a part of our family now as far as we're concerned.""Oh," was all he could say, and he turned a pebble in between his fingers nervously."You can't seriously be thinking that we'd abandon you?" said James incredulously. "I'm hurt, mate.""No, it's not that," he said quickly. "I was just thinking – well, I was reminded – since I've got a bit of money now, I could finally move out, get my own place…"James appeared to consider the idea. "I mean, if you want to, you know Mum and Dad will always support you. I reckon they'd want to wait until after school, though.""Yeah, I'm not in a hurry to live on my own," said Sirius. "We've got all the time in the world, anyway…""That we do," said James quietly.A comfortable silence followed. Sirius felt better, much better than he had that morning; it was as though an enormous weight had been lifted off his shoulders.To hell with my family, thought Sirius savagely. I'm disowning them."Let's get out of here," he said, standing up. "If anyone sees me, my reputation'll go down the drain…""I've got an idea," said James, accepting Sirius's hand. He pulled out a folded piece of parchment from inside his robes; The Marauders' Map. "I saw Mulciber and Wilkes all alone on the sixth floor, there's a chance they might still be there…""You read my mind," said Sirius, grinning. "Moony and Wormtail coming?"James unfolded the map, his eyes travelling all the way towards the sixth floor, where two lone figures sat in an empty corridor. He grinned back. "You bet."The following Thursday, after a long, boring day of classes, three-quarters of the Marauders were lounging in the Head's common room with Lily. James watched amusedly as his girlfriend and his best mate argued over Quidditch, once or twice grunting in agreement when they directed their questions at him."... you're mad if you think the Cannons are better than the Wasps, Black, I can't believe you'd say something so wrong and stupid –""It's not my fault the Wasps are a bunch of no-brainers with no talent!" interjected Sirius angrily. James and Peter shared an exasperated look, and then hastily avoided their gazes as Lily threw a pillow at Sirius."I can't believe my own best mate would say this," she muttered, covering her face with her hands as Sirius threw it back at her. "You don't deserve the title."Before Sirius could retort, James stood up hastily, now seeing that the clock was about to strike nine. "All right, that's enough, both of you." He frowned at Lily, and suddenly feeling quite mischievous, added, "For the record, Lils, the Wasps are a bunch of idiots.""Oh sure, side with him, I see how it is now," said Lily sarcastically, crossing her arms in a very flamboyant manner. "Remind me how I ended up with you again?""Now that's a topic I can get behind on arguing," said Peter approvingly, ducking as James swatted his head."All right, that's enough, both of you," said Sirius in a near-perfect imitation of James. "Evans, isn't it past your bedtime? You should go to sleep.""Don't tell me what to do, Black," said Lily, trying to sound cross, but then she yawned wide. "Bloody hell, you three're giving me migraines. I wish Remus were here.""Well, he can't, can he?" James pretended to yawn, covering his mouth as he did so. "Poor Moony…""Ah, he'll be alright." Sirius rubbed his eyes, winking discreetly at him from behind his fingers. "He's strong, Moony.""Shouldn't you two go to the Hospital Wing?" said Lily suddenly, all traces of sleepiness gone, and she was now eyeing Peter and Sirius carefully.James shot Sirius a look that he hoped said, go along with it."Oh – yeah," said Sirius, glancing at Peter. "We've got to help Madam Pomfrey with the – er, process. Right, Pete?"He elbowed Peter rather inconspicuously."Right!" squeaked Peter, attempting an unconvincing stab at airiness. "You'll join us tomorrow morning, James?""Definitely," said James quickly, grateful that he was able to have the final say. "You two should hurry it up, or else Filch'll do you in before you graduate…"He shot them another significant look out of the corner of his eye; Lily didn't see it, and she nodded. "That's right, get out of here, you two. If you don't mind, I have something I need to talk about with your friend Prongs here…""We all know that you two value your privacy," said Sirius teasingly, but he grabbed Peter by the arm and pulled him towards the portrait hole. "Don't stay up too late, now… be good role models for young Wormtail here…"The portrait swung open, and he heard the two wizards say a cheerful farewell to Sirius and Peter. As soon as it closed, he turned to Lily, a mischievous glint in his eyes."Something you needed to talk about, Miss Evans?"She closed the distance between them; James leaned down, his face inches away from hers. She planted her hands on his neck and pulled him towards her, and he let her guide them, he let her set the pace; their lips met, brushing ever-so-slightly, and then they crashed onto each other, hungry and ecstatic; his hands travelled to the side of her face, his fingers tangling themselves in her hair, sweet-smelling and red, and she deepened the kiss, cupping him in her hands.For a few moments their bodies were frozen, savouring the feeling, but then James pulled away reluctantly. Lily made a noise of disapproval, looking up at him with her bottom lip sticking out…Oh Merlin, thought James, trying not to think of what he wanted to think about. If she kissed him again, he would probably forget all about his plans…"I was enjoying that," muttered Lily."I ran out of breath," said James rather lamely. To keep her from saying anything, he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her in a hug. "Also, you're bloody gorgeous, Evans.""Flattery will get you nowhere," mumbled Lily thickly, her face pressed against his chest."Won't it?" James squeezed her a bit tighter, and then he let go. Lily looked most displeased. "I'm quite tired, love. I'm going to bed.""Oh, all right," she relented, and she gave him one last kiss before pulling away, her hair messy from where James had played with it.James climbed the stairs and stayed in his room until he heard Lily's door close. When he was sure that it was clear, he opened his own door discreetly and glanced around.The clock said that it was 9.07. Any later, and there was no telling what Remus would do to himself. Stuffing his Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map inside his robes, he went down the stairs, crossed the common room as quietly as he could, and, giving Lily's door one last careful glance, he slowly opened the portrait hole and stepped through.He held up a finger to his lips as the two wizards opened their mouths sleepily. He made the motion of throwing away an object to the side of his mouth, hoping that the wizards understood. They bobbed their heads up and down, their eyes half-open, and shushed the other rather loudly – and, quick as lightning, they slammed the portrait shut.The empty corridor echoed with the noise.James raised his eyebrows. The wizards were already asleep, apparently not noticing that whatever they had done was not in the least bit quiet. Praying that Lily hadn't heard him, he rounded the corner and found Sirius and Peter leaning against the wall, looking quite annoyed."Took you long enough!" muttered Sirius, accepting his end of the Invisibility Cloak. He wrapped it over his body, and Peter did the same. "If I hadn't known any better, I'd say you'd ditched us!""Don't be ridiculous," snapped James, extracting the Marauder's Map. "There's no harm in waiting a couple of minutes…"Filch and Mrs Norris were inside the Transfiguration Tower, miles away from where they were. Glancing up, James pulled the two of them with him, none of them saying a word until they had reached the Great Hall."I take it from that little display Lily still doesn't know you're an illegal Animagus?" said Peter suddenly, struggling to keep his feet hidden."Of course she doesn't," said James shortly, glancing at the Map again."And just when were you planning on telling her?"James ground to a halt, staring incredulously at Peter. "Can't we have this conversation later?""No, he's right," said Sirius, now appearing thoughtful. "Just when were you going to tell her?""I haven't gotten round to doing that, all right?" said James angrily, pushing the two of them forwards. They climbed out of one of the openings. "If I tell her, I'm going to have to explain that the two of you –""Personally, I'm fine with it," breathed Sirius as they entered the Hogwarts grounds. "If you expect this to last, you're going to have to tell her. Lily's a good bird. I trust her.""Agreed," said Peter.James growled in frustration. "You're one to talk, I'll bet my broomstick you haven't even thought about telling Marlene –""That's because we're not serious," said Sirius, jogging to keep up with him. "She doesn't ask stupid questions –""Listen," said James, trying not to let panic into his voice. He wasn't sure why he was feeling stressed. "We'll have this conversation later, all right? I'll tell Lily eventually, but right now, Moony needs us."Peter promptly turned into a rat and scurried over to the opening in the Whomping Willow; for a moment, the tree froze, and James and Sirius transformed and went down the passage. They found Moony circling around the upper room of the Shack, foam forming in his mouth, gnashing his teeth. Even well into the night, Sirius and Peter's words came back to him. He knew that he would have to tell Lily eventually.He remembered what Lily had said. A relationship is built on trust. We won't be getting anywhere if we keep secrets from each other.Soon, he resolved, as he let Moony pounce on him playfully. He wanted this to last, it was too good not to fight for it…The Marauders pranced around the forest, chasing each other until Moony tired.I'll tell her soon.Prongs, distracted with his thoughts, didn't notice Moony bite a little too hard on Padfoot's leg. His anguished howls snapped him out of his trance, and he saw Moony yelp in surprise and put his paws over his snout. If stags could sigh, he would have.This is going to be a long night, isn't it?They pushed Moony all the way to the Shrieking Shack as the first of Hagrid's roosters crowed. The sky above was still dark, but James was always one to trust chickens.Sirius limped alongside him, growling and snarling as he nudged Moony's end with his snout. James concluded that he was cursing in whatever language dogs spoke in, and he couldn't blame him. The bite on his foot looked nasty.Moony stayed silent, once or twice glancing behind with eyes James thought rather cute to be a werewolf's.He used his antlers to hold up a loose beam in the Shrieking Shack; Moony and Padfoot slipped through, Wormtail holding on tightly to the wolf's fur. James turned his head to the side and squeezed in, trying not to get his antlers caught in anything. Padfoot gave him one last reproachful look and disappeared down the secret passageway.Moony bayed.James had no idea how to comfort a werewolf, so he gave him an awkward sort of pat to the back with his hoof. Moony curled up, apparently not wanting to be seen.He and Wormtail followed Sirius quickly; if they stuck around any longer, Madam Pomfrey might discover them. In no time, they reached the Whomping Willow, and Wormtail scurried up to the opening and touched its roots; the tree became still, and James transformed and exited first. He helped Padfoot out of the hole."Pete, can you get my cloak and the map? Only I've got to carry this stupid dog with me –" he heaved Padfoot onto his back, where the dog clung to his neck like a great, shaggy rucksack. "They're in that bush – no, the other one –"They hurried back to the castle, trying to stay low. Peter led the way, holding the map and covering their snowy footprints. The way ahead seemed clear, and Sirius transformed right after they climbed through the castle walls."All right, mate?" James said alarmedly; Sirius's injury looked even more gruesome without all the fur covering it. "That doesn't look so good."His leg was matted in dry blood that went all the way down to his ankle. Torn flesh and sunken pits from where Moony's teeth had clamped shut formed a sort of U-shape that never seemed to end. The whole area was blue and slightly swollen, and bits of dirty sleet seemed to have lodged themselves inside the wound."Blimey, I didn't notice," snarled Sirius, hopping on his good foot. He gripped James's shoulder for support. "Help me walk…""We need to get you to Madam Pomfrey," said Peter, consulting the map again. "No one's up yet –""Are you mad?" Sirius's voice was hoarse. "Pomfrey'll ask questions, she knows we're Remus's mates, and she probably knows how to identify werewolf bites.""We'll get you to the Head's dorm," said James firmly. "We'll use the healing potion for emergencies.""That's reserved for Remus," muttered Sirius."I think this qualifies as an emergency, Padfoot." Peter slung Sirius's other arm around him. "Come on, there's a good boy…""I'm going to turn you into a rat permanently, Pettigrew –""Wake the whole castle, will you?" said James irritably. "Let's hurry, it's not far from here…"But it felt as though the Head's Tower was miles away. Sirius cursed and muttered under his breath. His face was starting to sweat, never a good sign. James half-considered conjuring a stretcher.Finally, they reached the painting of the two sleeping wizards. James whispered, "Neverland!" and they swung open, not even a hitch in their snoring, and they staggered inside."Lily's still asleep," said James. "We'll get you out with the invisibility cloak, and if anyone asks we'll say that the squid got you –"They stopped suddenly and abruptly as they entered the common room.James's heart skipped a beat.Sitting on one of the couches, a mug of smoking coffee in her hands, looking quite awake, was Lily. She looked at him expectantly, as though she had been waiting all night."Morning," she said absently.James was too scared to say anything.Lily raised her eyebrows. "You're supposed to say, good morning, Lily, after."Next to him, Sirius's face was a brilliant shade of red, appearing very likely to match Lily's hair."You know, it's funny that you're here, James," she continued. "I could've sworn that you said you were going to sleep just a few hours ago."Sirius groaned slightly; he gripped James's shoulders tighter. Lily sipped her coffee."Lily, I promise I can explain –""So imagine my surprise when I heard the painting open." Lily talked over him. "And I knew – either someone had gotten in, or someone was heading out. I concluded it was the latter, and so I waited, and I thought, surely, my own boyfriend wouldn't be stupid enough to go out on the night of the full moon?"Sirius started to pant. James wasn't sure how much longer he could take."So why, James Potter," said Lily, her eyes like slits, "Why were you heading out on the night of the full moon?"For a moment, no one said a word. James cringed slightly; he had never felt as trapped as he did right then."Lily, I swear there's a perfectly good explanation for this," said James, choosing to look at Lily's mug of coffee instead of those intense green eyes, "But Sirius needs help now. He's lost a lot of blood."Sirius raised his leg helpfully, grunting and cursing as he did so; Lily stared at it, her face morphing into an expression of surprise, and then she said tightly, "Fine."Taking that as approval, Peter pushed Sirius onto James's back and they climbed the stairs. His mind was numb; he could not fathom how Lily was feeling at the moment, and he did not want to think of what he would look like after Sirius and Peter left, but he pushed these thoughts to the side and set Sirius on his bed.While Peter conjured bandages and wrappings, James rummaged around in his drawer, trying to find the healing potion. He had stuffed it into one of his socks, he was sure of it, why wasn't it there?Giving up, James turned to his underwear. It wasn't there either.Now slightly desperate, he searched once more through his socks, trying to convince himself that he had missed it. He double-and-triple checked each and every balled-up pair; still no luck. Sirius's muffled grunts were sounding more frequently, and in a last, wild grab, he flung open his bottom drawer – the stash of drinks.A single bottle of Butterbeer rolled over to vision. Sloshing inside, he found that it was not the usual, bright yellow liquid that frothed at the top, but was instead a dark red substance, smooth and calm.He seized the bottle. It was warm and beat slightly, like a heart; he uncorked the top and staggered over to Sirius."Here you go, Pads," said James weakly.Sirius gulped down the potion as he would any other drink. Trickles of red liquid dribbled down his chin, but he continued to guzzle it until it emptied. The bite on his foot smoked slightly, but it looked better."How does it feel?" asked Peter. Sirius merely grunted."Help me get up," he said, stretching his hand out to James. "And make me a Pepperup Potion if you can –""You can't possibly be thinking about going to class?" said James. "Just stay here, Padfoot.""If I don't, Moony'll feel guilty," growled Sirius. "I'm fine, honestly –""No, you're not."Lily stood in the doorway, blocking the exit. She had her wand pointed up. The reason why became apparent soon; two white bags labelled Hospital Wing came floating in a moment later."You're not going anywhere, Padfoot," said Lily. "You boys can tell me why you're like this while I work on your leg."James and Peter glanced at each other nervously. Sirius tried to get up, but Lily pushed him firmly back on to the bed and raised her wand threateningly. He was reminded, quite stupidly, of Madam Pomfrey.She flicked her wand and one of the bags opened; thin, black string slithered out from it, followed by something that looked like a pair of scissors. Another twitch, and a handful of cotton and cloth, as well as a white bottle labelled Alcohol, sailed out from the other bag.Sirius made a noise somewhere in between a sob and a retch. "Wha – what're you going to do to me?""I'm going to stitch you," said Lily. "Unfortunately, a healing potion can't solve everything. You're still going to get an infection, especially if that's a werewolf bite –""You lost me at stitch," said Sirius, horrified. "You're not going to crochet me or anything, are you?""A more accurate description would be sewing your skin together," said Lily grimly. "I'll cast a spell over you so that you won't be awake. It won't hurt – at least during the process. Now stop being a baby and relax."Before Sirius could protest, Lily pointed her wand at him and muttered a spell; in an instant, he'd gone limp and fell on the bed, his mouth hanging open."You lot better tell me how he got this bite, or I'm going to knock you all unconscious," muttered Lily to James and Peter.With another nervous glance, James blurted out the story. Lily was silent as she worked, but he found that this was easier. He stared resolutely at his Quidditch posters as he told her how he and Sirius and Peter had found out that Remus was a werewolf. He started the story there; it had always started with Remus. And then, as Lily paused in her healing and rolled her hands in a go on gesture, he told her about how Sirius noticed how drained and sickly he looked after the transformations. He told her how Sirius had proposed the idea of becoming Animagi in their third year, and how they'd spent the next year cooped up in the library, going through the restricted section, practising the most complex Transfiguration spells and brewing the most disgusting potions until, after a fashion, they were confident enough in their abilities to start the process of becoming Animagi, finally able to transform during the beginning of their fifth year.When he'd finished, Lily still remained silent. She waved her wand back and forth, willing Sirius's skin to get sewn back together. James waited."So you're an Animagus," said Lily finally, packing her medical tools back in her bag. "And – let me get this straight – you became one so that you'd be able to keep Remus company?""During the full moon," responded James."During the full moon," echoed Lily. She straightened up and turned to face him and Peter. James didn't like how he wasn't able to read her face."You don't believe us?" squeaked Peter."I don't know what to believe," muttered Lily, crossing her arms. "Only one way to find out, isn't there?"James and Peter exchanged glances. "You want us to transform – now?""Obviously," said Lily stonily.Peter eyed him nervously, a silent conversation being had between them. James took a step back, and breathed deeply."You might want to move, Lily," murmured James. Lily remained where she was, her face quite impassive.Holding his breath, James cleared his mind of all but the image of Prongs, remembering his sight, his sense of smell, his great, powerful body – and he willed his heart to stop.The second heartbeat grew louder.The change was immediate, as it always was. He was standing on all fours; his head was heavier, much heavier; his vision sharpened, he didn't need his glasses anymore, and his sense of smell suddenly became a million times more powerful, he could smell Sirius's dried blood even when it had been washed off by Lily's alcohol –Lily herself had fallen on the bed, her mouth hanging open in shock. She dropped her wand, which bounced on the bed and struck Sirius with a spell.Sirius woke instantly, sitting bolt upright, his eyes zooming in on his foot. He let out a very un-Siriuslike squeal and rounded on Lily, who was still eyeing James with a mixture of fascination and disbelief."What the bloody fucking hell did –""He's an Animagus," whispered Lily hoarsely, massaging her temples. "James Potter is an Animagus…"Sirius's outraged face became amused once he saw James, and he rolled his eyes. "Stop showing off, you great prat. I'm literally dying over here."Lily turned to him quickly, as though she had just noticed he was there. "And you – Sirius, what –"Sirius grimaced and promptly turned into a dog. Lily jumped, and then stared at him."Wait a moment," said Lily slowly. "I saw you last year, when I was out on the grounds with James –"James transformed back and ran a hand through his hair nervously. The memory swam hazily to the front of his mind – there he was on a fine autumn late-afternoon, taking a stroll along the lake with Lily, and for the first few minutes they were alone, gloriously alone… and then his precious time was destroyed as Sirius came bounding up to them, licking their faces –Sirius turned into his normal, handsome self, looking sheepish. "Yeah, about that –""You kissed me," stammered Lily, a look of horrified realization dawning on her face. "You – the dog – kissed me.""Technically, I licked you," said Sirius, in spite of himself. "And let me tell you, Evans, you wouldn't believe the look on old Prongsie's face –"His words were drowned out by an otherworldly bellow. Somewhere on the floor, there was an odd, squeak-squeak-squeak as Wormtail the Rat laughed heartily."Hello, Moony," said James brightly, traipsing through his friend's bed-curtains."Hello," said Remus hollowly. He wasn't meeting his eyes. "Er – I wanted to ask, is Sirius –?""Evening, Moony." Sirius and Peter appeared out of thin air, drawing back a silky, silvery cloak. "What's up?""I'm sorry!" cried Remus ruefully; over in her office, Madam Pomfrey squinted at them. "I'm sorry, Sirius, I swear I didn't mean to, it's just – Moony – I mean, me – I didn't think I'd lose control again –"Remus buried his face into his fingers. He seemed quite deflated, as though he'd been bottling his emotions for the entire day."Hey – it's alright," said Sirius, patting his hand awkwardly. "Werewolf bites don't affect animals, remember?""Yes, but the pain's still there," said Remus thickly, his voice muffled by his hands. "I can't imagine –""Actually, it's not," said Sirius happily, pulling back his robes to reveal his leg. It was not swollen nor bleeding, and looked relatively normal except for a thin scar with strands of string-like material crisscrossing at certain intervals. Remus peeked through his fingers."It took a day of magical sleep, but I was able to heal up," continued Sirius. "Can't complain, I haven't done Flitwick's essay yet. I tell you, Prongs, your girlfriend is an actual angel…""She most definitely is, she even stopped Marlene from barging into your room to check on you, Pads," said Peter, smirking. Sirius gave a bark of laughter."Wait," said Remus slowly. "Wait, wait, wait… Lily did this? She healed you?""Sure did," said James proudly, before Sirius could answer. "Did a fantastic job, if I say so myself.""She's passed out in the Head's Tower, that's why she isn't here with us," chimed in Peter."I – passed out?" said Remus incredulously. "What exactly did she do?""It's probably from shock," said Sirius, rubbing his healed leg. "You know, from finding out that we're illegal Animagi."Remus let the words sink in before his jaw dropped slightly. "You – you told her?""Yep," said James happily. "She won't tell a soul, you know how Lily is.""I mean – it's your decision, after all, and I trust her –""Good," said Sirius, breaking a chunk off Remus's chocolate bar lying next to him. "Because now that she knows, she won't have to worry about your furry little problem that much anymore…"This was very fun to write, I thought a lighter chapter would be nice after that last one. I'm very sorry for the slow updates; I have my midterms, they'll be finishing on the 15th so after that it's back to my regular scheduled programming. I'll admit I haven't been studying much, I've been using most of my free time finishing Rick Riordan's final CHB book Tower of Nero, as well as rewatching BNHA (chapter 287 just came out and it's pretty nice) and replaying The Witcher 3. There isn't much else to do where I live.Aaaaanywho, read and review, as always, and I hope you enjoy the chapter!

Chapter Twelve: Christmas BreakThe week before term ended, Lily received a letter that, upon opening, its first words screamed out at her as though they had been pent up during the journey from Cokeworth. Dreadful words they were, too, for she immediately gave a strangled sort of yelp that caused James to look at her strangely."All right, love?"Lily shook her head slowly, staring blankly at the piece of paper held in her hands. James raised an eyebrow, concerned."Who's that from?"In answer, Lily handed him the letter. She ran a hand nervously through her hair (something she thought James was responsible for fostering in her) and waited as he read what her mother had written.It took him two minutes to clear his throat and laugh shakily. She saw him set down the letter at the breakfast table next to his half-eaten sausage."So," he began in a falsely cheery voice that made her squirm, "Petunia. Your sister. She's getting married.""Yep," she muttered grimly, not even in the mood to finish her bread and tomatoes."And your mother – Rose," he continued slowly, "she wants us to have dinner with the happy couple.""Yep," she said again."That sounds… fun, I guess?"Lily snorted. "What aspect of dinner with my sister could you possibly find appealing?""Well, after all I've heard from you, not much," he admitted apologetically, scratching the back of his head. "What about this Vernon? Is he –""He's a rude, narcissistic pile of rubbish that looks like a walrus," said Lily, so strongly that James seemed taken aback."I suppose I have no choice but to come?"Was it just her, or did he sound a tad bit excited?She eyed him suspiciously. "Of course you don't have to come. In fact, Petunia'd be over the moon if you didn't.""That seals it, then." James elbowed her playfully. "I'm not going to miss a chance to poke fun at your dear sister or her walrus-to-be. Besides, you wouldn't last two minutes in their company without me.""Even less, I think," she said gloomily, though she was secretly hoping that it wouldn't come to that. "I'll send a letter to my mum to tell her you're coming."Before James could respond, Sirius, who'd apparently been listening intently from across them, said, "Ah, how bad could it be? You two can go to that place where you watch films, the cemina, I think, while –""Cinema, Padfoot, honestly, what've you been doing in Muggle Studies?""Yeah, that," said Sirius, waving her off. "This also gives you a good chance to meet her parents, doesn't it, Prongs?"Lily looked at him in surprise. "Actually, yeah.""And Lily here can come to your place later," continued Sirius. "I think your mum'll be ecstatic to meet her, all the times you've talked about her…"James reddened slightly. "Padfoot…"Sirius turned to her, grinning mischievously. "You have to be there. Marly's staying for a few days as well, that way you won't be lonely.""That's not a bad idea," sniggered Lily. "What're the chances of James's mum loving me more than him?"Sirius stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Astronomical, I'd say. You wouldn't believe how many times James's mentioned you to her, she says you're practically part of the family now –""Padfoot," said James irritably, "Sod off, will you?"Sirius raised his glass of pumpkin juice, his stupid grin still unwavering. "Cheers."The evening before Christmas break, Lily was sat in the Gryffindor common room with the rest of her friends, having just finished packing her things. A few days ago, she'd written a letter to her mother, telling her about James; in her following letter the day after, her mother had been about as excited as a two-year-old for ice cream.She'd written to her mother a lot over her years at Hogwarts. It wasn't like she didn't know what was going on with her. But this was different.Lily had gone out with a number of boys in her time; heck, between her two best friends, she was the one who dated around the most, but she'd never written to her parents about any of them. They were, after all, just distractions for her – distractions that she felt were necessary to keep her mind off of bigger things.She'd written about James before to her parents. The first time, in her first year at Hogwarts, about a boy who liked to joke around and was kind in private, but was mean to Severus – and it sort of escalated from there. Her parents knew who James was. They'd known about him long before they had become partners.So maybe this was why her mother was excited. Lily had never brought her friends home – much less a boy, save for Severus. But that was different.Speaking of James, where was he? It had been a while since she last saw him. She looked around, realizing that she'd spaced out of the conversation. There was Marlene, snuggling up to Sirius, telling what apparently seemed to be an entertaining story to the rest of the group. Alice sat next to Em and Mary, once or twice looking up from her quill and parchment to laugh along with the group. Remus and Peter lay on their bellies near her, playing wizard's Chess; all the seventh years were here, where was James?Probably caught up in Head duties. Nothing to worry about.He'd informed her just last night that his mother had written to him as well; she'd readily agreed to his proposal, and so now, he had told her, for the first time in his life, he would be spending some part of his break in the Muggle world. She wasn't the least bit surprised by that; she knew James had lived a sheltered life under his parents, so he probably had no reason to go out to Muggle Britain. That explained quite a few things about him, now that she thought about it."There you go, zoning out again."Lily looked up, surprised; Remus was staring up at her from the floor, holding a black king in his hand. He smiled lazily at her.She returned his smile. "Well, all of you seemed busy, I didn't want to interrupt anything.""Bollocks." Remus threw the king at Peter, who fumbled it with his hands. "Budge up, will you?""But there's a chair over there," said Lily, amused, but she shifted in her armchair to make space for him."I think I'd rather sit with a friend." Remus stretched his legs and yawned. "So what's on your mind?"Lily wondered what this was about. Remus rarely asked pointless questions, maybe he had noticed something off about her? Or maybe this was a prank, and Sirius/Peter/James had set him up for this?Or perhaps he just wanted to see how she was doing. Yes, that sounded plausible.And so she said, "Nothing, really. Just wondering where James is.""Oh, he's on patrol, didn't you know?""What?" said Lily, surprised. "Is it really one of his patrol nights?"Remus laughed. "Yeah, with Benjy Fenwick. Don't tell me the Head Girl's forgotten her prefects' schedules?""Slipped out of my mind," she said easily. "When's he going to be back?"Remus glanced at his wristwatch. "His patrol's ending in a few minutes, but with James you can never be sure."Lily smirked. "Naturally. So what's been going on with you? It's been a while since we talked, just the two of us."Remus shrugged. "Life's been boring, actually. Focusing on school, hardly ever causing mischief…""Yeah, and I'm best mates with Snape again.""No, really," insisted Remus. "It's usually Sirius and Peter who're sneaking off these days, they just ask for my permission beforehand.""So you've grown out of it?" said Lily, though she thought privately that he had been mature long before now. "About time. You should give those two lessons sometime."He laughed, which was good to hear. "No, I don't think I'll ever grow out of it." He stared wistfully at Sirius and Marlene, who looked so comfortable in each other's arms it made Lily want to hex them. "As for my friends… it may not seem like it, but they've grown."Lily raised an eyebrow at him. "Whatever do you mean?"He blinked. "I mean, if you've lived long enough with those three troglodytes, you start noticing the little things. We've all come a long way.""I suppose – but what's bringing this up?""It's nothing," said Remus hastily. "Look at me, going on about the others. It's pathetic, isn't it?"Lily turned her full attention on him, her gears turning in her mind. "Remus, what –""I told you, forget I said anything." He took a shaky breath, and then tried for a brave smile. "It's just nice to see everybody happy."Lily had no idea what to say. Apparently, Remus didn't either, and he stared solemnly at the fireplace. His scarred face seemed to dim even as he did so."Are you happy, Moony?" blurted Lily suddenly.Remus seemed surprised by her question. Lily immediately kicked herself; what sort of question was that?"Am I happy?" mused Remus. "To tell you the truth – yeah, I guess. I've always been happy at Hogwarts.""Then everything's alright, isn't it?"He looked even more surprised. He glanced once more at Sirius and Marlene – and Lily suddenly understood.Remus smiled – genuinely, happily, a smile that caused his scars to fade ever-so-slightly, and made him look far younger. "Everything's perfect."Sometime later, James Potter entered the Gryffindor common room, scanned the mass of students, and spotted Remus and Lily a bit far away from the rest of the group. He ambled over to them, his arms laden with snacks and desserts."Ooh, apricot," said Lily as soon as he reached them, snatching the danish he held in his hand. Before he could protest, Remus grabbed a handful of rolls and stood up from the armchair. He bent down and whispered something to Lily, who smirked and scooted over a bit more so that James could sit down with her.He watched Moony as he walked away. Lily turned to him."Where've you been?"James bit into his tart. "Kitchens, obviously.""I meant before that, with Benjy Fenwick."Benjy Fenwick?"Well then, you should've said," he said, trying to play it cool. "Fenwick and I were patrolling on the fifth floor. Ran into a couple of Slytherins."He offered her another danish."And?" she asked. "Surely it couldn't have taken so long?"James grimaced. "I'll spare you the details, just know that a whole bunch of points were lost and Fenwick's probably going to limp for a few days, but all-in-all… it went fine."He saw Remus turn his head slightly and shoot him a quizzical look. Keeping care not to let Lily see him, he mouthed, I'll tell you later, and Remus nodded."Is that it?" murmured Lily, frowning. "Must've been some duel, huh?"James squeezed her shoulder, grateful that she hadn't asked for the whole story. He wasn't sure if he could bring himself to tell her the truth. After fifteen minutes, he was slightly disappointed when she announced that she was going to bed, and Marlene jumped up from Sirius's lap instantly; she begged Lily to sleep in their dorm, and after a slight disagreement, she kissed James goodnight and went up the stairs.With the usual noise of many dozens of students following them up, the Gryffindor common room was left nearly empty as the lights were turned off and the candles snuffed out. James, who was in no hurry at all to leave, stayed behind with the rest of the Marauders. Remus frowned at him."You weren't really patrolling with Benjy Fenwick, were you?" he guessed, once everyone had left and there was no one to disturb them. "Good thing Lily forgot about your patrol schedule, because it ended an hour ago and Fenwick was already heading to his common room when I was talking to her.""Was that you?" said James gratefully. "Thanks, Moony. I had no idea why she brought Fenwick up, I was sure I was dead.""Well don't just ramble on, give us the details," said Peter impatiently. "You were with Snape, weren't you?"For a moment, James said nothing at all. He sighed and leaned his head against the back of the sofa, staring up at the dark ceiling."Yeah," he said hollowly. "Ran into him after patrol was over.""Prongs, you idiot," said Remus angrily. "I thought you said you weren't going to go around hexing him anymore.""What was I supposed to do?" exploded James suddenly, running a hand anxiously through his hair. His mind flitted back to his patrol last week, where he had found two Hufflepuff students all alone at night, slumped against the wall and glazed, far-away looks on their faces. Blood had trickled down their chins and onto their laps, dripping slowly, reminding him of far worse things, that crept up in his dreams, that he refused to talk to Lily about –"You should've left him alone, that's what," said Remus in affronted tones, apparently upset that James had gotten angry."And then what?" he snarled, crossing his arms. "Greet him like we're mates, make amends, offer him tea? Say, Hey Snivvy! 'S been a while. Great spell last week, was the vomiting blood a side effect, or did you intend for them to do that?"He looked away, scowling. His hands were shaking slightly."Prongs, I know that what he did was horrible, but –" began Sirius, but he was interrupted by James."Oh, now your brain isn't completely Confunded?" he demanded angrily. "You're one to talk. If you'd seen Snape wandering alone in the dark, I'll bet you would've jumped him as well.""Yes, I would have," said Sirius coldly. "Every time I see him, I can't help but feel like I want to curse that greasy git into oblivion. I thought you'd changed. Lily thought you changed."He remained quite still as the impact of Sirius's words sank into him. He took a deep breath, trying to calm down, and he looked his best mate in the eye."I'm sorry," he said."Don't be," Sirius said coolly.Remus threw bits of his roll at him. "Back to the topic. Did he get you?"The others remained quiet as James moved around his body, trying to remember if Snape had hit him with anything. The duel had been quick, and James had hit him with a nice little spell that would be easy to revert, but he remembered a flash of light, after which his body had convulsed violently…"No," he said finally. "I'm just sore all over, but I think I'm fine."Peter looked relieved. He patted his arm weakly, and James shot him a small smile."Just don't go tangling with him again," said Remus sternly. "He's bad news. Not just for you, but Lily as well.""Yeah, yeah, I've learned my lesson, Moony," said James, though his words passed through his ear and went out the other one. Remus rolled his eyes.James stayed silent, massaging bits of his arm. He was sure Snape would be found soon – it was nearly one o'clock, after all – but he couldn't help but feel the slightest bit of remorse for what he had done. Just a bit."He's something else, you know," murmured James suddenly. "Snivellus," he added, seeing his friends' confused faces, and then he barged on, "He's brilliant. I dunno how he isn't top of the year when he goes around creating spells and all –""I highly doubt he created them, he probably got them from a book in the Restricted Section," said Remus reproachfully."He created them," said James firmly. "Don't tell me you've seen that Sectumsempra being used before –""That's just coincidence, no seventeen-year-old's going to be creating spells, that's much too advanced –""We became Animagi before we turned of age," he reminded him. "We created the Marauder's Map. Messing with spell theory, creating new curses – it doesn't sound so far-fetched.""Yes, but –" Remus appeared to be struggling to find the right words. "That's dark magic, James. I doubt even Dumbledore at seventeen –""Snape's going to be the biggest threat once we graduate," said Peter grimly, cutting Remus off. "We all know he's headed straight for the Death Eater recruitment program next year. Bloody hell, he might even take over for You-Know-Who once he snuffs –"Sirius burst out laughing."Snivellus Snape, take over for Voldemort?" sniggered Sirius. Remus rounded on him."Don't underestimate him," he warned."No one's underestimating him," said James swiftly. "Look, all I'm trying to say is that Snape's probably the most brilliant student at Hogwarts right now, and we should all be careful of him.""That's what I've been telling you," said Remus crossly.As he followed the Marauders up the stairs to his previous dorm, James rubbed his hand subconsciously over his chest, where he knew Snape's scars still remained. He wondered how many more he would have to receive before the war was over. Maybe he should ask Moony."On the train, everybody, let's go!" bellowed James the next morning, holding on tightly to Lily's hand so that they wouldn't be swept away by the crowd. The new conductor, fat and balding (looking very much like Slughorn, but James kept that information private), shouted out similar phrases from the front of the train.They got on the train soon after, once the rest of the students had boarded; he and Lily made their way to the front carriage, where they'd be conducting a prefects' meeting.It was, as James had anticipated, boring, long and tiring. He did most of the talking (Lily had been kind enough to remind him that, after all, last time she had taken charge) and answered most of the questions, rounding it up in the first half-hour of the train ride by giving out the usual instructions.The train ride itself was uneventful. He played hangman with Marlene, who was apparently rather good at the game; he napped on Lily's shoulder, who gradually became annoyed by it and shoved him off halfway through the journey; he read Quidditch Through the Ages for what he felt was the millionth time, until, eventually, finally, the Hogwarts Expressed slowed down and pulled into Platform 9 ¾.As usual, he and Lily got off first, weaving through the crowd of wizards and witches waiting on the pavement. They pushed them all back, his voice slightly hoarse from all the repeating that he did – soon after, the train doors opened, and the students spilt onto the platform."Oh yes, don't mind me as I'm carrying your trunk, Prongs," said Sirius sarcastically from behind them. "Just say your goodbyes and get a move on, or Marly and I'll leave without you."James ignored him. He hugged Lily tightly, trying not to let his emotions spill out. He'd grown used to seeing her every day, spending time with her outside of class, strolling along the grounds; even if it was for a few days, he would miss her terribly.Lily seemed to understand. She smiled weakly up at him, wrapping her arms around her waist."We'll see each other soon," she murmured, so softly James's heart danced. "I'll owl you as soon as I get home, OK?""Yeah, all right," he said heavily, trying not to tighten his grip on her. She stood on her toes and he leaned down instinctively, and then suddenly they were kissing, slow and light at first, and then it gradually became stronger, hungrier, as it usually did – there were a hundred other people watching, he didn't care as long as he could kiss her, one hand on the surface of her warm jumper and another tangling itself in her long, red hair, hiding tantalizingly under her grey winter knit –"Honestly!" said Marlene pointedly, glaring at them both. "It's just for a few days, it's not like you're never going to see each other again!"He pulled back from her, grinning triumphantly. Sirius rolled his eyes and tapped his foot impatiently.The four of them marched through the barrier, where they found Remus and Peter conversing lightly a few feet away from them; James said his goodbyes to them both, though he knew Remus would be joining him and Sirius later that evening, or tomorrow – Peter would be spending his break in Norddeutschland with his mother, which meant he wouldn't be able to see his friend all winter.He finished hugging Peter and ambled off to join Lily. She had just run up to hug a couple – her parents, he guessed. Kind and welcoming they were, though slightly tired-looking as well. James realized, with slight embarrassment, that he had never asked Lily for her father's name.Sirius nudged him with his elbow and he stumbled forwards awkwardly, not at all feeling like the brave, strong Gryffindor he usually thought himself as. Though he was taller than him, James felt as though he was shrinking under Mr Evans's curious gaze.To his surprise, Mr Evans stuck out his hand and smiled warmly at him. "Howard. A pleasure to meet you, Mr Potter."James gripped it tightly, bemused at how his girlfriend's father could be so nice. "Pleasure to meet you too, Mr Evans.""Nice, firm handshake you have there," commented Mr Evans mildly, letting go of his hand. "That's an athlete's grip if I've ever felt one."James glanced at Lily nervously; she rolled her eyes then smiled encouragingly at him."Er – yes, I play Quidditch, sir." He resisted the urge to run his fingers through his hair. "I'm a Chaser, I… er – I catch the ball and score.""I know what Quidditch is," said Mr Evans, smiling at him. "My daughter's told me all about it, why, if I remember, she's mentioned you several times as well –""Dad!" Lily turned red.Mr Evans only chuckled. "Yes, yes, I'll save it for when we officially meet." He turned back to James and then gestured at the pretty woman next to him. "My wife, Primrose."She gripped his hand and shook it enthusiastically. She had Lily's red hair and her fair complexion; her eyes, pale and so unlike Lily's, were rimmed by a pair of large glasses that were slightly lopsided, like James's."We've heard so much about you, James Potter," she said, and then she whispered into his ear, "Between you and me, you're the only person that Lily's ever brought home from school, so you must mean a lot to her."He felt his face heat up and his tongue tie in a way that made him unable to speak; Mrs Evans only smiled at him and let go of his hand. She then turned to Lily, who appeared as though she wanted to dissolve into the wind.Mr and Mrs Evans said a few words to Lily, to which she only nodded, and went off to the car park and waited patiently by their Cadillac.Lily turned to him, her face torn between amusement and despair. "Some parents, huh?"James laughed, letting his nervousness go. "I think they're great. They look like you."She stepped forwards and planted another kiss on his lips; he kissed back, almost wistfully."I'll owl you as soon as I can," she said, repeating her words. She waved a gloved hand and took hold of her trunk, and then went off to her car."They're odd, Muggles," said Sirius, slinging an arm around him. "You know, I always thought Mr Evans would be scary and imposing, because that's what Lily's like, but no, he's this nice bloke with good manners. Makes you wonder whether Lily's a legitimate child."Both James and Marlene elbowed him rather roughly at that, and he doubled over in his laughter."To Potter Manor, then?" said Marlene, taking hold of his and Sirius's hands. "My Mum and Dad'll come visit us in a few days, fair warning.""I always liked your parents, Marls," said James, relieving Sirius of the weight of his trunk. "To Potter Manor, then."Returning to the Muggle world wasn't such a bad thing, Lily had come to realize over the years, but she couldn't help but admit one teensy little fact: it was so very, incredibly dull.She missed Hogwarts. She missed the magical staircases that used to make her queasy in her first year. She missed the sound of the morning post owls swooping in through the ceiling of the Great Hall. She missed the food and the House Elves, whom she had come to regard as her friends. She especially missed getting yelled at by McGonagall after being late to class with James, their uniforms slightly rumpled and their faces very flushed.Thinking about all this, she couldn't help but compare her simple childhood home to the magnificent, magical castle – which she thought rather unfair, because they were two very different places located in two very different worlds. The Evans household didn't have paintings that would laugh at her after tripping over herself, for one thing.She spent most of her evenings up in her room, enjoying her peace; that, at least, was something that remained unchanged. Petunia, she'd been informed, was staying with the Dursleys (she almost puked at the thought) which meant that Lily wouldn't have to see her until the dreaded day.The dreaded day, unfortunately, was coming up rather quickly. She'd agreed to a date two days before Christmas; that way she and James would be able to exchange gifts without getting in the way of their families. After Christmas, all the way until break ended, she'd be staying at the Potters'.The night before her dinner with Petunia, Lily sat on the couch in the sitting room, watching reruns of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer on the telly with her parents. She didn't really pay attention to it, as most of the specials were already ingrained into her mind, and instead chose to read Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland, a short picture book Sirius had given her before the break. Her dad stole glances at the book whenever Hermey disappeared off the screen."Excited about tomorrow, dear?" asked her mother absently.Lily resisted the urge to sigh. "Simply thrilled."She shared an amused look with her father, who only smiled mysteriously and went back to reading her book.Her mother frowned disapprovingly at both her and her dad. "At least try to be nice, Lily – don't you think it's time you put this ridiculous animosity behind you and make up with your sister?""I do try," said Lily, flipping the page. "It's Petunia that won't shut up about me being a witch, she's never failed to remind me whenever I see her, not once, Mum, that I'm a freak and an abnormality –""Petunia is jealous of you, as you very well know," said her mother reprovingly. "Not everyone has little sisters that are magical witches.""Yes, but not everyone goes out of their way to make their little sisters feel as though they don't belong," said Lily flatly. "You know her better than anyone, Mum – couldn't you try talking to her?""Definitely not," said her mother, looking scandalized. "This is a problem you two must work out for yourselves, after all.""That's going great, isn't it?" said Lily sarcastically. "Listen, Mum, I'll try to keep things civil – and hopefully we'll go from there. I'm more worried about James and Vernon."She raised her eyebrows. "James and Vernon? Why?"Lily pretended to think about it. "Well, for starters, they're both proud, big-headed blokes. You both know what Vernon's like –" her dad snorted " – and James can be really nasty when he wants to –""Nasty?" said her father suddenly, straightening. "Lily, if he –""No, no, no," said Lily hastily, realizing how badly she'd worded that. "Merlin, that sounded wrong. James is very sweet and kind, and we're best friends, even before we started… you know… but he's not going to take an insult laying down, that's what I meant."When her father still looked reproachful, she sighed and said, "Look, Dad. James is one of the best people I know, and he's really protective of the people he cares about. He doesn't really understand the Muggle world – I mean, this world – and if you pair that with Vernon Dursley, who's probably the last person on earth James should be meeting…""It's a recipe for disaster," finished her dad grimly. "Yes, I see what you mean."Her family remained silent as Yukon Cornelius bid the world goodbye and fell off the cliff."Honestly, James, just calm down," implored Marlene as he paced around his room."I am calm," retorted James, trying to push his panic away.It was the 23rd of December, which meant that James would be going out to the Muggle world to have dinner with his scary girlfriend and her scary sister and her even scarier fiancé. The sky outside was cloudless and pink, and specks of dust seemed to dance in the shaft of the late-afternoon sunlight that slanted through the windows. Laying on the bed, watching him in apparent amusement, were Marlene and Sirius.Sirius snorted easily. "Bollocks. You're a nervous wreck, mate, and that's normal.""None of this is normal," said James flatly, ceasing his pacing and sitting down with them. "I'm going to Cokeworth, for Merlin's sake – what the bloody hell am I supposed to do?""What's so bad about Cokeworth?" asked Marlene.James groaned. "It's Muggle, Marly – I don't know the first thing about what Muggles do! I'm going to embarrass her for sure, what was I thinking?""Weren't you the one who hexed Bertram Aubrey because of something he said about disgusting Muggle dogs?"He rubbed circles around his forehead, trying to make his rather intense headache go away. Between Sirius and Marlene, he would be lucky to ever get anything done. Asking help from Remus was not an option, either – he'd left just a few hours ago, saying that he had important matters to attend to and would be back tomorrow morning.Sirius nudged him with his elbow. "A drink, that's what you need. You'll be back to your old self in no time, guaranteed.""I've had enough alcohol to last me the whole winter, Pads," mumbled James, which was true, since most of his nights were spent drinking firewhisky with Marlene and Sirius once they weren't under the watchful eye of his mother."Well, at least get her a gift, you'll look right stupid if you show up without one," said Marlene."But I've already got a Christmas present for her."Marlene appeared to be restraining herself from rolling her eyes."Not a Christmas present, you prat, I meant something separate," she said. "Something like flowers, or… or chocolate.""Yeah," muttered James, "Yeah… a gift…"He groaned again and sprawled on his back, staring blankly at his ceiling. A gift… what would Lily even like?Marlene snorted decisively as though she had heard his thoughts. "Don't go with flowers, though – I've heard firsthand from her that she's sick of getting flowers from boys.""If only Lily could see how desperate you are now," drawled Sirius. James ignored him."I've still got a box of Honeydukes, I'll give her that."Marlene nodded. "Everyone loves chocolate. And also, speaking of gifts – what did you get her for Christmas?"James glanced at his handsomely-wrapped package that was Lily's present, sitting on his desk. "I got her a watch."This time Marlene rolled her eyes disbelievingly. "A watch? Why in Merlin's bloody beard would you get her a watch?""I noticed she hasn't got one," said James defensively, "You know that old tradition where wizards and witches get watches for their seventeenth? I thought it would be nice, since she hasn't got any magical family, and it's even better because she won't be turning eighteen until the end of January! I've been planning this for weeks, I'm giving it to her."Marlene blinked. Perhaps, thought James, she hadn't considered the possibility that he would have put any thought into his gift."I guess if you put it that way…"Sirius beamed at him. "I think it's brilliant. You might even get to shag her, Prongs.""No," said James shortly, scowling at him. "Padfoot, I sometimes wish you didn't have a mouth."His tone of voice did nothing to wipe Sirius's cheeky smile off his face. When his mother called up to them, saying that she needed help with the Christmas tree, they all jumped up from his bed and made their way downstairs.An hour later, after double-checking that his gift had not, in fact, disappeared from the wrapping, and his box of Honeydukes' Best still remained unopened, he opened the door to his room to tell his parents that he was leaving. He was about to go down the stairs when Marlene's voice rang out suddenly from Sirius's room."You're meeting her in that?"James looked down automatically at his clothes. They looked fine to him; obviously, he wasn't going to win any beauty contests, but overall a nice warm jacket and a pair of trousers didn't seem to be cause for any reprimanding.James eyed her dubiously. "Why, what's wrong with it?"Sirius poked his head out from the doorframe, took one look at his clothes and promptly sniggered. "Prongs, I think you're forgetting that you're not just meeting her for a date, you're meeting her sister, too.""Well, what do you suggest I wear, then?" said James indignantly."I dunno," said Sirius, in a tone of voice that suggested he very well did know. "Just wear dress robes, like you would for any other date.""Wouldn't that stand out in the Muggle world?""No," said Marlene in a strangely composed voice. "I heard from Lily and Mary Macdonald that Muggles love to wear exotic clothing, you'll be every girl's wet dream."James snorted. "Appreciate the compliment, McKinnon. I'll go with dress robes."It was a mark of how nervous he was for the evening that he didn't hear two different howls of laughter come from the upper floor that shook the entire manor right before he left.Extremely sorry for the slow updates, this chapter was a breeze to write and due to that I've been putting it off for a couple of days. No excuses, just a lazy author. The next one I've started working on, it's still in its early stages so it probably won't be published until early November. Happy Halloween in advance!

For the first four years of his life, Gale was happy. They lived in a small five room home, just outside of Sevenoaks. His parents were happy.Aurora Blackbriar, his Mum, was an overanxious lady, known in the area for her amazing nature paintings. Her hair was long and dark, shrouding her freckled face from view. Contrasting her hair were her bright blue eyes, which when in the right light appeared to glow.Gale's Dad, Remus Lupin was a taller man, with light brown hair that, despite being in his twenties, had flecks of grey throughout it. He was the only one in the family able to maintain a job, though still found himself fired because of his… problem.Though they had very little to their name, the family was happy, but that changed suddenly."Gale, time to get up."A small boy, with messy russet brown hair, rolled over in a worn twin-sized bed. He buried his freckled face into the bed cushion, wincing when he felt a bent spring jabbed into his leg. With significant effort the boy pulled himself out from under the warm blankets. Stood in the bedroom door was Remus, dressed in a shabby set of muggle clothes."Get up, Mum's made pancakes." Remus told him, then he pulled away from the door and headed down the hall.Gale quickly maneuvered around the small room, practically throwing on clothes, then walked down the hall, though he really wanted to run.Despite the house's overall ramshackle appearance, the interior was warmly lit, with many bright landscape paintings, all done by Aurora, and various family photos, most without Remus.From halfway down the hall, Gale could see both of his parents having an anxious conversation, Aurora kept wringing her hands as she spoke, and Remus was running his hands in his hair. His face held frustrated resignation, his body slouched over slightly, at whatever Aurora said next.Gale's hazel eyes met Remus' amber ones, causing Remus to straighten up and sort of wave Aurora away. She moved over to the petite kitchen and grabbed a few plates, with stacks of pancakes.Gale bolted over to his spot across from his dad."How are you this morning, little cub?" Aurora inquired, as she set the plates down on the table, settling in her own seat on Gale's left.Gale feigned a grimace, "Really tired. Why do you have to go to work so early, Dad?" His gaze shifted completely onto Remus as he faked a whine.A soft chuckle emanated from Remus, "It's a part of having a job. If I could, I would work from home like you two." He shot a quick wink to Gale.A scowl appeared on Gale's face, "Nothing's stopping you." He grumbled, going as far as to moodily cut and stab his syrup-soaked pancakes."Gale Remus Lupin, eat your food, don't play with it." Aurora snapped, "And you Remus John Lupin, I thought you were better than that to know there is no work at the table." Her forest green eyes narrowed at them, but there was a noticeable gleam of amusement in her eyes.The two exchanged feigned surprise, as if they had not expected her to snap, then broke down into laughter. Once the laughter petered out, they settled down and ate the food in front of them, or in Gale's case, eat some of his, then stole some from his parent's plates.Aurora was quick, cleaning the dishes and table, as Remus got ready to leave. Gale moved closer to his father, his whole-body tense and worried, seeing this, Remus knelt before him.He placed a hand on his son's shoulder, "Keep an eye on your Mum, cub. She'll need you while I'm gone." Gale's head lowered.Quietly he asked, "Will you be gone everyday?" Gales eyes fixed themselves to his father's rather nice, if a bit worn, shoes.There was a soft sigh, before Gale was pulled into a warm embrace, "If this goes well, yes, but I will still be home everyday, Cub." he ruffled Gale's hair, then pulled away with a light grin. Gale' gaze lifted to meet his father's. There was a long pause, then Remus stood, patting Gale, on the head, "You cute, Cub."Gale's reaction was adorable. Nose wrinkling and eyes narrowing in a loose approximation of anger, he then huffed and moved away from his father.Aurora laughter filled the small living space, "He's going to start believing you soon." She moved up to Remus and gave him a gentle kiss. She pulled back and began adjusting his suit, "Remus, please stay safe." Aurora said softly, "You know that they aren't all gone."Remus grabbed her hand and lifted it to his lips, "I know, Aurora, I'll be perfectly safe. Keep your wand close." he warned, letting go of her, his gaze shifted to the boy behind her, who was trying to 'sneakily' raid the fridge. "I think you had enough pancakes, Cub."Gale paused, and then proceeded to knock over a lamp, and go tumbling to the floor in a heap. Aurora swiftly turned and picked the lamp up, then began checking over Gale. She sent her husband a nod and watched as he finally exited the small ramshackle house.She easily set Gale in one of the dining chairs, "Next time, wait before scouting for food, Gale." Her eyes were intent, causing Gale to look away guiltily. She shook her head, and leaned forward, "How about you get our supplies together." She pulled away to watch as Gale lit up.He scrambled from his seat, almost falling over in excitement, then bolted into his parent's bedroom. The room was sparsely decorated and filled with a chipped wood bed and creaky greying dresser. Gale opened the middle drawer and began pulling out many painting supplies. Brushes of assorted sizes, with a simple wooden palette, a large Canvas, with a smaller one for him. He dumped it on the bed, then crouched down to retrieve the basic basket that was tucked beneath the bed. Gale pushed the materials into the basket, then maneuvered out of the bedroom.In the living space, Aurora had shifted the table under the window, then had started setting up an antique free-standing easel. She glanced back at Gale, who was struggling to lift the basket high enough to set it on the table. She moved over and helped, then began to unpack the basket. She skillfully set up her own canvas on the easel, then arranged the rest of the supplies out for Gale.The morning went by rather swiftly, as they both painted. Aurora created a beautiful nature scene with a wolf hunting, while Gale painted a simple creature that he claimed was a cat. When the living spaces were brightest, Aurora began to clean up their space, efficiently organising the room around the happily painting boy.Once the area was sufficiently clean to her, she started making sandwiches. The bread was remarkably close to being stale, but besides that the simple meal was good. Slowly, Aurora started doing the chores, making her way through the laundry as Gale played in the half forest, back garden. She was fast, sorting through the clothes, and hanging them, all while keeping an eye on her son as he wandered around.Two hours passed calmly, then a loud crack rang out through the air. Aurora stiffened up, her eyes darting around the environment. As soon as she spotted Gale, she ushered him inside, right into his room. Gale nervously hunkered down in his small closet, as loud voices filled the house."Well, well, well, Amycus… Looks like we have finally found the witch who dared betray the Dark Lord." A harsh, slightly wheezy voice stated. Straining his ears gale could hear them moving around the living area.A mocking male voice quickly joined in the taunting, "Indeed, Sister. Little Aurora will get what is coming for her. As well as that half-breed." They both giggled and began moving around.Gale went still when the sounds of someone outside his door reached him. The person outside stopped right in front of his door.There was a long pause, and the sound of the knob turning, then Aurora shouted, "I won't allow you to touch my home!" something shattered then she let out a sharp scream. The two circled her, that is when Gale made his decision. He cautiously opened his bedroom door and peaked out. Towards the living space, he could see his Mother, and a large puddle of blood, over her was a plump woman, dressed in a dark cloak that obscured her features. He went pale, as he gazed at his mother's form. The Female stood and turned, eyes locking onto Gale."Look at that Brother, a little whelp." the other cloaked individual turned.Gale didn't need much more warning, turning and bolting out the shattered backdoor, down the patio steps, and out into the forest that surrounded the house. He was quicker than the two adults and much smaller. He easily moved through the thick brush and twisted roots. Halfway to his decided destination, he paused leaning against a tree.He took in rapid breaths, jumping at every little twig snap, and the blowing wind."Whelp, where did you go? We planned a nice little party, just for you and you dear Mother."Gale jumped and slipped on a patch of mud, slamming into a rather sharp branch. He let out a loud yelp, as the broken wood dug into his skin. He pushed himself up, eyes never leaving the branch now half protruding from him. His body trembled, and an arm came up to lightly tug at the wood, but he was quick to stop as the pain shot through him.The sound of crunching twigs caught his attention, and he shot to his feet. "Come here kid, my sister didn't mean to scare you." The male voice echoed from a nearby bush.Gale didn't hesitate, fleeing in the opposite direction of the voice.The sun slowly disappeared amongst clouds, just as Gale, stumbled into a small wooden cabin. The outside was weathered, and the door was crooked, and pushing the door open revealed the damaged interior. Inside the simple furniture was ripped and gouged, by what appeared to be claws, and on the wall opposite the door was an old fireplace. Sitting on the mantle was a small vase, only just out of reach for the small four-year-old.Gale shut the door and pushed a rather light side table in front of it, then moved to stare up at the vase. His eyes began to water, and he pulled at his hair hunching over. Which sent a large wave of pain through his form. He straightened up, hoping for the pain to stop, but it didn't.He took in unsteady breaths, as he looked down at the branch still in his chest. Slowly he brought a hand up and grabbed it. Gale's eyes closed, and he took in a deep breath… then yanked it out, sending an enormous, crippling shockwave of pain throughout his entire form. A few tears slipped down his face, but he refused to make a sound.Slowly, and using the broken branch that had once been in him, he knocked the vase down, sending a fair amount of a white powder cascading down to the floor. He sluggishly reached down and grasped a handful of the powder then stepped into the fireplace. He stopped with his hand outstretched, trying to think of someplace that he could go.He threw his hand down, and said as clearly as possible, "Headmaster's Office, Hogwarts." then threw the powder down. Then in a sudden swirl of green fire, he was off. Hurtling past hearth after hearth, barely catching a glimpse of the rooms beyond, until he landed in a tall, cluttered office.He swayed on his feet, eyes barely focusing on the older man sitting at a desk. He was gazing at Gale over a pair of half-moon spectacles, blue eyes filled with understanding. Then Gale collapsed.Gale awoke in a well-lit room, and by his side was his Father. Remus was asleep, clothes stained with dirt and blood, and despite sleeping, he was tense. Off to the side a woman was shuffling some potions around. She turned and immediately caught sight of Gale blinking awake, she quickly made her way over with a tray of potions, handing them to Gale."Drink that darling, it may taste bad, but it'll work wonders." Her voice was soft, as she helped him drink.Each potion tasted worse than the one before, and Gale found himself gagging on the strange earthy flavours. After choking down the disgusting potions, the woman lightly shook Remus awake.He shot up, gaze flicking around the room in panic before they settled on Gale. there was a brief pause, as he assessed his son, then shifted closer. Gale burrowed himself into his father's chest, then finally let himself cry, loud heart wrenching sobs.He knew his mom was gone. If she had been able, she would have been right by his father.The arms around Gale tightened, and he could feel moisture on his head, as well as the shaking of his father's shoulders.Later they would go back to their small five room home, just outside of Sevenoaks. Later they would bury Aurora Alexandria Blackbriar.But right now, they were focused on each other, sitting in the hospital wing of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Shifting among the crowded streets of London was annoying, but definitely necessary. Waiting for someone in that same crowd was borderline impossible. Gale had all but given up on trying to spot his father among the crowd, instead he took to counting the passing cars. One, two, three… and so on."Gale." The amused voice of his dad startled him. His hazel eyes flickered up, and he gave Remus a sheepish smile."Sorry Dad, I got distracted."Remus lightly shook his head, a small chuckle escaping him. He reached out, wrapping an arm around Gale, then moved them forward. It was a rather short walk to the doors of the Leaky Cauldron, it was rather strange to slip into a building that no one appeared to notice, but Gale guessed he would just have to adjust.The two quietly made their way through the establishment, Remus nodded to a few patrons, but nobody Gale recognized. Exiting the backdoor revealed a brick wall, looking over it revealed nothing about what lay beyond it, though Gale was not tall enough to see over it.The two quietly made their way through the establishment, Remus nodded to a few patrons, but nobody Gale recognized. Exiting the backdoor revealed a brick wall, looking over it revealed nothing about what lay beyond it, though Gale was not tall enough to see over it.He watched as his dad drew his wand and tapped one brick decisively. There was a pause, as he drew his wand back in, tucking it away, then the wall opened into an archway. They passed through, and Gale glanced back to watch as the brick arch moved back, as if it had never moved.Remus led the way through the winding street, and Gale found himself watching each building as they passed. Each one was unique, with gravity defying towers and angles.Remus opened the parchment with Gale's school list on it, "Let's start with your cauldron first, Cub." He led them over to a small establishment, with a sign labeled 'Potage's Cauldron shop'. It had large stacks of cauldrons outside, each well kept and glittering in the early morning sun. Gale grimaced as they entered, it was obvious that they kept their better stock outside for passersby to see, as all the cauldrons inside were scratched, bent or rusted.Remus easily picked out the best one and purchased it. He lifted it by the handle, then held it out for Gale, who grasped the pewter nervously.They quickly made their way through Gale's Hogwarts list, relying mostly on second-hand stores to purchase expensive things, like the books and robes.As their visit began to come to a close, Gale couldn't help but point out, "We haven't gotten a wand yet Dad." His hazel eyes watched as Remus smiled in amusement."How about," Remus started, hand settling on Gale's shoulder, "You go to Ollivander's, to go find your wand. I have to go get you something." He smiled at Gale, "A celebratory gift just for you."Gale blinked in surprise, before a small, excited smile spread across his face. He gave a brief nod to his dad, before bolting towards a narrow and shabby looking shop. Its sign read 'Ollivander's' in chipped gold paint.As Gale pushed the door open a tinkling bell echoed throughout the back of the shop. The front was rather small, with a small frail looking chair sitting near the window. Peering past the desk Gale could see the rows and rows of stacked boxes, each one rather slim."Good Morning," an old man with pale eyes, said as he emerged from behind a stack of boxes, startling Gale.Gale subconsciously ducked his head, "H-hello.""Ah, I was waiting far to long to see you, Gale Lupin. You look much like your mother." The man paused for a moment, eyes searching Gale. "A rowan wand with a dragon heartstring core. Twelve and a half inches. A good dueling wand. Does your father still have his wand?"Gale nodded, eyes wide in surprise, it was hard to imagine, remembering people's wands, as well as their faces.Mr. Ollivander nodded, "A cypress, with a unicorn hair core. A reliable one, that one." Mr. Ollivander had moved out of sight now, and the sound of boxes being moved reached his ears. He re-emerged, boxes under one arm and a tape measure in the other. "Please extend your wand arm, Mr. Lupin."Dutifully, Gale extended his right arm, eyes locked on the tape measure as it suddenly shot to his side and began measuring his arm. As it did so, Mr. Ollivander began speaking, "you must remember, Mr. Lupin, no two wands are the exact same, no matter how much they may look it. No one's wand will treat you the same as the wand that chooses you." He then approached with a box in hand, "That will do." He said to the tape measure, then it crumpled to a heap on the floor. "Try this one."In his hand was a simple curved wand, with a simple curved handle. Hesitantly, Gale picked it up."Black Walnut, with a dragon heartstring core. Nine and a half inches. Nice and flexible."Gale held on to the wand for a moment, took a deep breathe, then gave the wand a swish in the air. Before he had finished his movement, Mr. Ollivander had taken it and moved to rummage through the few boxes he had brought forward."Pine, with unicorn hair. Eleven inches. Simple and rigid." The wand he handed Gale was cold to the touch, and when he waved it the chair beside him roared into flame.Gale jumped away from the chair, and hastily set the wand on the counter. Mr. Ollivander just waved his own wand, and the chair was extinguished, looking as if it had never caught fire. Gale watched as Mr. Ollivander shook his head, then turned and wandered back down the stack of boxes, before reappearing with another box in hand. He opened it, then held the box out for Gale.Gale looked between the wand and Mr. Ollivander, apprehension filling his mind. Finally, after a long minute, he took the wand. Holding that wand was vastly different to the other two. This wand filled him with warmth, and a sense of companionship that he had not felt in nearly 7 years. He flicked the wand up, and a bright trail of small white and yellow stars followed its movements.Ollivander smiled, "Well done. Twelve and a quarter inch. Adler with a unicorn hair core. Slightly springy. This wand suggests you are a kind man."Gale nodded absently, as he began examining his new wand. Its handle was carved like a flower bud at the top, with a strange, hooked curve at its base. Two delicate leafy vines were carved into the wood and painted a light natural green.Mr. Ollivander leaned forward, attracting Gale's attention, "That wand will lead you well, Mr. Lupin, trust it."The tinkling bell echoed within the recesses of the shop, as Remus stepped into the shop. He bowed his head as soon as he saw Mr. Ollivander, "Garrick, has he found a wand?"Mr. Ollivander nodded, his pale eyes moving away from Gale. "It will cost 9 Galleons, Remus Lupin."Gale glanced at his father, worried about how much everything was costing, but Remus simply nodded, as he pulled out a small coin purse. He rapidly counted out the money needed, and handed it over, taking the box then extending it to Gale. Taking the hint, Gale tucked his wand back in its box and closing it.As they exited Gale noticed his Father pick up a small animal carrier, "What's in that Dad?" he couldn't help but ask, eyes transfixed on it.His father chuckled, "That is your gift, lets stop at the Ice Cream Parlour, you can open it there."Gale nodded quickly, following his father all the while trying, and failing, to see what was in the carrier.Once they had both settled down with ice cream, Remus lifted the carrier and set it on the table, amber eyes watching Gale, who was trying to eat his Ice cream as quickly as possible."Slow down Gale, you're going to get a brain freeze." He advised, amusement filling his voice. Gale slowed, but he did not pause, even when his father's prediction proved to be true.He finished his ice cream in record time, then pulled the carrier towards him, peering in through the door. The inside was dark, and there was a small mound of cloth against the back. Looking closer Gale could make out his shirt among the cloth, and a small ball of dark fur. Two bright blue eyes opened, and blinked at him, from the darkened carrier.Gale's jaw dropped, and he wrenched open the carrier. He carefully reached in, feeling soft fur beneath his fingers, he gently grasped the creature and pulled it out into the daylight. It was a pitch-black kitten. She simply stared at Gale, as he set her in his lap once there, she stood then placed her front paws on his chest to stare into his eyes.There was a long pause as the two stared at each other, unblinking, until Remus broke the silence."You are much like your mother, so I thought you would like a companion much like hers. She is there should you ever need someone to just listen." He nods at the two, eyes warm, "She just needs a name."Gale watched the young kitten lower herself back into his lap, before crouching down, her butt wiggling in preparation. She leapt up, barely landing on his shoulder, then draped herself across them. She gave a small, very cute, yawn."Alexa, her name is Alexa." Gale said decisively, nodding to his dad.His eyes drifted over to his new companion and smiled.Gale had to go to the train platform alone. Remus had gotten a job offer at a small muggle library, thus he had to leave Gale with a rushed good-bye and quick instructions of how to get on the platform.Kings Cross Station was packed. As it was a fairly busy muggle train station, and a hidden wizard school drop off, it wasn't too terribly strange. There were a few oddities, as some wizards, didn't seem to understand muggle fashion, Gale even saw on man dressed in a pogo shirt, with grey jeans and bright purple suspenders.Gale just made it over to platforms 9 and 10, when another boy, dressed in a worn blue shirt, and stained jeans, bumped his cart."I'm sorry," Gale immediately began, feeling very much out of place in the crowded station, "I didn't see you there."The other boy shook his head, "No, it was my fault." The raven-haired boy looked at Gale's cart, perking up slightly, "Do you know how to get on platform 9 ¾ 's?" He asked.Gale was silent, checking everything the other boy had, then glancing at the snowy owl sat on top his luggage. "Muggle-born?" he asked, tilting his head.The dark-haired boy shrugged, clueless. Gale gave him an understanding nod, knowing that he could just be an orphan from the war. Gale gestured for the boy to follow him.He lined them both up to the brick, in between the two platforms, "All you have to do is go through that wall, don't think about it too hard. If you feel too uncomfortable close your eyes and run." He gave the boy a hesitant nod, then turned and ran at the wall.It was a magnificent, remarkable sight. the large red train was practically glowing. Around it was many people, young and old. Parent readying their kids off, even whole families had come to see off the next generation of Witches and Wizards.Gale tried to shake of his awe and focused on getting his luggage and cat onboard the train. He had to give his dad props, for putting a Feather-light spell on his trunk before they left the house that morning, as lifting the trunk filled with over eight books, up over his head would have hurt.Once everything was secured, Gale let out Alexa, who made a point of sitting on his shoulder, as he tried to find an open seat.He was soon joined by two girls, one a blonde, with eyes that were freakishly large, and the second an average dark-haired girl. Both sneered at his threadbare hand-me-downs, but largely ignored him, as the train began to leave the station.He could hear them muttering across from him. Criticizing his clothing, and his wealth.A soft tapping came from the door, and it opened to reveal an elderly lady, with a large cart of sweets. "Anything from the trolly?" she asked, eyes glancing between the three.Gale got up and pulled out a small handful of sickles, "I'll have two chocolate frogs, please." He requested, body hunching as if to make himself smaller.The lady exchanged the chocolate for his coin, and when it became obvious that the two girls weren't going to get anything, she left. Gale curled up into the seat, barely disturbing the cat on his shoulder, and tucked away his candy. His eyes focused on the passing landscape, watching as trees whizzed by. He sat there, uncomfortably, for hours.As soon as it hit three, Gale stood and pulled out his robes from his trunk. He ignored the rude girls, and moved to the back of the train, where the bathrooms were. Gale locked himself in one, placing Alexa on the edge of the sink, then changing into the robes. He struggled to get the wool vest to sit right, likely because it was a second-hand robe, before giving up and allowing his cat back onto his shoulder.Halfway from his compartment, her couldn't help but overhear a conversation coming from an open compartment."…is it?" a slightly snobbish voice asked.Peering in, Gale could only see the backs of two large boys. A faint yes reached his ears, coming from inside."This is Crabbe, and this is Goyle," the same voice said, carelessly, "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy."A slight snigger echoed from the room.The voice grew angry, "Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford." Gale could stop himself from grimacing. "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.""I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks," another said coolly. Finally, Gale perked up. He recognized that voice, the boy from the platform."I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," the first boy said slowly. "Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like Lestrange, the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you."Gale bit his lip, before moving forward, "Please, stop fighting." His voice came out weak and timid.The boys in front of him turned, revealing a blonde boy with pale blonde hair, who narrowed his eyes at the newcomer. He then scoffed and gestured for his 'friends' to follow him, leaving Gale feeling rather accomplished.A pale girl with reddish-brown hair, poked her head around the door to grin at him, "Thanks, Freckles!" she exclaimed, arm outstretched.Gale tentatively took it, only to be wrenched into the room and pushed onto a seat in front of her."Nova Lestrange." She introduced, with a quick head dip, then she turned to gesture at the two boys in the room."That there is Ronald Weasley," she pointed to a thin redhead, sitting awkwardly, with a box of Bertie Bott's in his hands.She waved her hands to the other boy, "That is my best friend, ever!" She lowered her voice, "THE, Harry Potter."He watched as the boy, Harry, went pink, "Nova, please don't do that." He turned to Gale, "Pleasure to meet you properly."Gale nodded absently, "Gale Lupin…" there was a small pause, "Sorry, Harry Potter? As in the Boy-who-lived?"The group nodded.Gale sat eyes wide, "Wow… that's so cool."Nova was quick to pull him into a small game of I spy, which turned into group story telling. That lasted the rest of the journey, only pausing when the other three needed to change, before quickly starting back up.A voice echoed through the train, as they reached the end of the train ride. "We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately."Looking at his new friends, Gale could see the anxiety and nerves that they were trying to repress. Nova was jumping lightly in place, Ron had gone white, and Harry looked like he was going to be sick.The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Gale breathed in the cold night air, hoping it would calm his nerves. Then Gale noticed a lamp bobbing over the heads of the students."Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?"Holding the lamp, was a large man with an equally large beard, the half-giant groundskeeper, Hagrid, if Gale's memory served him correct."C'mon, follow me — any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!" Slipping and stumbling, the quartet followed Hagrid, and the diverse collection of students, down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. The darkness on the sides of the path, reminded Gale of home, and the way the forest enveloped his home in black."Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here."There was a loud collective "Oooooh!"The tight path had opened onto the edge of a grand black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the opposite side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers."No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats floating in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were the first into a boat, followed quickly by Nova and Gale. "Everyone in?" shouted Hagrid, who needed a whole boat to himself. "Right then — FORWARD!"And the armada of little boats began moving all at once, gliding across the lake, as though it were ice. Everyone was silent, staring in awe at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood."Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff.They were all quick to bend their heads as the boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried through a dark tunnel, which appeared to be taking them right underneath the castle. The stopped at a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door."Everyone here?" When no objections or concerns were raised, Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.The door swung open almost immediately, and a tall, black-haired witch in emerald green robes stood there. Her face was stern, as her eyes drifted across the gather students."The firs' years, Professor McGonagall," said Hagrid."Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here."She opened the door into a large entrance hall. It was astounding, to Gale, all he had known was a 500 sq. ft. house. This could have easily fit three of his houses within it. The stone walls were adorned with simple torches, and looking up, it impossible to make out the ceiling. That was ignoring the magnificent marble staircase opposite them, that led to the upper floors."Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.""The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history, and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.""The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school." Professor McGonagall, regarded everyone, eyes narrowed, "Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and follow me."Gale had thought the Entrance hall was nice, but it had nothing on the Great Hall. Floating about them were candles, thousands upon thousands of candles, keeping the room lit. Just below those candles were long tables, with many students already seated, watching the amazed first-years. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.Gale felt himself grow pale, and his heart quicken. It felt like everyone was staring at him, and in a way they were. He shrunk into himself, as though her were trying to hide for the many eyes that watched the group. There was the sound of shifting, before the room went silent.Gale looked up and followed everyone's gaze, to a rather old hat. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing:"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,But don't judge on what you see,I'll eat myself if you can findA smarter hat than me.You can keep your bowlers black,Your top hats sleek and tall,For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting HatAnd I can cap them all.There's nothing hidden in your headThe Sorting Hat can't see,So try me on and I will tell youWhere you ought to be.You might belong in Gryffindor,Where dwell the brave at heart,Their daring, nerve, and chivalrySet Gryffindors apart;You might belong in Hufflepuff,Where they are just and loyal,Those patient Hufflepuffs are trueAnd unafraid of toil;Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,If you've a ready mind,Where those of wit and learning,Will always find their kind;Or perhaps in SlytherinYou'll make your real friends,Those cunning folk use any meansTo achieve their ends.So put me on!Don't be afraid!And don't get in a flap!You're in safe hands (though I have none)For I'm a Thinking Cap!"The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.Gale felt himself shake as Professor McGonagall stepped forward with a piece of parchment."When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said.Gale went quiet, and he began to run through exercises in an attempt to calm himself, he jerked his head up when he heard Nova's name being called.She was confident, settling on the stool and plopping the hat on, "HUFFLEPUFF!"And then Professor McGonagall called out his name, "Lupin, Gale!"He shakily made his way up to the hat and sat down. As the hat was settled on his head, a voice rang through his mind."Ahh. The heart of a wolf. You could do many good things. No, your mind is you strength, use it well." Then the voice echoed into the hall, "Better be, RAVENCLAW!"Gale slid off his seat, then sat tentatively sat at the cheering table.Maybe School wouldn't be so bad.Oh boy, am I excited. I have been tentatively working on this in the background, and posting the first two chapters feels amazing. GOD.Disclaimer: I own none of Harry Potter and it's affiliates.

The next morning, found Gale curled up under the blankets, while Alexa meowed incessantly beside him. He let out a soft groan and tried to burrow himself under his pillows, but when that didn't muffle Alexa's yowling, he sat up."Why are you so loud?" he muttered, wiping the sleep from him eyes. He then threw the blankets off him and glanced around the room.The dorm went silent, as the black kitten hopped down from the bed and sat in front of a window. Her bright blue eyes focused on Gale, who simple blinked at her.Gale squinted, warily at the other four poster beds in the room. It was odd that none of them were moving, especially with how loud Alexa had been howling. Slowly, Gale stood, and padded quietly over to his cat, then carefully settling down beside her.The black kitten, purred, eyes closing contently. She then turned to look out the window, Gale followed her gaze.Two minutes later, there was a beautiful array of golden light lifting above the horizon. Oranges and reds danced on the clouds, making the shadows appear purple enough to contrast against the darker half of the sky. Gale found himself moving closer to watch as the world came to life.He sat for only a few seconds, after the sun had lifted above the horizon, as then he bolted over to his bed. He rummaged through his clothing and pulled out his robes and awkwardly pulled them on. He pulled his wand out of its box, tucking away into his robes, then grabbed his bookbag.He moved quickly, sparing no attention to the open common room, exiting and descending the stairs. Alexa was right behind him, her tail held high. The two radiated excitement, as they moved, and once they reached the bottom of the tower, Gale had to lean against the wall in order to catch his breath.He glanced down at Alexa, whose blue eyes were on him, "Think we can go find where our classes will be?" He asked her, kneeling down to pick her up. Gale gently settled her on his shoulder, adjusted his bookbag, then went off, hoping to map out the large castle he now called school.Gale learned fast, just how large and maze-like the school could be. He ended up going down the same hall five times, then ended up just outside the great hall. He ran a hand through his hair brows furrowing in complete confusion. How was he meant to navigate for classes? He shook his head, then ducked into the great hall.He hadn't realised how long he had been exploring until he entered. The long tables were occupied by many students, of varying ages, all comfortable in their conversations. Tentatively, Gale moved over to the Ravenclaw table, near to the teacher's table.With great care, Gale began picking out his breakfast, squinting at the few items he had never seen before. He was slow, eating every bite as if it was dangerous, but halfway through his meal, he managed to shake that feeling, and began wolfing down his food.Only ten minutes later, a large group entered the hall, and made their way to the Gryffindor table.Gale shifted, eyes taking in the group, trying to find the friends he made on the train. He must have been focused on the group, because he jumped when a wet paw hit his cheek. Gale whipped around, startled, and stared at a very wet and disgruntled black cat.He snorted, then tried fighting his grin, as he reached over and grabbed a napkin. He had to repress laughter as Alexa, swatted at the napkin, before he caringly began to use his retrieved napkin to dry the wet kitten."Your schedule, Mr. Lupin." Gale extended a hand, as he tried to dry his kitten, as she attacked his napkin. A piece of paper was placed in his hand, so he let the napkin go, and pulled it closer."Thank you." Gale said as he began reading his schedule.He quickly began taking note where his classes would be taken, knowing that would be the hardest part for him, then focused on his food.Classes went by relatively fast; they were startling and Gale struggled to adjust to the social aspect of class.Transfiguration started with the coolest thing. Watching the Stern-faced professor transform from a cat, was amazing, but it she was quick to squash those feelings. They had to take extensive notes, and though Gale was smart enough to be a Ravenclaw, he felt lost throughout her lesson. Then she gave them all Matchsticks and instructed them to transform it into a needle. Many of those in his class managed to affect their matchstick, but Gales had only gone monochromatic.Then was one of the most boring classes ever, History of Magic. It was the only class taught by a ghost, and that was the only interesting thing about it. Professor Binns droned on and on, and Gale had to fight the whole time to stay awake. He managed, but still, his notes were a mess of doodles. Gale resigned himself to reading the material outside of class.Defence Against the Dark Arts, was something everyone talked about, until they took it. Professor Quirrell had stuttered his way through the introduction and through most of the class. Other students began ignoring him, but Gale felt as though he understood the Professor, so he paid attention taking notes seriously.Charms was taught by a tiny wizard, who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk, called Professor Flitwick. Gale felt enthralled, as the class went on, and his notes were perfectly organised, and far more extensive then his even his Transfiguration ones.Then came the worst class, simply because of its teacher. Potions. Gale had been ecstatic at the chance to learn more about potion-making, and he had secretly been hoping to find something in it to prevent werewolf transformations. However, all his hopes were quickly dashed.Potions was in the dark recesses of the castle, aka the dungeons, where it was cooler than the rest of the school, and far creepier. That creepiness was exacerbated by the jars filled with pickled animals, that sat along the walls.Professor Snape, was dressed far darker than any other teacher, and his defining features were his hooked nose and greasy hair.He started the class by reading the register, pausing slightly as he read Gale's name, but continued without note. He finished calling out names and looked over the class. His eyes were dark and cold, and Gale found himself shuddering."You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word. "As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."His eyes focused on Gale's near the end of his speech, sending all of his defenses up. He had no idea why Professor Snape already seemed to hate him, but he had to give him the benefit of the doubt. It might just be how the Professor is."What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?" Professor Snape asked, moving to stand in front of the class.No one raised their hand.Trembling, Gale raised his hand eyes wide.The Professor's eyes narrowed, "Mr. Lupin." He practically sneered.He swallowed nervously, "Asphodel and wormwood, when combined make an extremely powerful sleeping potion known as the Draught of Living Death. The potion is well known for being a difficult one to make-"Professor Snape cut him off, "Yes, it is. Now since you appear to be the only one willing to contribute, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?"Gale blinked, eyes going distant as he tried to quickly recall what he had read, "Bezoar's are removed form the stomach of a goat and are an antidote to most poisons." He grew nervous as the Professor moved closer to his desk."And,what is the difference, Mr. Lupin, between monkshood and wolfsbane?" His voice had gone deceptively soft."They are both the same, sir." Gale practically whispered, feeling freaked out. He hands began shaking beneath his desk.Professor Snape straightened up, and cast a look around the room, "They also go by the name of aconite, Lupin. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?" He snapped at the other students, turning with a flick of his robes.There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, "And two points will be given to the Ravenclaw House."From there it went down hill. The class was paired up, Gale being accosted by a concerned Nova, and told to mix up a simple potion to cure boils. He patrolled the rows as everyone focused on their potions, However Gale had quickly handed Nova the tools, as his hand were shaking so bad."Are you okay?" She murmured, as she focused on crushing the snake fangs.Gale nodded, "I think I will be. Thanks for being my partner."She sent him a smile, "No need to thank me, we're friends, aren't we?" He returned her smile, just as Professor Snape drifted by."Eyes on you work, Lestrange." His black eyes swept over Gale, "And you should be doing work as well, Lupin, not sitting there watching everyone else. Five points from Ravenclaw."He continued past the two, and Gale noticed the many glares of his fellow Ravenclaw's. He felt himself sink in his seat. He pulled his book closer to him, and began to carefully instruct Nova, as he began to stir the potion.The rest of the class continued, with Nova occasionally sending him worried looks, until they finished.As they trudged up the stairs, Nova linked arms with him and pulled him along. The exuberant red-head easily navigated the crowds, before plopping them both in front of Harry and Ron."I know you said Snape was an Arse, but He is way worse." She started, leaning forward.Harry jerked, looking at her frantically, "Did he insult you?" he asked Nova, who rolled her eyes."No you prat, He practically assaulted Gale, just because he was able to answer so bizarre questions, then he bullied him, because freckles was unable to hold a knife."Gale's brows furrowed, "He didn't bully me because I was unable to hold anything, Nova."She scoffed, throwing herself into Gale. She gave him a stern look, "Maybe not, but it certainly felt like it."Ron nodded, "He was a real… umm…" he stopped as he looked over the two. Nova whirled around, eyes already narrowed, and gale felt himself turn just to see.Standing a mere two feet away was Draco Malfoy, clutched in his hands was a familiar black cat. Gale found himself moving over, along with Nova, who had seemingly decided he needed a guard."This is yours; I presume." Draco half-heartedly sneered, thrusting Alexa forward. She didn't make a noise of protest, despite the movement.Gale nodded, arms coming out to take her, "Thank you, where was she?" He asked, he hadn't even noticed her leaving his side during any of his classes.Draco's eyes flicked off to the side, "None of your business, Lupin." His attempted barb felt rather tame.Gale tightened his grip on the kitten, sending Draco a smile. The blonde flushed slightly, looking a bit panicked, then quickly moved off to his table. Nova just looked back and forth; head tilted in thought.A few weeks pasted, similarly to the first, except now he was hanging out with Nova, Harry and Ron. The other boys were quick to include Gale, despite him not being into the same things.During this time Professor Snape got worse, snipping at him for no reason, and Harry and Gale both shared each experience they had with the rude teacher.Then came flying lessons, Ron had told Nova and Gale everything, long before the raven haired boy had appeared, even though it was hard to follow because of the food in his mouth."I mean, technically Harry was in the wrong, but Professor McGonagall is a fair teacher, she'll listen to Harry." Gale cautiously said.Ron blinked at him, "What, he was not in the wrong! He was helping Neville, besides Malfoy should be punished at least."Nova sighed, "He didn't mean that Harry wasn't doing a good thing, he was just stating that according to the Professor, he should have stayed on the ground."Gale nodded, smiling lightly, "And I think Draco does deserve some sort of punishment as well." Ron nodded, seemingly in thought, before he pointed at Gale."Why do you call Malfoy by his first name?""Because it's his name?" Gale tensed, looking nervous."But he's a prat."Gale relaxed slightly, "And?" He sighed lightly, "Name calling isn't a punishment, and beyond that he hasn't done anything to me, so I don't feel like I need to change how I refer to, or talk to him."Ron jabbed his fork into his food, "You've though about that, before."Gale simply shook his head, smiling, as he took a sip of his chocolate milk. Nova grinned then glanced over to the doors of the great hall. She hopped from her seat and waved over a happy looking Harry."How was your punishment?" Gale asked, knowing by the how happy he appeared, Harry hadn't been punished at all.Quickly Harry told them about how instead of being put in detention, he had been placed on the Gryffindor quidditch team."Your joking!" Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it. "Seeker?" he said. "But first years never… you must be –""The youngest house player in about a century," said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. "Wood told me."Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. "I start training next week," said Harry. "Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret."Nova was bouncing in her seat, eyes wide.Gale on the other hand looked contemplating, "Quidditch is a dangerous sport. Are you sure you're ready Harry?" he asked.Harry nodded, as he finished the bit in his mouth, "It's not like I'll be going unsupervised. I have the rest of the team, and…" He reached out to grab another Shepard's pie, "The whole school will be at the games themselves."Gale nodded, "At least you've thought about it," He remarked, nibbling on a biscuit, "not many would, given the circumstances."Harry smiled, "I knew that you would worry, so I thought about it."Nova awed, "Look at that Freckles, you matter to him." She teased.Harry threw a half-eaten biscuit at her, she grinned, before swooping up the discarded food and chomping down on it. Gale grimaced, as he finished his own biscuit. His eyes wandered over the tables nearby, before the group continued conversing."Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?" Draco approached the four, flanked by his two rather large companions, that Gale still didn't know the names of."You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you," said Harry coolly, focusing on his food."I'd take you on anytime on my own," said Malfoy. "Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only - no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?""Of course he has," said Ron, wheeling around. "I'm his second, who's yours?"Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up."Crabbe," he said. "Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked."When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other."What is a wizard's duel?" said Harry. "And what do you mean, you're my second?"Nova smacked Ron over the head, "You can't just accept a duel for someone else, you prat." She scowled, "Besides I'm always Harry's back up."Gale glanced at Harry who was looking over the two, as the two quickly devolved into an argument.He leaned over, "A Wizard's duel is what it says, a duel between wizards, though it is a bit sexist. Typically, a wizard's duel lasts until one of the opposing wizard's die, as well as their second, or they are incapacitated. The second is basically there if the primary wizard, so you in this case, falls." Gale stopped to take in Harry's face, "Don't be too worried, you both only eleven, I can't image either of you doing to much damage.""And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?""You could punch him," Nova commented her eyes stilled focused on Ron, who looked rather terrified."Excuse me."They all looked up. It was a brunette with thick bushy hair, dressed in immaculate Gryffindor robes."Can't a person eat in peace in this place?" said Ron.Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. "I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying -""Bet you could," Ron muttered."-and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. It's really very selfish of you.""And it's really none of your business," said Harry."Good-bye," said Ron.Nova gave a fake smile, and a small salute. Gale nodded to her. The brunette was quick to move away, sensing everyone's lack of enthusiasm."Who was that?" Gale asked.The other three exchanged looks and laughed.As soon as Gale arrived at breakfast, he beelined it over to the two Gryffindors, and one Hufflepuff, sitting at the Ravenclaw table."Why are we sitting here today?" Gale asked, as he grabbed some toast.Nova leaned back and made a show of looking around, "Hmm, because it's the emptiest table…"Gale paused, "Something happened last night." He stated, suddenly feeling tired. The three nodded. With a sigh Gale, gathered more food onto his plate, then gestured to them.Harry was the first to start, "We went out, for the duel Malfoy challenged me to, and we saw something.""First, it was a set up!" Nova sulked, "He set Filch on us.""The grumpy caretaker?" Gale asked."No," Nova remarked, "The painter. Yes, the caretaker." She snapped."Easy, Nov." Harry consoled, "We hid, in order to avoid being caught. Turns out we hid in the forbidden room on the third floor."Gale glanced up curiously, "What was in it?" he asked."Granger, the bush hair girl, saw a trapdoor, but everyone else was focused on the gigantic three-headed dog!" Nova gestured, as if to show it's size, "It was huge, and it growled at us. I think it was really cool."Gale pushed his plate away, "Wait there's a Cerberus here!" he looked slightly panicked, "But why, they are really dangerous. Why would Professor Dumbledore let anyone bring in a creature like that, especially into a school."Nova shrugged, eyes bright.Harry grinned at them, "If Granger did see a trapdoor, I think I know what's under it.""What?" Gale asked, scratching his head."Whatever Hagrid took from vault seven hundred and thirteen.""It's either really valuable or really dangerous," said Ron."Or both," Harry said, pointedly.The rest of the week pasted without incident. The four attempted to figure out what the object from Gringotts was, but as all harry could remember was its approximate length, two inches, they had little hope of solving the mystery without any more clues.The other three began to focus on getting back at Draco, which they planned, as Gale did homework, only occasionally stopping to suggest ideas.About a week later, as the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Gale watched with confusion, trying to figure out whom the package was for, when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of Harry, knocking his bacon to the floor, with another owl dropping a letter on top of the parcel.Harry swiftly ripped open the letter first and had difficulty hiding his glee at what he read. He handed the note to Nova, who quickly handed it to Ron, to read.Gale was handed the note, quickly reading what the others had:DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session. Professor McGonagall Gale shook his head and gave the others a wave, as he continued eating his food. the three all sent him wide, but confused grins, before bolting out of the great hall to open the package.Gale turned to look up at the remaining owls, then watched as a small worn barn owl landed before him, a letter attached to its leg. Gale untied the letter, and opened the letter, ignoring the owl as it took off.Dear Gale,I have found a temporary job working as a librarian in a nearby muggle town. It pays well enough, but I doubt it will last past my next transformation. Roxana was the one who recommended me.I hope you remember Roxana, though it has been many years since you've seen, her. She has been helping me around the house, but I have noticed her getting antsy, so I don't expect her to be her much longer.How have your classes been, cub? I assume that you have sprouted off the dictionary definition for many topics, but I do hope you haven't had any trouble with them, or the teachers. Is Professor McGonagall still teaching?Please write, cub, as I find myself missing your silliness. Reassure you dear old dad.With love and plenty of fur,Remus Lupin.

The next few weeks flew by, and Gale had found himself writing many letters for his father and helping his friends with their schoolwork. He was beyond glad that he had found a family that didn't appear to care that he had no money.The lead up to Halloween filled the quartet with excitement, mainly from Nova. On Halloween morning Gale was greeted with the familiar scent of pumpkin spice, which infiltrated every nook and cranny of the school. Even better, Professor Flitwick taught them to levitate objects.Gale was in a fantastic mood, when he joined the group in the great hall, which went crashing down when Nova and Harry told him what Ron had done.Gale shook his head, baffled, "Why?""I mean, is what I said wrong?" Ron asked, looking extremely awkward.Gale gaped at him, even as Alexa hopped from his shoulder, and moved over to scratch Ron."Oww, you bloody cat!" He yelped, pulling away from the calm black cat, "Control her." Ron snapped.Gale shook his head, "You bleeding deserve it, I'm an awful lot like her Ron." He pointed out, as he reached for a biscuit, then dropped it in his gravy."You don't act like a know-it-all." Ron stated.Gale was quick to retort, "I have anxiety." He sent the red head a sharp look.Ron wrinkled his nose and turned to his food.Nova shook her head, and reached out to grab a jacket potato, at the same time as Harry. Mere seconds later, Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.Everyone turned to stare as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped out, "Troll - in the dungeons - thought you ought to know."He then sank to the floor, having fainted.Everyone in the hall began to freak out, it took quite a few attempts for Professor Dumbledore, with help from magical purple firecrackers, to make everyone go silent."Prefects, lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!"Just down the table, one of Ron's brother's stood, "Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!""How could a troll get in?" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs."Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid," said Ron. "Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke."They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm, and turned to Nova, and Gale who was just about to re-join his house."I've just thought - Hermione.""What about her?""She doesn't know about the troll." Ron bit his lip. "Oh, all right," he snapped. "But Percy'd better not see us."Gale nodded, and the quartet carefully joined the Hufflepuffs. They ducked down an empty corridor and began their way to the Girl's bathroom.They had barely turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them."Percy!" hissed Ron, pulling Harry and Nova behind a large stone griffin.Gale had to quickly follow, feeling his adrenaline spike. Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Professor Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view."What's he doing?" Harry whispered. "Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?""Search me."As quietly as feasibly possible, they crept along the next corridor, following the Professor's fading footsteps."He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held up his hand."Can you smell something?"Gale took a deep breath, then grimaced. The air was filled with the rancid smell of old food, and dirty clothes. Then, just down the hall, they saw it.It was twelve feet tall, skin a lifeless, granite gray, it's great lumpy body like a boulder with a small bald head perched on top. Its legs were short and thick as tree trunks with flat feet. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were too long.The group tucked themselves among the shadows, hoping that the troll wouldn't see them. It stopped by a doorway and peered inside. Its long ears wiggled as it thought, remarkably hard, then it slowly hunched down so it could get in the room."The keys in the lock," Harry muttered. "We could lock it in.""Good idea," said Ron nervously."No, That's a terrible idea." Nova hissed, squinting at them, "That's the girls' bathroom!"The boys all exchanged looks, then Harry took off. With the others not far behind. He wrenched the door open, and they rushed in.Hermione was cowering against the wall opposite them, looking as if she was about to be sick, or faint. The troll was slowly advancing on her, knocking everything over, stall, sinks, mirrors, as it went."Confuse it!" Harry said desperately to the others, then swooped down to grab a broken tap, he then threw it as hard as he could against the nearby wall.Gale quickly bolted around the room, finding the safest path to Hermione, and grabbing her arm.The troll stopped, turning its head to find the source of the noise, spotting Harry. It paused, before it began lumbering towards Harry instead."Oy, pea-brain!" yelled Ron, from his new position on the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly head toward Ron instead.Gale took the opportunity and began to pull Hermione past the troll, the two slipping on the wet floor as they moved over broken sinks."Come on, run, run!" Harry yelled at the two, as Nova tossed another tap at the troll.The shouting in the echoing bathroom seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It howled and started toward Ron, who was nearby and had no way to escape.Gale pulled Hermione over to the door, and turned, only to watch as Harry jumped and barely managed to hook his arms around the troll's neck, hanging from behind. The troll probably wouldn't have noticed if it hadn't been for Harry's wand, which had been jabbed up it's nose.Screaming in pain, the troll twisted and flailed, its club flying around with little purpose, and Harry clinging for dear life.Both Nova and Ron pulled out their wands, but Nova hesitated, which let Ron cry out the first spell that came into his head."Wingardium Leviosa!"With that, the club suddenly flew out of the troll's hand, and rose high, high up into the air. Slowly it turned over, and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. They all watched as the troll swayed on the spot and then fell, flat on its face, with a bang that made the whole room shudder.Gale stared wide-eyed at the unconscious form, feeling a small grin start to spread across his face.It was Hermione who spoke first."Is it - dead?""I don't think so," said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out.""Oh, definitely, trolls have thick skulls, both literally and figuratively." Gale said, as he looked over the room.Nova padded over to them, "Ron knocked out a troll." She stated.Gale grinned, as Ron let out a huff of laughter.They all jumped, as a loud slamming and noisy footsteps made their way to them.A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come surging into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a slight whimper, and sat quickly down on one of the few intact toilets, clutching his chest.While Snape bent over to examine the troll, Professor McGonagall was looking at the quartet. Her face was filled with anger, with white lips."What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice.Gale stared blankly at her, barely registering the question, as the others looked between themselves."You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your dormitory?" She snapped, eyes looking over them.Snape gave Harry and Gale matching, piercing looks. Gale felt himself, shrinking, and he could feel his hands start to quiver."Please, Professor McGonagall. They were looking for me.""Miss Granger!""I went looking for the troll because I, I thought I could deal with it on my own, you know, because I've read all about them." Hermione stood, eyes nervous, as she lied to the Professor. "If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived."The others attempted to look as though this wasn't new to them, but Gale was certain it was an obvious lie."Well - in that case..." said Professor McGonagall, staring at the five of them, "Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?" Hermione hung her head. "Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this. I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses."Professor McGonagall turned to look at the other four. "Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win five points for your house. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go."Gale swallowed, as the group hurried out of the room. Gale was the first to leave them, heading straight for his dorm. He approached the door and stopped before the eagle knocker."When the wolves howl and owls awake it is visible in the sky?"Just as he was about to answer, a soft mew echoed from behind him. Gale turned and spotted Alexa, who calmly padded to his side.He looked at the knocker, "The full moon.""Correct." Then the door swung open.As silently as possible, Gale moved past the eating Ravenclaw's and bolted into his dorm room.When November came around, snow began to lightly cover the world outside. On Sunday of the quidditch game, Gale was carefully making his way to breakfast, when Nova accosted him. Linking her arms with his, she pulled him over to a nook by the great hall entrance.Nova looked concerned, "Are you okay?" Gale tentatively nodded, and she continued, "We've noticed you pulling away from us, and we were concerned. Still are actually.""I'm fine, I just." Gale paused, "You go looking for trouble… I can't handle throwing myself into danger every other week." He said, quietly ducking down."You don't have too. You're the brains here."He shook his head, "You have Hermione, she's the top of our year."Nova shoved him into the wall, "You say that as if she knows everything, you prat."Gale pulled away, looking sadly at Nova, "Look, I just can't handle what you guys get into. See you in class." He began to briskly walk away."That's it, you're just going to give up!" Nova shouted after him.Gale ducked his head down, and quickly found an open spot at the Ravenclaw table. He was joined by an older boy, with a mess of dark brown hair, he smiled warmly at Gale."First-year, right?" he asked, confidently.Gale nodded, pulling his plate closer, then looking closely at the boy.He was a fair amount taller than Gale, with a very athletic build, accentuated by his snug t-shirt. His face was sharp and fairly well defined, despite his age, and his eyes were a beautiful ocean blue.Gale swallowed nervously, then flushed.The older boy nodded, seemingly unaware of Gale looking him over, "My name's Colby, beater on the our Quidditch team."Gale nodded; eyes focused intently on his food."You okay?"Gale gulped, "Yeah, I'm fine, I'm going to the library."Colby looked taken aback, "And miss watching THE Harry Potter in action?" He shook his head, "Come on kid, you're coming." Gale didn't protest, resigned to being forced around by another. He managed to grab some of his research books on Werewolves, at ten, just before Colby grabbed his arm and dragged him to the pitch.Gale hunkered down beside the older boy, pulling out one of his books."Oh, pay attention," Colby said, pulling the book from Gale's hands, "You'll enjoy this." He gestured to the game, as the whistle went off.Gale leaned forward, as fifteen brooms rose up into the sky. The game had started."And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor - what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too -""JORDAN!""Sorry, Professor. And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve - back to Johnson and - no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes - Flint flying like an eagle up there - he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle - that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and - OUCH - that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger - Quaffle taken by the Slytherins - that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger - sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which - nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes - she's really flying - dodges a speeding Bludger - the goal posts are ahead 149 - come on, now, Angelina - Keeper Bletchley dives - misses - GRYFFINDORS SCORE!"Gale smiled, perking up as loud cheers from the Gryffindor stands filled the air, drowning out the coming from the Slytherins. His gaze flicked up to Harry, who was watching the game from above, while lazily circling the pitch.Gale kept his eyes on Harry, feeling himself go tense when Harry took off towards something. Then a Slytherin blocked him, causing the many Gryffindor's to let out exclamations of rage.Lee Jordan, the commentator, was finding it difficult not to take sides."So - after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating.""Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall."I mean, after that open and revolting foul.""Jordan, I'm warning you -""All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession."As Harry dodged a Bludger, Gale noticed something strange. Harry's broom had given him a sudden, alarming lurch. For a split second, Gale was terrified that his friend would fall.It happened again. It was almost like his broom had bucked. Gale tried to ignore it, but as Harry went haphazardly zigzagging through the air, Gale found it completely stupid to ignore.Lee was still commentating, nonplussed."Slytherin in possession - Flint with the Quaffle - passes Spinnet - passes Bell - hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose - only joking, Professor - Slytherins score - A no..."It appeared as though one else had noticed that Harry's broom was being erratic. Slowly, Harry moved higher and higher, as the broom jerked and twitched, climbing steadily.Gale felt himself stand, as he squinted up at Harry. It was possible…Gale's gaze snapped to the crowd, just as people began pointing out Harry's situation. Carefully, his eyes darted over everyone, until they landed on the teacher's stand. Professor Quirrell and Professor Snape were both looking at Harry.Gale, ignored Colby's protests, as he left, maneuvering carefully around the surrounding students, until he stood only feet away from the teachers. From where he stood, Gale could see Hermione, as she raced past Professor Quirrell, sending him headfirst into the row before him. She reached Snape and pointed her wand at his robes, and bright blue flames shot from her wand to the fabric of Professor Snape's robes.It took a few seconds for Professor Snape to realize that he was on fire. He let out a startled yelp and leapt to his feet. Gale watched as she bolted back, running fully into him.The two went crashing down into the wooden stands, and they both stared wide-eyed."I'm sorry!" Hermione yelped, lurching to her feet. She offered a hand, which Gale gladly took."It's partially my fault, for just being here," He joked, weakly.Hermione snorted, "Are you coming with?" she asked, taking a small step away.Gale paused, thinking about how he was very willing to do something similar to her just prior. He gave a determined nod. The two made their way over to Ron, Nova and Hagrid, just as Harry landed."He won!" Nova shouted, bouncing excitedly.The group made their way down, and Harry joined them. Each getting a strong cup of tea at Hagrid's hut."It was Snape," Ron explained, "Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you."Gale shook his head, "It was either Professor Snape or Professor Quirrell, both showed signs of wandless magic.""It was Snape," Ron stated, boldly.Nova rolled her eyes but made no comment. Acting like Gale had never spoken."Rubbish," said Hagrid, "Why would Snape do somethin' like that?"Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth."I found out something about him," he told Hagrid. "He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding."Hagrid dropped the teapot."How do you know about Fluffy?" he said."Fluffy?""Yeah, he's mine, bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year - I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the…""Yes?" said Harry eagerly."Now, don't ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. "That's top secret, that is.""But Snape's trying to steal it.""Rubbish," said Hagrid again. "Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort.""So why did he just try and kill Harry?" cried Hermione.The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape."I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!""I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!" said Hagrid hotly. "I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all of yeh - yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel -""Aha!" said Harry, "so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?"Hagrid looked furious with himself.Despite the cold of December coming up, the group found themselves hiding away in the school library.Nova still refused to acknowledge Gale, which Harry told him was because she was scared, he'd leave. Uncertain how to prove he wouldn't just leave, Gale wrote to his father about staying for Christmas, and he threw himself into research.He had heard of the name Nicolas Flamel, in fact, both Hermoine and him had heard the name, but neither could remember where. The two slogged through Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, Notable Magical Names of Our Time, Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. The two were getting increasingly frustrated, by the lack of information.Nova was the first to notice when Harry left the library, and thus their research time had ended. The four approach him shaking their heads. They went off to get lunch."You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?" said Hermione. "And send me an owl if you find anything.""And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is," said Ron. "It'd be safe to ask them.""Very safe, as they're both dentists," said Hermione."I might be able to ask Tonks." Nova piped up, "but I wonder if because she's training to be an Auror, if she couldn't."Once the holidays started, Gale found himself wrapped up in the environment to think about Flamel. Instead he found himself wandering the snow-covered grounds, he even contemplated trying to skate on the frozen lake, but quickly ruled that out, for his own safety.He wandered around hoping to find a nice area to settle, as he was tired of being burdened with many books, a blanket and a cat. Once he decided on a place, he rolled out the blanket, and sat on it. Alexa stayed perched on his shoulder, as he began to go through the many werewolf books he had brought with him.Despite the cold, Gale stayed there for many hours. Flipping carefully through each book and taking many detailed notes in a separate notebook. He had to be incredibly careful, in order to not get snow on the books but he managed."Lupin." The sudden voice of Draco startled him from his work.Gale looked up, blinking at the strangely overdressed boy. Gale had dress in a thick coat and a warm hat, but Draco was practically a marshmallow."Why are you dressed like that?" he asked, glancing at the cat on his shoulder.Draco grimaced, "Nevermind, then." The blonde turned away, and began leaving, only to pitch forward into the snow.Gale set his books to the side and moved over to check on him. Draco scowled at Gale, who simply smiled, and offered a hand. Draco reluctantly accepted and was pulled to his feet, then Gale moved back to his blanket, and collected his stuff."You can tell me as we walk." Gale said quietly, as he re-approached Draco.Draco flushed, but followed Gale."I was just wondering why you are out here alone." Draco muttered.Gale ran a hand over his hat, "I wanted to do some research without interruptions.""I'm sorry."Gale looked at Draco, "Pardon?""I'm sorry." Draco snapped, irately.Gale shook his head, "You didn't really interrupt me, Draco. I got a lot done, I do need breaks, ya' know." He grinned.Draco sniffed, then sped up, leaving Gale alone.He tilted his head closer to Alexa, "It's rather odd, isn't it? He seems rather nice without Harry or his friends around. I wonder why?"Alexa let out an annoyed mewl in response.

The rest of the break went by with little to note. Gale got a wolf pocket watch, that showed both the time and moon phase, for Christmas. He ate a lot of food, and Nova dragged him over to the Gryffindor table, where they all played games, like Wizard's chess.When Hermione got back, she was irritated that none of them had found out who Nicolas Flamel was. Gale cited Christmas as an excuse, leading to Hermione dragging him into the library for several hours.A month went by, before they made their big discovery. Gale had just settled down beside Nova, when Hermione slammed a large book onto the table in front of him."I told the Harry and Ron this last night, we found Nicolas Flamel." She leaned over and flipped the book open, "Read this."Gale obediently leaned over to read; The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight)."Bleeding heck, he's old." Nova muttered, before shoving a bun into her mouth."The dog must be guarding Flamel's Philosopher's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!"Gale nodded, "A stone that prevents you from dying, I can see why someone would want that."Nova swallowed her food, "So Snape want's to live forever? God, he's a vampire."Gale and Hermione shared an amused look.During potions, Gale found himself pondering what he would do with a Philosopher's stone, probably cure his father. He was ripped from his thoughts when Nova kicked him."Owww…" He hissed, glaring at her, "Why'd you do that?"She cocked an eyebrow, "Maybe because you're off in la la land, during potions." Her voice was dry.Gale grimaced, lowering his gaze to his paper, just as Professor Snape appeared."Not doing your work, Lupin?" The Professor's dark eyes swept over Gale's relatively blank parchment, "Ten points from Ravenclaw." He then breezed by.Nova glared harshly at the teacher's back, "I wish he would die.""Nova." Gale said warningly, as he filled his paper."Am I wrong?"Gale simply rolled his eyes and focused on his work.Next Quidditch game approached was filled with anxiety. Harry was worried because Professor Snape was the referee, and Gale was terrified that Harry's broom would try and murder him.The quartet said wished Harry luck, before going up in the stands to find their place."Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis," Hermione muttered to the others."I know," Ron snapped. "Don't nag."Nova went out of her way to elbow Ron in the gut, "Sorry!" she apologised falsely."Nova!" Both Hermione and Gale chastised, sharing exasperated looks."I've never seen Snape look so mean," Ron commented. "Look -they're off Ouch!"Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head.It was Draco."Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there." Draco grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. "Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?"Ron didn't answer as Snape awarded Hufflepuff a penalty. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was peering attentively at Harry, who was orbiting the game like a hawk."You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?" Draco said loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff yet another penalty with no reason. "It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money - you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains."The boy just next to Nova went bright red but turned in his seat to face Draco."I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy," he stammered.Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Nova, not daring to take her eyes off Harry, said, "You tell him, Neville.""Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something."Ron snapped, without looking "I'm warning you, Malfoy - one more word""Ron!" said Hermione suddenly, "Harry -""What? Where?"Gale leaned forward to watch as Harry went into a steep dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the surrounding crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry sped toward the ground."You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!" Draco sneered.Ron snapped. Before anyone knew what was occurring, Ron was on top of him, grappling him to the ground. The other boy next to Nova hesitated, then scrambled over the back of his seat to help."Come on, Harry!" Hermione screamed, leaping out of her seat to watch as Harry zoomed straight at Professor Snape. Both her and Gale watched transfixed, as Nova hurried over to help the flailing mess of limbs behind them.Up above, Professor Snape turned on his broomstick just in the nick of time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches. Then Harry had pulled out of his dive, an arm raised in triumph with a small flashing piece of clasped within his hand.The stands erupted into gleeful shrieking."Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!" shrieked Hermione, bouncing up and down in her place then turning and hugging Gale beside her.The two grinned, then turned to the pile of red and green behind them. Nova had Draco in a head lock while Ron and the other boy, Longbottom Draco called him, were bruised but standing over Draco's friends in triumph.Gale rubbed his face.The three managed to get out of punishment, and the quartet, because Neville Longbottom had collapsed, made their way down to find Harry.It was getting dark when Nova pointed out a figure with a cloak over their head. The four rushed over to join him, as they walked up to the castle."Harry, where have you been?" Hermione squeaked."We won! You won! We won!" shouted Ron, smacking Harry's back."And I gave Draco a black eye, Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He's out cold but Madam Pomftey says he'll be all right! Talk about showing Slytherin!" Nova bounced over to link arms with Harry."Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens." said Ron."Never mind that now," said Harry nervously. "Let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this..."Harry quickly scoped out an empty room, deeming it right the turned and closed the door."So we were right, it is the Philosopher's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocus- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through -""So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?" said Hermione in alarm."It'll be gone by next Tuesday," said Ron.Gale bit his tongue, "I mean, let's assume every teacher placed some sort of enchantment. Does Professor Snape know what everyone did?" The other shrugged., Gale ran a hand through his hair, "Let's be optimistic, yeah?"Quirrell, it turns out, was a lot braver than any of them had thought, though in the following weeks he did appear to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd broke yet.Despite the importance of their discovery, Gale found himself absorbed into schoolwork. Him and Hermione had started comparing notes, and carefully colour-coding them by importance to the class. Gale had managed to get Harry to start studying for exams as well, but Ron and Nova were a lot harder to convince."Hermione, the exams are ages away." Ron whined."Ten weeks," Hermione snapped. "That's not ages, that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel.""But we're not six hundred years old," Nova reminded her.Ron nodded, "Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it all.""What is she studying for? Are you crazy? We need to pass these exams to get into the second year?" Gale exclaimed, looking up from his reading."They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me..." said Hermione.Unfortunately for them, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same line. They piled the homework on them, so much that Easter holidays became a study week for the whole quintet."I'll never remember this," Ron burst out one afternoon, chucking his quill and staring longingly out of the library window.Gale didn't even react, as he flipped through his notes on Transfiguration."Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?" Gale looked up, and they all watched as Hagrid shuffled into view, obscuring something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his worn out overcoat."Jus' lookin'," he said, in a suspicious voice that peaked everyone's interest at once. "An' what're you lot up ter?" He looked suddenly suspicious. "Yer not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?""Oh, we found out who he is ages ago," said Ron impressively. "And we know what that dog's guarding, it's a Philosopher's St -""Shhhh!" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. "Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?""There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact," said Harry, "about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy -""SHHHH! Listen - come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh -""See you later, then," said Harry. Hagrid shuffled off."What was he hiding behind his back?" said Hermione thoughtfully. "Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?""I'm going to see what section he was in," said Ron. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms, letting them fall to the table in a clatter"Dragons!" he whispered. "Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide.""Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, " said Harry."But it's against our laws," said Ron.Gale nodded rapidly, "Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, every witch and wizard knows that.""It's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania.""But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?" said Harry."Of course there are," said Ron. "Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget.""So what on earths Hagrid up to?" said Hermione.Nova let out a small squeak, and they all glanced over. She was asleep on top of her notes. Her quill dripping ink onto the table as she slept. Gale stood and carefully cleared up her space, hoping that Madam Pince would not see the mess the ink had made.He cast a look at the trio, "We'll find out when we go talk to him, I'm sure."When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed.Hagrid called "Who is it?" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused."So - yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?""Yes," said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. "We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from Fluffy."Hagrid frowned at him."0' course I can't," he said. "Number one, I don' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That Stone's here fer a good reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy.""Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here," said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. "We only wondered who had done the guarding, really." Hermione went on. "We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you."Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry, Nova and Ron beamed at Hermione, while Gale just tilted his head in thought."Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let's see... he borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o' the teachers did enchantments... Professor Sprout - Professor Flitwick - Professor McGonagall -" he ticked them off on his fingers, "Professor Quirrell - an' Dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.""Snape?""Yeah - yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it."Gale sent the others a concerned look. If Professor Snape, or Professor Quirrell, because Gale wasn't ruling him out just yet, were involved with protecting the stone, then they muse know how the others protected it."You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren't you, Hagrid?" said Harry anxiously. "And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?""Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore," said Hagrid proudly."Well, that's something," Harry muttered to the others. "Hagrid, can we have a window open? I'm boiling."Nova boobed her head, "Yeah, it's become really hot, Hagrid.""Can't, Harry, sorry," said Hagrid. Gale followed the half-giant's gaze. Hung in the middle of the fire, below the kettle, was a massive, black egg."Hagrid - what's that?""Ah," said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, "That's er...""That's a Dragon egg, isn't it?" Gale asked"Where did you get it, Hagrid?" said Ron, squatting next to the fire getting a closer look at the egg. "It must've cost you a fortune.""Won it," said Hagrid. "Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.""But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?" said Hermione.Nova nodded, moving to kneel by Ron, "Surely they require more care than even you could provide?" She said."Well, I've bin doin' some readin' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. "Got this outta the library - Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit - it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An' see here - how ter recognize diff'rent eggs - what I got there's a Norwegian Ridgeback. They're rare, them.""Hagrid, you live in a wooden house," Hermione said, pointedly.Gale wiped his brow, then pulled the book closer to him. It was a very old book, with worn pages and faded script. It did detail how to hatch an egg, but it gave no information on raising specific dragon types."Hagrid, you can't rely just on this." Gale said, looking up.But Hagrid had stopped listening as he stoked the fire while humming happily.They were unable to check in with Hagrid, as the homework began to pile up. Gale found himself dozing off over his book often, waking only when Alexa wandered over to poke at him. He had also started to take note of when his kitten took off, wondering where the ball of fluff, who was now looking more and more sleek, was going.Then, about a week later, Harry received a note from Hagrid with only two words: It's hatching.Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to see."How many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?"Gale shook his head, as he adjusted his bookbag, "We really shouldn't skip classes, we need them." He stressed, narrowing his eyes at the red head."We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing -""Shut up!" Harry whispered.Gale glanced over, pausing in alarm when he saw Draco was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen.Ron and Hermione were still arguing when Gale separated to go to Charms. He went through class, wondering if he should pop in on Hagrid during morning break, just to see, but ultimately decided against it. His time was better spent on researching Norwegian Ridgeback's, knowing that Hagrid couldn't keep the dragon long.At lunch, a week later, Harry, Ron and Hermione came down brandishing a letter.Gale had all but forced Nova to start creating a simple study schedule. Meaning many papers were spread across their normal spot. Gale was standing over her, cradling a cup of chocolate milk, while quietly making suggestions. They both started a little when the Gryffindor's slapped the paper down on top of Nova's current project."Your late." Nova snapped, as Gale reached past her to pick up the letter. He quickly took in the words:Dear Ron,How are you? Thanks for the letter - I'd be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.Send me an answer as soon as possible.Love,Charlie"Your brother, I presume?" Gale said, passing the note to the irritated redhead in front of him while glancing at Ron.The other boy nodded, before helping himself to a couple sausages.Hermione peeked at the schedule in front on Nova, then nodded to the honey haired boy, "I'm proud," she paused for a moment, "and surprised that you managed to get her to prepare a schedule."Gale just sent her a shy smile, as Nova huffed."What is the plan?" Nova asked, eyes narrowing at the others. "We can't just walk around the school as we are."Ron shoveled a fork full of eggs into his mouth, "Harry has an Invisibility cloak. We'll be fine."Nova narrowed her eyes, the turned sharply to stare at Harry.Gale however focused on Ron. His hand was swollen, and he was struggling to hold his fork comfortably. Gale moved over and poked the injured hand."Oww, bloody hell Gale!" he snapped, "What are you doing?""I assume that you will be heading to the hospital wing." Gale stated, pulling away.Ron grimaced, "You think Madam Pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite?"Gale blinked, then went pale, "Maybe?" he replied, feeling ill.By the afternoon, though, Ron had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if the dragon's fangs were poisonous.At the end of the day the quartet hurried up to the hospital wing to find Ron in a poor state in bed."It's not just my hand," he whispered, "although that feels like it's about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me - I've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this.""Nah," Nova said, leaning her chair back on two legs, "He's doing it because he's a daddy's boy.""It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday, Ron." said Hermione.At those words, Ron bolted upright, "Midnight on Saturday!" his voice went hoarse. "Oh no oh no - I've just remembered - Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert."Nobody had a chance to answer as Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, telling them Ron needed to sleep."It's too late to change the plan now," Harry told them. "We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that.""Who's going to go with?" Nova asked, "Because I vote that Hermione and Gale stay in."Hermione shot her a look, "Why do you get to choose?"Nova cocked a hip, "Because I haven't been able to do something fun with Harry yet. Last time something exciting happened we were all together."Gale cautiously spoke up, "Only two should go, just to minimize the damage." He offered.Hermione let out a huff, before agreeing.Gale spent the rest of his day attempting to create his own spell, so he could still be present, via Alexa. He wanted to have her keep and eye on his friends, but also see what was happening.When he failed yet again, he found himself lamenting his struggles to Alexa, who was sleeping on the table beside him."Why can't there already be a spell for this? No all we get is Legilimency, which only allows me to see what has happened." He sighed leaning forward heavily. "Why can't life be easy, just once?" He whispered, head falling to his arms.Slowly, he lifted his head, and checked the time, wincing when he saw it was five to eleven. Gale pulled his papers closer, then carefully organised them. Tucking them away, he then got up and prepared for bed, as he had no way of helping his friends.He felt like a failure.He felt like an even bigger failure when he saw the hourglasses the next day. Gryffindor had gone down a hundred points, and Hufflepuff had gone down fifty. Rather quickly he heard other students talking, about how Harry Potter had lost Gryffindor's lead on Slytherin.Sticking close to Harry and Nova, Gale was subject to pointing, and insults, that no one bothered hiding.Quite a few Slytherins, clapped if the group walked by, whistling and cheering, "Thanks Potter, we owe you one!"Gale had noticed that Nova and Harry had thrown themselves into their studies, following the dragon. Though it was a coping technique, that Gale could relate to, he was proud that his friends had taken note of how close exams were. They each kept to themselves, working late into the evening, before separating into their common rooms, only to continue. Each trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions...A week before exams, when Hermione was quizzing Ron on Astronomy, Harry appeared.He appeared slightly concerned, and Nova was quick to ask him what was wrong.Harry began explaining, "I overheard Professor Quirrell and Snape, arguing in an empty classroom." He started, "I decided to listen in, and I think Quirrell gave in."Gale tensed, "What did he say exactly?""I mean not anything specific. He said, "'Not again", and 'all right', he sounded like he was giving in.""Snape's done it, then!" said Ron. "If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell -""There's still Fluffy, though," said Hermione."Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid," said Ron, gesturing to the library. "I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?"There was a light in Ron's eyes, as he talked."We can't do anything." Nova muttered."Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves, we'll be thrown out for sure." Hermione said, confidently."But we've got no proof!" Harry countered. "Quirrell's too scared to back us up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor - who do you think they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think. And don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That'll take a lot of explaining."Gale nodded, "Besides I still wouldn't rule out Professor Quirrell.""He's a jittery mess." Nova commented, dryly.Gale straightened up, "I am to, but I still helped you with the troll!"Harry shook his head, "You're both pretty. Now, please be quiet."Both shot the other looks but stayed silent.Ron leaned away from his work, "If we just do a bit of poking around -""No," said Harry flatly, "we've done enough poking around."Harry then pulled his map of Jupiter towards him then turned to Gale, in order to ask him questions.Oh boy, I have a little bit of news. On my profile i have links to spotify playlists, so you can listen as you read. Or listen when bored, or just listen... I don't know, you do you, man~~~~~ Wolf

Everyone was nervous. It had been a little over a day since Professor Dumbledore had gone down to retrieve Harry, and came up with him unconscious in his arms. None of us had been aloud in the Hospital wing with him, even Nova, who had made a loud fuss, had been forced outside.So here we sat waiting.Professor Dumbledore swept past us, probably to talk to Harry. When he exited only a few minutes later, he smiled at us, but said nothing.The doors opened and Madam Pomfrey ushered us in. Gale settled on a nearby bed, while the others ascertained Harry's condition.The Ron had to ask, "What happened down there?"Harry easily painted a picture. Quirrell had been waiting for him by the mirror, with You-Know-Who, and the mirror which hid the stone. Ron and Hermione were captivated. Gasping and flinching along to his story. Nova however stayed silent, standing off to the side while glaring at Harry."So the Stone's gone?" stated Nova, her arms folding."That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that - what was it? - 'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure."Nova shook her head, letting her hair fall in front of her face."I always said he was off his rocker," said Ron, looking impressed."What happened with all of you?" asked Harry, his eyes darting around."Well, Nova and I got back alright," Hermione started, "We helped Gale get Ron out."Gale stepped forward, "We beelined it to the Owlery, in order to contact Professor Dumbledore, but we met him in the entrance hall."Hermione sent him a grin, "Gale got rather growly when we saw him. He gave Dumbledore a proper order."Harry blinked glancing at Gale, who immediately ducked his head as his face went pink."D'you think he meant you to do it?" inquired Ron. "Sending you your father's cloak and everything?"Hemione exploded, "If he did, he would have been sending Harry in to die!"Harry tilted his head thoughtfully. "He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a fairly good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could...""Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right," said Ron proudly.Nova growled, "He is an idiot. Both you," She pointed to Harry, "and Dumbledore. You are eleven, Harry, and you could have died!" even from a distance Gale could see the tears in her eyes. "You are my best friend Harry, but… you don't have to fight alone!"It was then that Madam Pomfrey hurried over."You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT." she said decisively.Nova glared at Harry, before turning on her heel and storming out. Sedately, Gale, Hermione and Ron followed."What's her problem?" Ron wondered.Gale just shook his head, heading towards the Ravenclaw common room.The next evening, the quartet gathered before the feast. None of them spoke, they just let the silence hang over them comfortably. Then they separated. Each heading to their table, hoping that Harry would get to experience this.The Great Hall was decked out in vibrant silver, and shimmering green, celebrating the Slytherin's house cup, for the seventh year in a row. Towering over the High table was a banner with the Slytherin crest.Gale found himself close to the exuberant, overbearing, personality of Colby, who kept asking rather irritating questions about Harry.The doors to the Great Hall opened and everyone went silent. Gale craned him neck, and spotted Harry ducking his head and darting over to the Gryffindor table. People began to talk loudly and standing up in order to spot him.The Dumbledore arrived, and the room went quiet once again."Another year gone!" Dumbledore said cheerfully. "And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts...""Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two."Loud cheering rang throughout the hall. Glancing over Gale spotted many Slytherins slamming goblets on the table. Draco wasn't. No, that Slytherin was looking across the Ravenclaw table silently. It was odd."Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin," said Dumbledore. "However, recent events must be taken into account."The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles stiffened a little."Ahem," said Dumbledore. "I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes... First - to Mr. Ronald Weasley... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points."The Gryffindor exploded with glee, the cheers nearly shaking the school.Then there was silence."Second - to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points."Gale found himself clapping, despite the angered looks his fellow housemates were giving him. Gryffindor was a hundred points up."Third - to Ms. Nova Lestrange, for outstanding courage and readiness to defend her friends, I award Hufflepuff fifty points."The yellow table cheered, but quieted down quickly."Fourth – to Mr. Gale Lupin…" At his name Gale froze, "for, I award Ravenclaw house fifty points."The surrounding Ravenclaws let out a loud cheer, and Gale found himself silently gaping at Dumbledore. That put them above Slytherin. However, Dumbledore raised his hands, quieting the room."Third - to Mr. Harry Potter..." said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet, "for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points."Everyone went silent. Peering at the points, Gryffindor was tied with Slytherin, with Ravenclaw up four points. Gale raked his mind, was ther eanyone else Dumbledore could give points too?"There are all kinds of courage," continued Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom."The room exploded with cheers as the Gryffindor table stood up. Gale tensed. It was like and explosion had gone off. Gale glanced over to watch as Gryffindors threw themselves at Neville, burying him under a pile. They were overjoyed. Actually, casting a look around, every house, besides Slytherin looked happy. Sure some Ravenclaws looked annoyed that they had come so close then lost, but they were happy that it wasn't Slytherin who had won."Which mean," Dumbledore called over the celebrating houses, "We need a little change of decoration."With a clap of his hands the greens and silvers were gone. Scarlet replaced the green and gold replaced the silver, and the large banner behind the teachers vanished, becoming a large lion.It was overwhelming, but Gale managed to sit through the whole ceremony.Then came the exam results. Comparing it to the others Gale was surprised to learn that he had the best, not counting Hermione who went above and beyond the other first years. His best marks were Charms and, surprisingly, Potions.Then they had to pack away all their Hogwarts lives. Books finding new homes, weighing down their trunks. Gale had a hell of a time convincing Alexa back into her carrier for the journey home, in fact she vanished. Gale wandered around the school calling out hopefully. He explored the towers first, then moved to the lower levels of the school, until he found himself in the dungeons."Alexa, come on now." He called, pleading with his cat. He was tired, sore and only had to get her settled before their last night here."Need a hand?" Gale jumped, turning to stare wide eyed at the blonde behind him."Umm…"Draco rolled his eyes, "You're looking for your cat, yes?"Gale swallowed, "Yeah, she doesn't like her carrier.""How big is it?" Draco asked gesturing for Gale to follow."Umm… about this big," Gale used his hand to indicate it's size."That's it."Gale growled, "I'm not you, Malfoy, I can't afford to buy her a mansion." He glared at the floor, irritated.Draco paused mid step, "That came out wrong.""I don't see how that could come out right."Draco spun around, eyes locking with Gale's, "I know, others don't have as much money as my family, that doesn't make them lesser."Gale raised his head, "But bullying Harry because he didn't want to be friends is okay… or how about treating Neville like dirt because his skill isn't spellwork."A soft meow echoed down the corridor, and Gale glared at Draco, before turning and gathering his cat in his arms. Without a word he walked away. Draco watched, grimacing to himself before heading to his dorm.The ride home was prefaced with little notes, warning them to not use magic at home. From there the first years, soon to be second, were led down to the docks where they got a returning trip to the station in the boats. On the Train they enjoyed each other's company, laughing and eating. Until they had to break in order to pull on Muggle clothing, as they pulled into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles."You must come and stay this summer," said Ron, "all of you - I'll send you an owl.""Thanks," said Harry, "I'll need something to look forward to." Nova elbowed him, with a fake scowl.Gale laughed, "I might not be able to," the group sent him worried looks, "Don't worry, I'll ask, we might get busy though." He offered.Harry, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway first, and Nova and Gale had to wait, before passing through.Nova bounced over to the group, joining their conversation easily. Gale found himself looking around, spotting his dad, reading a Muggle newspaper. Gale approached."I have to head off."Nova turned and pouted, "Alright."Hermione grinned, "We'll send letters. Right." Ron and Harry nodded in unison.Gale gave them a final smile, before heading over to his dad. Remus folded up his paper, and glanced up at Gale, his eye warm."Have a good year?"Gale gave a shy nod, "I met Harry Potter."Remus let out a laugh, as they made their way out of the station.Gale's summer was spent happily sharing many stories with his dad. Remus was scornful when he reprimanded Gale for his recklessness. He couldn't believe that they had gone after wizard with far more experience then them. After that, Gale wandered the old house, doing any chore he could to help his dad. That meant a lot of laundry. Then, if he found time, he read, pouring over books hoping that one would finally contain the secret to curing Lycanthropy. None did.Though Wolfsbane potion was an option, they were not wealthy enough to brew it ever full moon, or any really. So that was cast to the side, though Gale still really wanted to brew it and see its capabilities.Occasionally, Gale received a letter, from Hermione or Ron. Those letters came more frequently as the days went on. They worried about Harry and Nova. Neither had sent any of them a letter, concerned Gale also sent a letter, one to each of them.When no response came, Gale cried. It hurt. He knew they were his friends and he knew that they would write normally. But it was hard to suppress the thought that they had abandoned him. Beneath his hurt, he knew something was wrong, it was just hard.Gale eventually began writing frantically, as the three planned. They had no idea what was wrong, but they had to help. Hermione asked if they knew where Harry and Nova lived, but Gale disheartened had to tell her the two never spoken about it.Ron was the one to come up with a plan. His dad had a flying car, and his brothers, Fred and George, could drive it. They could go and pick the Two up. Hermione shot down that idea. Gale however, agreed, if they were cautious, and avoided Muggles at all cost.That scandalized Hermione, who didn't write back for a while.Gale didn't back down, instead he prepared a letter that Harry and Nova could read when they got to Ron's.The day after his owl was set to arrive at Ron's, his Hogwarts letter arrived, knocking over the cutlery as it settled on the table mid breakfast. Remus let out a small sigh, as he reached out and groomed the owl, carefully taking the letter held in its grasp.Gale awkwardly organized the scattered tableware, as Remus extended the letter."You'll want to read it." He was sent a warm smile, before his dad left the house to let the owl go outside.Enthused, Gale ripped open the letter, and scanned the contents. The letter contained a similar set of direction to last year, informing him to catch the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross station on September first, but Gale focused more on the book list.SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda GoshawkBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy LockhartGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy LockhartHolidays with Hags by Gilderoy LockhartTravels with Trolls by Gilderoy LockhartVoyages with Vampires by Gilderoy LockhartWanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy LockhartYear with the Yeti by Gilderoy LockhartGilderoy Lockhart? Gale looked at his dad, then offered the school list."Who's Gilderoy Lockhart."Remus grimaced, "An extremely overconfident fool, with good charisma. His books are quite popular with the ladies."Gale tilted his head, "They are going to be expensive aren't they." He stated.Remus simply nodded, "I feel sorry for you, whomever is teaching you must be a fan."Gale lifted his arms weakly, letting out a fake cheer.The next day he sent a second letter, to both Hermione and Ron, asking when they'd be in Diagon Alley. Ron was quick to reply with Wednesday.So, Gale prepared to go shopping, ushering Alexa into the house as Remus stood waiting."Remember this will be uncomfortable." Remus warned as they linked arms. Gale nodded, "Deep breaths, don't focus to heavily on what you're feeling." He was advised.Then with a crack they left.It was an odd and extremely uncomfortable feeling. Gale felt as though he was being compressed, and the world went dark. It was hard to breath, and every movement made him feel nauseous.Then the crowded streets of Diagon Alley came into view.Gale found himself stumbling, but was steadied by Remus. Carefully he was lowered onto a nearby bench, as Remus dug through his pockets, eventually pulling out a coin purse."I doubt you want to have me following you about." Remus started, "I will wait in The Leaky Cauldron, come find me when you're done." Remus's gaze was stern as he placed the purse in Gale's hand.Gale nodded, "Thanks, Dad.""No problem, cub." Remus kissed his forehead, then pulled away, heading to the tavern.Left alone, Gale had to catch his breath, before he stood. Then he slowly spun around, only to rammed by a passing person. Gale yelped, and immediately shot to the nearest wall. He stared out at the crowd, hoping to see his friends. Finally, he spotted the familiar fiery red hair of the Weasleys, exiting Gringotts. He bolted over."Ron!" Gale's eye swept over the group, "Harry! Nova!" He cried, hugging them both. Harry let out a small wheeze, and Nova returned the hug. Sheepishly, Gale pulled away.Nova grinned, "Miss us, Freckles?" she teased.Gale just grinned.The quintet, took off along the cobbled street, stopping as Harry bought them all large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they ate happily as they strolled down the alley, examining the many shop windows. They stopped at Quality Quidditch Supplies, so Ron, Harry, and Nova could ogle the brooms.Hermione pulled Gale off to the side."How are you?""Better." Gale admitted, "I may have had a breakdown after you alerted me."Hermione's eyes flashed to his, "But you're fine now." She demanded.He gave a nod, the two wandered off to grab some ink and parchment. When they returned the three were still debating about the broom. The bookworms shared an amused look, then dragged their friends off. They explored many of the shops, but left without buying much.An hour later they headed for Flourish and Blotts. Unfortuanatley, there was a large crowd outside. People were shoving in a desparate attempt to get in the door. The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows:GILDEROY LOCKHARTwill be signing copies of his autobiographyMAGICAL MEtoday 12:30 P.m. to 4:30 P.m."We can actually meet him!" Hermione squealed. "I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist!"The group were jostled as they approached. Gale hated it.A lengthy line wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They all grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and crept up the line to the rest of the Weasleys who were standing with Hermione's parents."Oh, there you are, good," said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded out of breath and kept touching her hair. "We'll be able to see him in a minute …"Before Gilderoy Lockhart could come into view, gale felt his chest seize. He couldn't breath properly. He grabbed Nova, who took one look at him then guided him out of the crowded line over to a small clear area. She knelt next to him and just began to talk. Gale didn't really comprehend what came out of Nova's mouth, instead he focused on his breathing. He hadn't had a panic attack this bad since he was a child, specifically, when he entered his home just after his mom died. He tried to follow Nova's breathing, and slowly the pain in his chest faded."… And then dragons swooped down, did I mention we were cowboys. Do you even know what cowboys are?" Nova continued. "I mean I'm sure we have an equivalent, right, umm… yeah I can't think of one.""Nova, I know what cowboys are." Gale smiled.She let out a small gasp, then leaned over, placing her hand on his forehead. "Are you okay, I was completely winging that. What was that?""That was a panic attack, I think the crowd brought it on… but I can't be sure." said Gale, "I'm okay now, Thanks."Nova smiled, "You're welcome, Freckles. Should we join the others?"Gale shook his head, "I don't want to risk it. You can go though."Nova sniffed, "I'm staying right here. Harry has Hermione…" Then she added, "and Ron."Gale smiled, "What were you saying about cowboys?"Nova blinked, "Uhh…" She tilted her head, "I can't remember… I was just saying whatever came to mind."Gale laughed, causing her to brighten then join in.The crowd they had left, burst into cheers, and looking up gave them the reason. Harry had been dragged up to the front and Gale could now see Lockhart, who looked rather boring. Harry was balancing Lockhart's entire book collection in his arms. He staggered over to Gale and Nova."You can have these." He muttered to Gale. "I'll buy my own -""Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?" Gale found himself ducking his head as Draco Malfoy spoke.Harry straightened up, and Nova jumped to her feet."Oh, please insult him some more, Malfoy. Come on, give me a reason to punch you." Nova said, cracking her knuckles."Potter, you've got yourself a girlfriend!" drawled Malfoy.Both went red as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart's books. "Oh, it's you," said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant he had stepped on. "Bet you're surprised to see Harry here, eh?""Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley," retorted Malfoy. "I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those."Ron went as red dropping his books into the cauldron next to Gale, then started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket."Ron!" said Mr. Weasley, struggling over along with Fred and George. "What are you doing? It's too crowded in here, let's go outside.""Well, well, well - Arthur Weasley." a man who looked like Draco approached. He stopped, placing his hand on Draco's shoulder, sneering at Mr. Weasley."Lucius," said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly."Busy time at the Ministry, I hear," said Mr. Malfoy. "All those raids ... I hope they're paying you overtime?"He reached into the nearby cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy Lockhart books, an old, very battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration."Obviously not," Mr. Malfoy said. "Dear me, what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?"Mr. Weasley flushed darker than Ron."We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy," he said."Clearly," said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to the Grangers, who were watching apprehensively. "The company you keep, Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower -'At that, Mr. Weasley threw himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him back into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came tumbling down on their heads. Gale heard a yell of, "Get him, Dad!" from Fred or George; Mrs. Weasley shrieked out, "No, Arthur, no!"; the crowd hurried backwards, knocking more shelves over; "Gentlemen, please - please!" cried an assistant, and then, louder than it all "Break it up, there, gents, break it up -"Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books and people. With ease he pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was still clutching Ginny's old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes gleaming with malevolence."Here, girl - take your book - it's the best your father can give you -" Pulling himself out of Hagrid's grip he beckoned to Draco, who sent a brief glance at Gale, before they swept from the shop."Yeh should've ignored him, Arthur," said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. "Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that - no Malfoy's worth listenin' ter - bad blood, that's what it is - come on now - let's get outta here."The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with fury."A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in public . . . what Gilderoy Lockhart must've thought -""He was pleased," said Fred. "Didn't you hear him as we were leaving? He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he'd be able to work the fight into his report - said it was all publicity -"They were subdued as they headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron. There Gale pulled his friends over to meet his dad, who was sat calmly in the corner."Dad."Remus glanced up, eyes wandering across the gathered group, "Did you have fun?" He asked.Gale nodded, "We did." I wanted you to mee my friends before they left. Hermione, she the smartest witch in our year. Ron, he's been really nice about the whole stupid thing. Nova, Harry's best friend. And Harry, whom you've definitely heard of." He pointed to each as he spoke.Remus gave them a warm smile, "Remus Lupin, I went to school with your father, Harry."Nova bounced, "Ohh, do you have any fun stories."Remus shook his head, amusement painting his features, "none that would be short enough for you families." He nodded to their parents behind them, "They are getting impatient."Harry gaped at Remus, before hesitantly asking, "Can you write about them, and send that?" his head fell in embarrassment.Remus blinked, "I… I suppose I will."Gale knew his father well, and his dad looked as though he was about to cry.He smiled at his friends, "See you on the train?""Of course." Said Hermione, the others nodded.With a smile the others parted, Harry, Ron and Nova going back to the Weasley's and Hermione, and her parents leaving for the building across the street. Gale was excited, the next year would be fun.

After that, the summer went flying by. Gale spent the rest of his time off, running around preparing his trunk. He had to ask his dad to cast another Feather Light spell on his trunk, because of all the books crammed into it. Come morning, Gale had not slept, instead he had spent his time double checking everything, and dreading the new school year.Remus dropped Gale off at King's Cross Station at ten fifteen. This gave Gale ample time to get on the train and settle into an open compartment. While waiting he pulled out one of his many school notebooks and began scribbling amendments down in the margins."This compartment free?"Gale jumped slightly, his amber eyes lifting to meet the warm brown of Hermione's. He licked his lips, then gave her a small smile. She beamed, and sat down next to him, her eyes bright."What are you working on?"Gale cleared his throat, "I was making notes on Lockhart's books. I don't really trust his material, but that doesn't mean I can slack off."Hermione rolled her eyes, 'I don't see why everyone is so judgemental about him, he did a lot of good things!""Technically, so did Nazi Germany, but that doesn't make them right." He paused, "Or very good."Hermione grimaced, then glanced out at the platform, "The others need to get here soon, or they'll miss the train." she worried.Gale blinked, then followed her gaze, "I'm sure they won't miss the train, they are not that daft." They shared a smile.The two began sharing stories from their respective summers, getting so wrapped up that neither of them noticed the train leaving until they were surrounded by farmland and trees."Where are they?" asked Hermione. Gale found himself shrugging in response. "We better go find them."They peeled themselves from their seats and began looking through the compartments. They started at the front, bumping into the trolley lady and gale found himself buying some chocolate for later. Neither of them were brave enough to actually ask anyone in the compartments if they had seen Harry, Ron or Nova, but the two, instead used their eyes. Each compartment gave them the same answer, they were not on board.They wandered back up to their claimed compartment, and flopped down. Hermione looked terrified, and she kept nervously fidgeting."What if something happened to them?" She worried.Gale reached out and pat her on the shoulder, "They'll be fine, I'm sure if they did get left behind, they were smart enough to send an owl." He gave her a soft smile, "What else would Harry use Hedwig for."Hermione's eyes watered, and she gave a weak chuckle.Despite his assurances, Gale was extremely worried for them. Harry wasn't known for his ability to stay out of trouble, but he could hope. The rest of the journey was filled with anxious silence and concerned looks, as the two approached Hogwarts without their friends.Darkness fell, and the train slowed to a crawl as it reached the station. Hermione clutched anxiously at Gale's hand, and he gratefully returned the favor. Together they got off, following the chaotic mass of older students. That lead them to carriages connected to large skeletal horses, as dark as the sky. The creatures appeared threatening, but Gale knew that they really weren't, he didn't know how he knew that he just knew.It was also then that he realised Hermione hadn't commented on them, and he glanced at her from the corner of his eye. Gale decided that it wasn't the time, and they headed into one of the carriages.Inside was the familiar face of Neville Longbottom and an older Hufflepuff, that Gale didn't know the name of. Neville cast the two a confused glance, but Hermione just shook her head.They were pulled up to the castle, and directed towards the Great Hall, where many stories reached their ears. People were enthusiastically talking about a flying car they had spotted above the train. That gave Gale and Hermione enough to make an educated guess on who was in it.They shared a look, filled with a mix of fear and acceptance. The two sighed in unison, before reluctantly splitting to their own tables.The sorting and feast were very similar to last year, but because of his worry, Gale missed almost everything. He was able to catch Hermione as they left, grabbing her loosely by the arm."Hermione, can you explain everything tomorrow morning?" He asked, quietly.She gave a thin-lipped nod, her eyes filled with anger.It was the next morning, when the studious two learnt about their friend's idiocy."You are completely mental." Gale stated, his face had gotten progressively paler throughout the three's story, and now looked as if he was about to be sick.Nova hopped a little in her seat, "It was really cool, I mean the train's cool and all, but arriving via flying car. I think that makes us the coolest people ever." Gale's jaw dropped, before he shook his head and stood."I'm going to class now.""You haven't received your schedule yet." Said Nova.Gale forced a smile, "No… but I can see Professor Flitwick, who is handing out the Ravenclaw schedules." He stated, then turned and rushed over to the tiny professor. "Professor! Can I have my schedule?"Flitwick gave him a considering look, then nodded, "Good luck this year, Mr. Lupin." He extended the paper to Gale, who sent him a thankful smile.He was just about to leave when shout rang out through the Great Hall, originating from the Gryffindor table."STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHERAND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE –"It was Mrs. Weasley. She obviously agreed with Gale and Hermione and had sent Ron a Howler. It was deafening, and under rapid consideration, Gale left the Hall. Loud shouting echoing from behind him. As soon as the shouting faded, Gale looked at his schedule. First class was double Charms, with Slytherin.Gale set of, navigating the corridors, and changing stairs like he was never gone. He arrived at Charms and settled in his chosen seat. Quietly he pulled out his books, then relaxed in his seat. It wasn't often that he found time to relax before class last year, and he knew that it was likely to be the same this year. At least there wasn't the Philosopher's Stone or Quirrell to worry about.Soon, Professor Flitwick, and the rest of his class arrived. Then he spent the next two hours taking notes on casting a shrinking charm, and how to reverse it. Then he was off to the most dreadful experience ever.Defense Against the Dark Arts with Gilderoy Lockhart.They had barely sat down when Lockhart cleared his throat loudly, even though the room was fairly quiet. He stood and picked up a copy of his book, one that belonged to a flustered Ravenclaw girl."Me," he said, pointing at his image on the cover, winking as well. "Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most Charming-Smile Award - but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!"He paused for people to laugh; a few of the girls giggled."I see you've all bought a complete set of my books -well done. I thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in -" And he went around the room, passing out a substantial stack of paper, before to the front of the class and said, "You have thirty minutes - start - now!"Gale only had to read the first question to figure out how this year was going to go.1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart 's favorite color?2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition?3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?It went on and on, for three pages. If Gale had any rebellious bone in his body, he would have thrown his quill down and refused to do the 'test'. But since he was not a Gryffindor, no matter his parentage, he slouched down and began answering the stupid questions.Thirty minutes later, Lockhart went around to collect the papers, and shuffled through them."Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!"He Smirked widely, giving the class a exaggerated wink. Casting a look around, most of the boys looked as though they had been tortured, while quite a few girls listened with rapt attention. Gale focused on the desk at the front, jumping when Lockhart mentioned him."… but Mr. Gale Lupin knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good job! In fact," he flipped over Gale's paper, "full marks! Where is Mr. Gale Lupin?"Aghast, Gale raised a hand."Excellent!" beamed Lockhart, bouncing almost like Nova, just with less charm. "Quite excellent! Take ten points for Ravenclaw! And so - to business -"He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it."Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizard kind! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm."Most of the class leaned forward, muttering quietly amoung themselves. Even Gale found himself peering curiously at the covered cage."I must ask you not to scream," said Lockhart, lowly. "It might provoke them."The whole class held its breath, filled with anticipation, Lockhart whipped off the cover."Yes," he said dramatically. "Freshly caught Cornish pixies."It was then that almost every girl in class slouched. Gale felt his eyes un-focusing, as Lockhart began warning them about the creatures. Gale knew enough about Cornish pixies without the teacher's nattering. His father often enthused about some of the odder magical creatures, and Gale always listened. Anything Lockhart had to say was bogus compared to Remus.There was a brief moment where, Lockhart looked as though he were about to open the cage, but he stopped. There went learning anything in DA.As Lockhart went on, Gale pulled out a piece of paper, and began to write a pleading letter to his dad.Dad,I find myself in need of your superior knowledge and aid. We have come to realise our teacher in Defence Against the Dark Arts is a bit naff. He almost released Cornish pixies into the classroom with out explaining them to us.I want you to come and teach us. You always made learning fun and engaging… please dad… I'm begging youLove from your favorite child,GaleUnfortunately, after DA he had to go eat lunch and he found himself sitting with the others. Hermione was in the middle of presenting her transfigured buttons."Nice." Said Gale, as he sat down next to her.Ron crossed his arms, "Would you stop, we get it, you are smart.""What've we got this afternoon?" said Harry, hastily changing the subject."Defense Against the Dark Arts," said Hermione at once."Why," demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, "have you outlined all Lockhart's lessons in little hearts?"Nova practically jumped across the table in order to peer at the paper in his hands. Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiouslyThey finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone step, along with Gale and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampire, Gale simply pulled out his letter to proofread. Just a little way away Nova, Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch.Gale buried himself into his words, ignoring the world around him. Until an extremely familiar voice rang out across the courtyard."Signed photos? You're giving out signed photos, Potter?"The two on the step looked up. Draco Malfoy was stood just behind a small mousy-haired boy with a large camera. Flanking him were his large and brutish companions, Crabbe and Goyle."Everyone line up!" Malfoy roared to nearby students. "Harry Potter's giving out signed photos!""No, I'm not," Harry snapped, his fists clenched into fists. "Shut up, Malfoy.""You're just jealous," piped up the small camera boy."Jealous?" said Malfoy, speaking normally, as he had caught the attention of the whole courtyard. "Of what? I don't want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. I don't think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself."Gale sighed and stood, why couldn't Draco ever just be nice?"Eat slugs, Malfoy," snapped Ron angrily.Both Crabbe and Goyle, Gale was really curious what their first names were, stopped laughing, stepping forward in an attempt to intimidate them."Be careful, Weasley," sneered Malfoy. "You don't want to start any trouble or your Mommy'll have to come and take you away from school." He put on a shrill, piercing voice. "If you put another toe out of line' - "A small group of Slytherin fifth years laughed loudly. "Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter," smirked Malfoy. "It'd be worth more than his family's whole house -"Ron whipped out his wand, which had been shoddily repaired after their arrival, but Hermione snapped Voyages with Vampires shut and whispered, "Look out!""What's all this, what's all this?" Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. "Who's giving out signed photos?"Harry just opened his mouth, but was cut off when Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and rumbled cheerily, "Shouldn't have asked! We meet again, Harry!""Come on then, Mr. Creevey," said Lockhart, beaming at the camera boy. "A double portrait, can't do better than that, and we'll both sign it for you."He fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes."Off you go, move along there," Lockhart called to the crowd, then turned and led Harry away."He is vile." Said Nova.Gale gathered his things and began back to class, "Who, Draco, or Lockhart?"Nova struggled for a moment, "I… I… Both… Yeah both."Gale smiled, but Hermione jumped in."Professor Lockhart isn't bad; he's done a lot for the wizarding world." She defended."I'll give you two months." Gale said, before ducking away from the group to head to Potions.At dinner, Gale was prepared to send his letter to his father."He actually let them out?" Gale's voice went shrill with disbelief.Harry nodded vigorously, "And he made us deal with it.""What spell did he try?""Peskipiksi Pesternomi."Gale let his head fall against the table, "He made that up." He looked up at Hermione, "Surely you know that right. The best spell to use against Cornish pixies is either a stunning spell, which only works on one, or Immobulus, which can slow a large group."Hermione sniffed, "And how do you know that, are you the teacher?""No, but my dad always wanted to be.""Then why isn't he?" inquired Nova.Gale bit his lip, "Conflict of interest.""Because you'd be his student?" Harry asked.Gale shook his head, "Ministry issues."Ron nodded vigorously, "They can be bloody vindicative."Two days passed, and then there was a conflict. Of course, Gale had to learn it from Hermione during the other's detention, but it made little difference. He was angry. Gale paced, feet hitting the ground loudly as he went back and forth."I can't believe he called you that." Gale growled, "I thought he could be a friend, but no he had to go insult my best friend." He slammed a book hard on the library table."Gale, calm down." Hermione tried, "I didn't even know what it meant."Gale stared at her, "But he did. And he still used it." He snapped, swallowing when she flinched. "I'm sorry.""it's fine.""It's really not." Gale's voice softened, as he sat down beside her, "Here I am getting upset, and snapping at you, that I haven't asked you the most important question."Gale reached out and grabbed Hermione's hands in his, Amber eyes glittering with apology."How are you?"With that Hermione burst into tears. Gale closed his eyes and pulled her closer, wrapping himself around her. Her tears soaked Gale's robes, as he ran a hand through her bushy hair. They sat their curled up together for quite a while before she pulled away."It hurts. I thought I had found my place… I don't think I have.""Hermione," Gale leaned forward, and wiped some tears from her cheeks. "You have found a place. Everyone has bullies, even people like Draco Malfoy."Hermione nodded, then gave him a weak smile, "Thanks." She whispered.He grinned at her, "Welcome. Now, can we plan some fictional revenge as therapy?"She let out a watery laugh before nodding. Gale pulled her closer, and began writing out on one of their abandoned pieces of parchment, scrawling out every detail for his revenge."A death day party?"Gale stared at the others. Harry was sitting beside a very jittery Nova, while Ron grinned. Hermione gave him a soft smile, then nodded. This was definitely a bizarre way to start a Sunday."I know." Ron said sagely, "I had the same reaction.""I don't mean to be rude; I just don't think that would be very hospitable for living guests." He responded slowly. "And that would mean missing the Halloween feast."Nova stilled, "Harry, we can still go to the feast… right?"In response, Harry flushed, "I mean, we could just stop in before the feast… or after."Gale considered for a moment, "I would say after, just in case they don't have food."However come Halloween, none of them were terribly enthusiastic about the party. But at seven o'clock, they walked straight past the warmly lit Great Hall, and its rich pumpkin smells, and going down toward the dungeons. The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had was lined with candles that fit the season well. They were long, thin, and jet-black, all burning bright blue, casting a ghostly light over their faces. The temperature dropped with each step they took. As they drew closer the grating sound of thousands of fingernails scraping a massive blackboard."Is that supposed to be music?" Ron whispered.They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes."My dear friends," he said mournfully. "Welcome, welcome . . . so pleased you could come. . ."He swept off his crested hat and bowed them in. It was an extraordinary sight. The dungeon was filled of hundreds of ghosts, who drifted around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the appalling, shaky sound of musical saws, played by an orchestra on a black-draped platform. The chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a many more black candles. Their breath formed a mist as they exhaled; it was like stepping into a freezer."Shall we have a look around?" Harry suggested, shifting uncomfortably."Careful not to walk through anyone," said Ron nervously, and they set off around the dance floor."Well this is cheery." Nova commented, as the passed a group of melancholy nuns, a ragged man in chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Even the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was here, though other ghosts gave him a wide berth."Oh, no," Hermione, stopped abruptly. "Turn back, turn back, I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle -""Who?" asked Harry."She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor," said Hermione."She haunts a toilet?""Oh, you mean the out of order one?" Nova asked."Yes. It's been out-of-order all last year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you -""Look, food!" said Ron."I wouldn't trust it." Gale advised, as they headed towards a long table, covered in black velvet.Ron approached it eagerly but stopped in his tracks, horrified. The smell was quite repulsive. Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington, died 31st October, 1492.Gale went pale, just as a portly ghost walked through the table, his mouth held wide open."Can you taste it if you walk though it?" Harry asked him."Almost," replied the ghost sadly, then drifted away."I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor," said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis."Can we move? I feel sick," Ron muttered.They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them."Hello, Peeves," Harry cautiously, greeted.Unlike the other ghosts, Peeves the Poltergeist was the opposite of pale and transparent. He had donned a bright orange party hat, a spinning bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face."Nibbles?" he asked, offering a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus."No thanks," said Hermione."Heard you talking about poor Myrtle," said Peeves, his eyes glittering. "Rude you was about poor Myrtle." He took in a deep breath then hollered, "OY! MYRTLE!""Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset," Hermione frantically whispered. "I didn't mean it, I don't mind her - er, hello, Myrtle."A pale ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly glasses."What?" she said sulkily."How are you, Myrtle?" said Hermione in a false, bright voice. "It's nice to see you out of the toilet." Myrtle sniffed."Miss Granger was just talking about you -" said Peeves slyly in Myrtle's ear."Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight," said Hermione, glaring at Peeves. Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously. "You're making fun of me," she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes."No - honestly - didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?" said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs."Oh, yeah -""She did -""Don't lie to me," Myrtle gasped, tears suddenly flooding down her face, all while Peeves chuckled happily. "D'you think I don't know what people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!""You've forgotten pimply," Peeves leaned forward and hissed.Moaning Myrtle burst into grief-stricken sobs and fled. Peeves followed, attacking her with moldy peanuts, yelling, "Pimply! Pimply!""Oh, dear," said Hermione sadly.Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd."Enjoying yourselves?""Oh, yes," was the collective lie."Not a bad turnout," said Nearly Headless Nick, proudly. "The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent… It's nearly time for my speech, I'd better go and warn the orchestra…"The orchestra abruptly stopped at that very moment. They, and everyone in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded."Oh, here we go," said Nearly Headless Nick. bitterly.Through a dungeon wall burst forth a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The crowd clapped wildly. The horses trotted to the middle of the floor and halted, rearing. At the front of the pack was a large ghost, his bearded head tucked under his arm, as he blew the horn.The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd, causing laughter, and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, cramming his head back onto his neck."Nick!" he cried. "How are you? Head still hanging in there?" He gave a hearty chortle, clapping Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder."Welcome, Patrick," Nick said, stiffly."Live 'uns!" said Sir Patrick, spotting the quintet and giving a huge, faux jump of surprise, causing his head fell off again; nearby ghosts howled with laughter."Very amusing," said Nearly Headless Nick darkly."Don't mind Nick!" shouted Sir Patrick's head from is place on the floor. "Still upset we won't let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow -""I think," said Harry hurriedly, "Nick's very - frightening and - er -""Ha!" shouted Sir Patrick's head. "Bet he asked you to say that!""If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!" Nearly Headless Nick said loudly, striding toward the podium and entering an icy blue spotlight. "My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow . . ." But everybody's attention was somewhere elseThat somewhere else was Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt, as they started a game of Head Hockey. Nearly Headless Nick tried hopelessly to recollect his audience, but gave up when Sir Patrick's head went sailing past him to loud cheers."I can't stand much more of this," Ron muttered, his teeth chattering.The orchestra jumped back into action, meaning the ghosts swept back across the dance floor."Let's go," Harry agreed.They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles."Pudding might not be finished yet," said Ron hopefully, leading them back to the entrance hall."Mm, pudding." hummed Nova, eyes closing as she imagined it before her.Gale grimaced, "Maybe we could all just grab something from the kitchens, so we don't cause a disturbance." Hermione nodded, lightly, in agreement."It's the Great Hall, we won't cause any problems going there." Ron stated.Gale glanced back the way they came; he was certain that they really could. Especially if last year had taught him anything.

They had just reached the top of the staircase when Harry staggered into the wall."Harry!" Nova yelped, immediately circling to support him."Harry, what're you -?""It's that voice again - shut up a minute -"Gale's confusion was palpable, but he didn't ask, instead moving closer."Listen!" said Harry urgently, and everyone froze.The halls were silent. In fact, Gale glanced up and down the corridors, seeing no one. Everyone else was at the feast. Harry's gaze moved to the ceiling. Gale sent the others a worried look, but no one saw, they were too focused on Harry."This way," he suddenly shouted. Harry bolted up the stairs, into the entrance hall. Gale cautiously followed, keeping to the back, as Nova, Hermione and Ron clattered after. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor."Harry, what're we –""SHH!"Gale pulled back, making a small hum. Hoping to hear whatever Harry was, he closed his eyes and focused. Standing still, he strained his ears, but nothing sounded different. Gale opened his eyes, only to see the group gone.He nodded to himself, and took a step back towards the Great Hall. Gale was rather hungry, and they couldn't really blame him, could they. He stood there, indecisively looking back and forth, then decided that food sounded better right now.Backtracking, Gale slid into the Great Hall, where many students were settled into their own conversations, mid-dessert. He found a seat near the end of the Ravenclaw table then grabbed a few small items to eat. And he ate them quickly as he was uncertain how much longer the food would be there.Gale kept an eye on the nearby Ravenclaws, hoping that nobody had noticed his late arrival. None appeared to be aware of any changes.Because of his late arrival, the food vanished mid brownie. Gale hesitantly followed as loud movement began in the hall. He tried to stick close to the front, if only so he could spot his friends. They went over too the second floor, thousands of loud voices filled the corridor, along with thunderous footsteps.Gale's eyes locked on the strange sight. Nova, Harry, Hermione, and Ron were all stood near dark red words. "The chamber of secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware." Just below the words were a familiar cat. Mrs. Norris was hanging from the torch by her tail.Everybody else went quiet as they spotted the sight before them. Someone was shoved into Gale, who stumbled into the wall.Moving past was Draco, who bit out, "Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!"That shout attracted more interest."What's going on here? What's going on?" Argus Filch shouldered his way through the crowd, stopping when his eyes fell on his cat. "You! You! You've murdered my cat! You've killed her! I'll kill you! I'll -" He took a few steps towards Harry."Argus!" came the low demand of Dumbledore's voice.Just behind him were a number of other teachers. Dumbledore swept past the gathered students and detached the suspended cat."Come with me, Argus," he said to Filch. "You, too, Mr. Potter, Miss Lestrange, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger."Lockhart stepped forward, "My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free -""Thank you, Gilderoy," said Dumbledore.The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and Professor Snape.Gale turned to watch his friends, but made no move to follow. As they disappeared down the hall, theories were thrown around energetically.Glancing back, Gale's eyes met Draco's. The blonde's head ducked down, cheeks turning pink, but gale paid him no mind. Instead, he bolted back to his common room, hoping to find some information on the Chamber of Secrets.Gale breezed past the knocker's riddle, then ran up the stairs to his room. He flew throughout the room, digging around his luggage. With great glee, he lifted his copy of Hogwarts, A History, by Bathilda Bagshot above his head. He lightly set it on his bed, then sat down. He pulled the book to him, then began to skim over the contents, searching for the Chamber of Secrets.He pulled his blankets around him, becoming absorbed into history. Occasionally, Gale would take a few notes, or reach out to pet Alexa, who was stretched out in the middle of his bed.Gale sat reading throughout the night, wand tip glowing, just to provide light. His mind focused entirely on his research."Merow!"Gale jumped his eyes jerking around the room, until his gaze landed on the irritated black cat sitting before him. He grimaced, at her then cast a look to the nearby window. Faint morning light streaked through the glass, dust floated through the air, now visible with the early sunlight.Gale carefully moved his book to the side, and slide out of the blankets. He was still dressed, but he wanted to at least try to make himself presentable.Bolting down the tower, with his notes and book in hand, Gale slid into the group's typical meeting spot at the Gryffindor table. He flipped the book open on the table, then grabbed a few croissants, and his morning chocolate milk.Despite his excitement, he wasn't sure about presenting any of his gathered knowledge to his friends. So, when Nova muttered a greeting then flopped into her seat, he stayed silent.Just because Gale kept quiet didn't mean the rest of the school was willing to. Filch had taken the attack on his cat very seriously, and paced where she had been left, he even went at the writing on the wall with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, which did absolutely nothing.In the following days, Gale and Hermione had sheltered away within the Library, doing as much research as possible on the Chamber of Secrets and, after it was explained that Mrs. Norris was petrified, anything that could cause petrification.Unfortunately, even with Gale's, copy of Hogwarts, A History, they could find little about the Chamber. All that had been written was that it was rumored to have been created by Salazar Slytherin, then sealed away. There was little else to go on.Hermione let out a frustrated groan, throwing herself across the book in front of her."Same." Gale muttered, slamming a copy of Fantastic Beasts and where to Find Them shut."Why can't we find anything on this chamber?" She rubbed her face, "It must exist, because why else would it be mentioned at the attack?"Gale curled up around Alexa, who was purring in his lap. He absently began scratching her back, and tried to think, but his mind felt like mush."We need to take a break." He sighed, feeling defeated.Hermione stacked their collective books, and stood."We can't give up Gale, this is important.""I know it is 'mione, but I'm wreaked." Gale lifted his cat up to his shoulder, where she settled. "We've found nothing of value, and if we wanted to narrow down what creature, or thing, that petrified Mrs. Norris, we need more information." He leaned forward, eyes pleading with her.She let out a soft growl, before her body seemed to sag, "Yeah, okay."Gale nodded, then grabbed half of the book pile, He efficiently put the book back on their respective shelves, then moved to the door. Hermione was right on his heels.Together they left, both having to inform the others that they had no helpful knowledge.A day passed, with little change, until they gathered at the Gryffindor table that evening."We have information!" Hermione practically shouted at Gale, as the three red wearing students slid into their seats."What?" Nova asked blearily. She had fallen asleep at the table.Harry leaned forward, "Hermione interrupted Professor Binns and asked him about the Chamber of Secrets.""Really?" Gale perked up, gaze turning to regard Hermione, "What'd he say?"Hermione took a breath, "The founders began to argue about who were being admitted into Hogwarts, Salazar Slytherin wanted it to be kept within magic users, and their families. Of course, he was outvoted. He hated the Muggle-born students, which caused an argument between Slytherin and Gryffindor, ending with Slytherin leaving." She took in another breath, "According to legend, Salazar Slytherin hid a sealed chamber inside the castle, which only his heir can open. He didn't know what was in the Chamber. He just called it a horror that would purge the school of those unworthy to study magic.""No wonder there isn't much information on the chamber." Gale murmured, settling back."How would you seal of a chamber like that, Gale?""Blood Wards." Was his immediate response."Blood Wards?" Harry asked."Wards directly linked to a family bloodline. Most of the time they are used as a protection of sorts, but you can make a version that only activates or does something when that bloodline is in contact, or does something."Nova's nose wrinkled in befuddlement, "Then why weren't they used during the first war?""Because they often require the individual casting it to give up a piece of them. Like their magical essence. So, it's kinda not that efficient."Hermione hummed, in acknowledgement. They all fell into a comfortable silence, as they ate. They were miway through desert when nova spoke."We should go investigate the hall." She stated it as a fact.Hermione cast a nervous glance towards the teachers, "I don't know, that seems a bit risky.""Can't hurt to have a poke around." Harry said, not looking up from his food. Gale gave a hesitant nod, they did need more information on what was happening.The group easily slipped out into the corridor, and scrambled to the scene of the attack. Turning the corner, it was very apparent nothing had changed, sure Mrs. Norris was gone, but the area still had that eerie feeling which lingered.They split up, each carefully running over the area. Harry lowered himself to his knees, Nova examined the nearby walls, Hermione and Ron went to the window. Gale stepped closer to the script on the wall.Gale reached out and ran a hand across the dark red letters, then pulled his hand back to look. The letters remained unchanged, and his hand was clean.Gale's eyes flickered across the writing, it had been written fairly low to the ground, and upon silent contemplation, Gale had to rule out anyone who was older than them, as many of the older students would have written it far higher.He hated having to consider that it was a first-year student who had written the message."Come and look at this!" said Hermione. "This is funny…"The five gathered around Hermione, moving to the window next to the red words. Hermione pointed at the top pane, where a line of spiders were fighting to get out through a small crack in the glass."Have you ever seen spiders act like that?" Hermione inquired.Gale leaned closer, "No, this is very new.""No," Harry echoed, then looked behind him, "have you, Ron? Ron?"Noca let out a soft snicker, and Gale followed her eyeline to a very pale Ron. His body was tense, fight or flight response starting to kick into gear."What's up?" said Harry."I - don't - like - spiders," said Ron tensely."I never knew that" said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise. "You've used spiders in Potions loads of times…""I don't mind them dead," said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window. "I just don't like the way they move…"Hermione giggled, which caused Nova to let out a loud laugh."It's not funny," said Ron, fiercely. "If you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big fiIthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick ... You wouldn't like them either if you'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and…" He shuddered.The girls exchanged gleeful looks, before they both broke out into laughter. It echoed in the hall, and Gale found himself smiling along, despite feeling sympathy for Ron. It was pretty amusing."Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from? Someone's mopped it up." Harry spoke, attempting to corral the group's amusement."It was about here," said Ron, happily moving away from the spiders, "Level with this door."His hand extended for the brass knob, but drew away before touching it."What's the matter?" asked Harry."Can't go in there," said Ron. "That's a girls' toilet.""Oh, Ron, there won't be anyone in there," said Hermione, as she moved over to him. "That's Moaning Myrtle's place. Come on, let's have a look."She reached out and opened the door, ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign. Nova was quick to follow, with Harry matching her pace, leaving Gale and Ron outside.Gale awkwardly gestured, "After you."Ron sent him a glum look, but went in without a word.Gale slid int after them. It was a very unwelcoming bathroom. The mirrors that hang above the sinks were cracked and spotted, and the sinks themselves were chipped, weathered from a lack of care. The floor appeared green from mildew, but it wasn't slick, so no one was going to be slipping across the floor. The stalls were tilted slightly, and paint was flaking off of the surface, leaving the wood beneath exposed.Hermione put a finger to her lips, then set off to the end stall. She carefully opened the door, and said, "Hello, Myrtle, how are you?"Nova scampered up behind, with the boys following close behind. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the toilet tank, eyeing the boys with suspicion."This is a girls' bathroom. They're not girls.""No," Hermione nodded. "I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is in here." She waved behind her, towards the chipped sinks.Harry mouthed something to Hermione, and Gale shifted forwards, catching the tail end, '…she saw anything'"What are you whispering?" said Myrtle, Eyes locking onto Harry."Nothing," Harry quickly replied. "We wanted to ask -""I wish people would stop talking behind my back!" said Myrtle, barely holding in a sob. "I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead -""Myrtle, no one wants to upset you. Harry only -" Hermione tried."No one wants to upset me! That's a good one!" howled Myrtle. "My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!""Myrtle, we just wanted to know if you saw anything strange after leaving the party Halloween night." Nova pushed, "a cat was attacked just outside you're door, and we though you might know something.""Did you see anyone near here that night?" asked Harry."I wasn't paying attention," said Myrtle, dramatically. "Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then, of course, I remembered that I'm - that I'm ""Already dead," offered Ron, skilllessly.Myrtle let out a grievous sob as she rose up, in one motion she flipped, diving headfirst into the toilet sending water to the floor with a splash, as she disappeared from view.Gale tilted his head to Hermione, silently asking if this was at all worth the time."Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle… Come on, let's go."Hermione led them out, Harry was the last one out. He had just closed the door when a loud voice made them all jump."RON!"Just down the hall was a familiar read-head, Percy Weasley. He had frozen at the top of the stairs, expression completely shocked."That's a girls' bathroom!" he gasped. "What were you -?""Just having a look around," Ron shrugged, nonchalantly. "Clues, you know -"The prefect's chest puffed up, and a stern look spread across his face."Get - away - from - there -" Perry said, striding toward them to usher them away, his arms flapping. "Don't you care what this looks like? Coming back here while everyone's at dinner -""Why shouldn't we be here?" demanded Ron, fiercely, stopping short to glare at Percy. "Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!""That's what I told Ginny," said Percy fiercely, "but she still seems to think you're going to be expelled, I've never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business -""You don't care about Ginny," Ron snapped, his ears were growing very red. "You're just worried I'm going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy -""Five points from Gryffindor!" Percy said tersely, fingers running over his prefect badge. "And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or I'll write to Mum!"The he was practically stomping down the hall, features just as red as Ron's ears.They all exchanged looks, then with great trepidation split up."Let me know if I got this right. You want to brew some Polyjuice Potion in order to interview Draco Malfoy, because you believe him to be the heir of Slytherin." Gale's head dropped when the three nodded."I'm in." Nova piped up."I'm not." Gale snapped, "This is unlikely to be anyone who went to school last year, as it's happening this year.""Oh, come on, you can't know that for certain." Ron scoffed.Nova looked between Ron and Gale,"What's your reasoning?" She asked, eyes glittering.Gale bit his lip, then responded, "If it was someone from our year, why did they wait until now. Why not do this last year? And why did they write their message so low? I mean I'm barely four foot three, but if I wrote that message I would have to crouch uncomfortably.""Short people exist." Nova pointed out."Nova… you can't talk, you're taller than me."Harry chuckled, "She does raise a point though.""But" Gale raised a finger, "Draco is taller than me, by a fair margin.""That doesn't rule him out though." Hermione said."Well, no, but come on, he's a prat, but he wouldn't hurt anyone like that.""You have a lot of confidence in him." Harry commented.Gale shook his head, "Because I give everyone the benefit of the doubt… Draco is not his father."Nova vigorously nodded, "Just like I am not my mother."He sent the others a pointed look, "I will not be helping you faff about trying to incriminate Draco."Then he stood from his spot and left the hall, hoping that his departure made them all think a bit before they inevitably ran off to do exactly as they previously stated.Gale loathed to admit that he relied heavily on his connection to the three Gryffindors and one Hufflepuff. He spent a week being ignored by Nova and Ron, and even though she wasn't ignoring him, Hermione hadn't talked to him as much the weeks following their plan. Harry was the only one acting relatively normal, but even the boy-who-lived had no explanation for their friends' oddities.Harry slid into the seat across from Gale, rubbing his eyes wearily."You okay?" Gale rasped; voice heavy with exhaustion.Harry yawned, "Oliver has been wearing us down this year." A tired smile tugged at his lips, "I love Quidditch, but Oliver takes it to a new level.""Ha! All you sporty people are weird to us nerds." Gale pretended to adjust his non-existent glasses. Harry let out a soft chuckle."Is Nova still not talking to you?""Nope." Gale pursed his lips, "I don't know why she isn't though, I just gave you lot my opinion."Harry nodded, "and me and Hermione understand that. I guess Ron and Nova don't see it that way."Gale shrugged, cluelessly."I have no idea, I thought she agreed with my reasoning when I brought it up.""It's Nova." Harry stated, "She isn't very linear.""Pulling out the big words there, Potter." Gale teased, Slipping his homework away.Harry laughed, but he turned his attention to the unfinished essay in front of him."Are you coming to the game this Saturday?" He inquired, quill still above his parchment.Gale slumped, "I guess I will. It's you guys versus Slytherin, right?"Harry grinned, "Yeah.""Then I'll be there."Gale walked with Harry down to the pitch come that Saturday. He wished his friend luck, before navigating the chaos of the stands. Eventually, Gale found a spot without his other friends, eyes focused intently on the ground below.Considering last years game, he had a right to be nervous for Harry, Gale did not want him dead.The crowded stands grew loud as the teams walked out onto the pitch. Even from a distance the tension between the two Captain's was felt, both trying to intimidate the other.The whistle rang out, and the green and red players rose into the air. Gale focused on Harry, as he flew higher above the others. Only a few seconds later a Bludger went flying toward him.Gale's eyes snapped to where the ball had come from, but neither of the two Slytherin beaters were anywhere near there. Gale rose, his gaze settling back on Harry.Harry went streaking across the pitch, the Bludger mirroring his movements.What was going on? Gale was not fantastic with Quidditch rules, but he was certain that Bludgers were not supposed to concentrate on a single player.The Gryffindor beaters, the Weasley twins, kept close to Harry, trying desperately to keep the ball from hurting him. This went on for quite a few minutes, and the longer it went on the more anxious Gale got.The Gryffindor team called for a time out, but to Gale's astonishment, the game resumed, and Harry was left on his own with the stray Bludger.In attempts to avoid the ball, Harry went twirling through the air, leaving Gale to perch nervously on the edge of his seat. There was a brief moment where Harry paused, allowing the Bludger to slam into him. Harry's arm went slack before he aimed towards Draco.Harry reached out to grab something, before careening into the muddy earth below.Gale sprang from his spot and raced down the stand, dodging the chaotic student body. He bolted across the wet field and slid over to Harry.The raven-haired boy's arm was completely knackered, arm bent at just the wrong angle. Gale lowered next to him and began trying to make a basic splint for his friend. Gale barely noticed the sudden appearance of Gilderoy Lockhart, who pushed him aside.Harry let out a low moan, "Oh, no, not you.""Doesn't know what he's saying," said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd gathering around them. "Not to worry, Harry. I'm about to fix your arm.""No!" said Harry. "I'll keep it like this, thanks…"Gale pushed at the 'Professor', "Harry should be immediately taken to the hospital wing." He pressed."He should really, Professor," agreed a very muddy Oliver Wood, who was grinning despite Harry's injury. "Great capture, Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, Id say -""Stand back," Lockhart commanded, as he rolled up his jade-green sleeves."No." Gale groaned as Lockhart waved his wand over Harry's arm.It was an unpleasant sight. Harry's arm flashed a pale green, then seemed to turn into a jelly. It dropped under its own weight, moving unpleasantly with Lockhart's ministrations. If Gale had to guess, he would say that the arm had no bones."Ah," said Lockhart. "Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the point is, the bones are no longer broken. That's the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Lupin, would you escort him? - and Madam Pomfrey will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit."Gale helped Harry up, glaring angrily at the fraud of a teacher they had been saddled with for Defense.Madame Pomfrey seemed to agree, both with Gale's assessment of the 'injury', and of Lockhart."You should have come straight to me!" she raged, examining what remained of Harry's arm. "I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back - ""You will be able to, won't you?" asked Harry, desperately."I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful," said Madam Pomfrey grimly, tossing Harry a pair of pajamas. "You'll have to stay the night…"Gale carefully helped Harry into his pajamas, stuffing the rubbery arm into a sleeve. Past the drawn curtain, they could hear Nova lambasting Lockhart, and Hermione's crush on him. Hermione had little defense, besides "it was a mistake'."It doesn't hurt anymore, does it, Harry?""No," Harry responded, getting into a bed. "But it doesn't do anything else either."Gale vanished around the curtain, to cautiously talk to Madam Pomfrey."How do you regrow bones?" He asked, quietly."Skele-Gro." She responded, grabbing a bottle with the same label, "It is a very painful process, and rather unpleasant. You should have taken him straight to me."Gale ducked his head, following her, "I tried, but Professor Lockhart didn't listen."Madam Pomfrey scoffed, then bustled around Harry. She carefully gave him some Skele-Gro, then whisked away, back to her office."We won, though," said Ron, a grin breaking across his face. "That was some catch you made. Malfoy's face ... he looked ready to kill…""I want to know how he fixed that Bludger," said Hermione, darkly."We can add that to the list of questions we'll ask him when we've taken the Polyjuice Potion," said Nova, as she settled into a chair next to Harry."I hope it tastes better than this stuff …" Harry muttered."If it's got bits of Slytherins in it? You've got to be joking," said Ron.Gale rolled his eyes, just as the hospital wing doors burst open. the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry still covered in wet mud."Unbelievable flying, Harry," said George. "I've just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn't seem too happy."The team were ladened with a variety of cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry's bed and were just about to start an impromptu party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over."This boy needs rest; he's got thirty-three bones to regrow! Out! OUT!" She ushered everyone out.Nova grinned to the others, "Party in Gryffindor tower?" She asked brightly.One of the Weasley twins smirked, "We're game, right."Gale shook his head, as the team agreed. He split off heading straight up to his room, where he flopped into the mattress. Alexa curled up against him, and Gale found himself dozing off to her loudly purring in his ear.Hello! Sorry for not uploading last Sunday, but it was Thanksgiving, and I have been preparing for the 13 days of Halloween, where I make 13 vaguely Halloween art pieces. There will be a piece for both Gale and Nova, so if you want to see those, head over to my Deviantart.I thank you all for the follows, but honestly Please review, this is a hobby, but I still want to learn more and I can't do that if I don't get any input.~~~~~ Wolf

Gale spent a good amount of the following days, sequestered inside the library. Book sat in piles, forming large walls around him as he navigated the pages, hoping for some sort of information on the possible culprit behind petrifying Mrs. Norris, and recently, Colin Creevey.He knew the others had locked onto Draco, even though there was little evidence against him. Gale understood that Draco wasn't always that nice, but he was not a Death Eater like his father, who claimed he wasn't.Placing his fiftieth book off to the side, Gale lifted his arms up, allowing his back top pop slightly. He was stiff, and tired. Slowly he replaced his many books upon their shelves before leaving the Library.The halls were quiet, with only a few students milling about. Gale gave those he passed a small smile, but stayed as isolated as he could. When he finally passed the entrance hall, He noticed a group near the notice board.Curious, he moved up to see what had captured their interest.There was new piece of parchment inviting students from all houses to join the new dueling club. Below that was the time, scheduled for that evening at eight o'clock.Sending a cursory look over the words, Gale nodded. He was not a proficient dueler; his talents lay more in Potions and Charms, so he was definitely going to at least the first meeting, if not all of them.Gale slipped into the Hall and sat down beside Hermione. She was alone at the table, with what appeared to be an essay spread out before her. Humming to himself, Gale pulled out his own essay and extended it out to her."Shall we proofread?"Hermione sent him a relieved grin, and took his parchment. The two sat their in comfortable silence, only occasionally breaking it to ask the other questions.They hastily tucked away their work when the others joined them for dinner.Gale left the group, heading up to the Ravenclaw tower to check up on Alexa, Then, he hurried back down to wait outside the Great Hall.He pulled out his journal on Lycanthropy and it's known aids, just to do something while he waited.When a large group of students passed him, Gale took that as a sign that it was time, so he slid his book away and stood. Dusting himself off, he took a few calming breaths, it was only the first day, so it couldn't go that bad.Entering the Hall felt like a new experience. The long house tables were no where to be seen, and a large golden stage had been set up along one wall. The large space felt cramped, as many students had come to see what the dueling club was all about.Gale glanced around, spotting Nova with the others. He beelined straight to them."Do you know who's going to be running this?" He asked, conversationally.Nova huffed, then turned to look at him."No." Was her curt response.With a deep sigh, Gale tugged her closer. He leaned in and muttered quietly to her."What did I do?"Nova bit her lip, "I'm being an idiot.""What?" Gale was confused, "How does that explain why you are acting so oddly?""Your too nice, Gale." She snapped, "I don't understand why you are so willing to defend Malfoy when he has done nothing but bully us."With a shake of his head, Gale responded, "He is just following what his father would do… like me.""Your dad would run from adventure?""Yeah, if he could." Gale glanced back to the others, "Are we fine?""Yeah."The two moved back to Harry, Ron and Hermione."Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young - maybe it'll be him." said Hermione, conversationally."As long as it's not -" Harry started, then cut himself off with a moan of despair.Everyone followed his eyeline to a confident Gilderoy Lockhart, donned in deep plum robes, with Snape accompanying him.Lockhart waved an arm, catching the chatting students' attention."Gather round, gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full details, see my published works. "Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape," said Lockhart, flashing a wide smile."He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry - you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear!""Wouldn't it be good if they finished each other off?" Ron muttered below his breath.Snape was looking peeved as always, in fact it was astonishing that Lockhart was still up there. If Snape had sent that look at any of his student's they would have fled.The two Teachers turned to face each other, then gave a bow. Well, Lockhart gave a flourishing dip, whereas Snape jerked his head in a facsimile of a bow."As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position," Lockhart told the silent crowd. "On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.""I wouldn't bet on that," Harry murmured, causing Nova to giggle."One - two - three -"Each swung their wands above their heads, before pointing them at their opponent.Snape let out a cry of, "Expelliarmus!"There was a blinding flash of scarlet light, and Lockhart was sent into the wall. He slid to the floor, and a large amount of the Slytherins cheered.Hermione anxiously peered over the surrounding students, "Do you think he's all right?""Who cares?" said Harry and Ron in unison.Lockhart got unsteadily to his feet. Slowly he straightened his robes, ignoring the mess of his wavy hair."Well, there you have it!" he said, tottering back onto the platform. "That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I've lost my wand - ah, thank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see . . ."Every word that came out of Lockhart's mouth caused Snape to look more and more murderous, and Lockhart must have noticed, because he quickly changed topics."Enough demonstrating! I'm going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs. Professor Snape if you'd like to help me -"The two slowly moved through the crowd and partnered everyone up. Harry was forced to fight Draco, and Ron was partnered with Finnigan.Snape turned to look at Gale and Nova, "Lupin, you will be with Mr. Goyle…"Gale felt himself shrink, as he looked to the larger boy. He knew Crabbe and Goyle were not the best magic users, not many second years were, but they were large and willing to use their size against others."Wands at the ready!" shouted Lockhart. "When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don't want any accidents - one ... two ... three -"Gale was quick, muttering, "Expelliarmus."His spell sent the larger boy to the floor, less because of its power, but because of it's disorienting nature. Hesitantly, Gale took a few steps forward and offered Goyle a hand."Stop! Stop!"Gale jerked, Hand snapping back. He raised his head to look towards Lockhart.That was the wrong thing to do, as Goyle charged him, sending them to the floor. His head blossomed with pain, as his head collided with the floor of the Hall. Gale let out a startled yelp, that quickly became a moan of pain.He struggled desperately against the Slytherin, but was unable to escape.Suddenly, Goyle went flying across the room. Gale curled up, looking overt to see who had cast the spell. Nova was there, her wand outstretched with an angry glare directed at the offending Slytherin.She took in a shaky inhale, then offered Gale a hand. With ease he was lifted to his feet beside her, but he stumbled into her, as his head ached. It wasn't to bad, but he would like to at least check in with Madam Pomfrey later.Lockhart wandered out amongst the sea of chaos, helping up a few of the students."I think Id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells," said Lockhart, looking quite flustered. He sent a glance to Snape, "Let's have a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about you -""A bad idea, Professor Lockhart," said Snape, gliding over to stand by Lockhart. "Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending what's left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox." Snape's eyes swept over the hall, until they landed on Harry. "How about Malfoy and Potter?""Excellent idea!" Lockhart exclaimed, gesturing for the two to get on stage.Harry sent Gale and Nova pleading looks, but followed the blonde Slytherin onto the stage. Lockhart got close to Harry and gave him some instructions, dropping his wand in the process."I hate him." Nova commented. Gale nodded; eyes focused entirely on Harry.Lockhart walked away, standing on the edge of the stage, then shouted, "Three - two - one - go!"Draco was the first to raise his wand shouting out, "Serpensortia!"From the end of his wand sprang a long black serpent. It fell to the floor, heavily, and raised itself as if to strike. The nearby onlookers screamed, backpedaling as fast as they could."Don't move, Potter," Snape stated, rising with a small smirk, "I'll get rid of it...""Allow me!" shouted Lockhart.Without pausing to think, Lockhart brandished his wand at the snake, causing a loud bang to erupt. Instead of vanishing, the snake was lifted about ten feet into the air then it fell back to the floor. Enraged the snake hissed, and slithered straight for the nearest student.Harry moved forward, and loud unfamiliar hiss escaped his mouth. His hissing caused the snake to turn and regard him, no longer angered.Harry looked to the student the snake had poised to attack."What do you think you're playing at?"Gale's mouth went dry, and he glanced at his friends. They all looked surprised at Harry's new talent.Nova bolted over to get him, while the other three went straight to the Gryffindor common room. They only had to wait a few minutes for Nova to enter, dragging along a very confused Harry. Gale patiently waited for Harry to sit down, before he jumped right in,"You're a Parselmouth.""I'm a what?" said Harry."A Parselmouth!" Ron repeated. "You can talk to snakes!"Harry shifted, "I know, I mean, that's only the second time I've ever done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I was a wizard -""A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?" Ron repeated faintly."So?" said Harry. "I bet loads of people here can do it." "Oh, no they can't," said Ron. "It's not a very common gift. Harry, this is bad.""What's bad?" said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. "What's wrong with everyone? Listen, if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin -""Oh, that's what you said to it?""What d'you mean? You were there - you heard me -""I heard you speaking Parseltongue," said Ron. "Snake language. You could have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was creepy, you know -"Harry gaped at him, "I spoke a different language? But - I didn't realize - how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?"Ron shook his head. Nova was pensively staring at the burning fire, while Ron and Hermione looked terrified."D'you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin's head?" Harry demanded. "What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn't have to join the Headless Hunt?""It matters, because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. Nova murmured, finally looking at Harry. "That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.""Exactly," said Ron. "And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great-great-grandson or something -""But I'm not," Harry squeaked."You'll find that hard to prove," said Hermione. "He lived about a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be."Gale finally spoke up, "Except I'm pretty sure that the Potter line can be traced back to Godric Gryffindor." He looked to Hermione, "Heroes of the Magical World, Volume II.""Either way, people are still going to talk." Nova said, standing. "Gale, shall we head off to bed?"Gale hesitantly nodded, but he sent Harry a comforting look as he stood."Even if you were related to Salazar, blood does not determine your worth, you do." With a decisive nod, Gale linked arms with Nova and left.As they began towards the Ravenclaw tower, his head let out a sharp pain. He winced and brought up a hand to lightly pet at the sore spot."Can we go to the Hospital wing instead?"Nova's eyes went wide, then they darkened. She gave him a sharp nod but stayed quiet.Only a day later, in the midst of Transfiguration, was there more alarms raised."ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! ATTAAAACK!"The class stumbled to their feet, and Gale found himself shoved to the side.He ended up stuck in the back and could barely see past the chaos in the hall. Harry was standing, eye wide just before the unmoving form of a Hufflepuff boy, and only feet away was the floating form of Nearly Headless Nick. Both had expressions of fear painted across their faces."Caught in the act!" Shouted a nearby Hufflepuff, pointing directly at Harry.Nova shoved past him, to observe the scene."That will do, Macmillan!" said Professor McGonagall sharply. She moved forward to check out the student on the ground. While they were examining them, Peeves broke into song:"Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,You're killing off' students, you think it's good fun -""That's enough Peeves!" barked Professor McGonagall, Peeves zoomed away, with a farewell raspberry to Harry.Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department moved the Hufflepuff student, while the other puzzled out what to do with the stiff ghost. In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan, which she gave to the accusing Hufflepuff with instructions to fan Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. Most of the students followed those two groups, but Nova, Gale and Harry were left standing with Professor McGonagall."Mr. Lupin, Miss Lestrange head back to class." She turned to Harry, "This way, Potter," she said."Professor, I swear I didn't -" Harry tried."This is out of my hands, Potter," said Professor McGonagall curtly.Nova opened her mouth as if to argue, but Gale jabbed her with his elbow."Don't." He hissed, quietly.She growled, irritably, but stayed quiet as Harry and the Professor left them. Gale carefully linked arms with her, then pulled her into an unused classroom."We need to figure out who is doing this." Gale stated.Nova rolled her eyes, "And we have. It's obviously Malfoy.""Draco should be in Defense right now.""So." Nova snapped, "We have no idea how this Slytherin horror works, for all we know he just gives it a weekly itinerary."Gale paused; Salazar Slytherin could talk to snakes. He froze as an epiphany struck him."Nova, I'll be in the Library, I think I have figured it out."He didn't let her respond, as he bolted out the door and down the hall. He raced past some Slytherins, only to be sent sprawling across the floor.Gale simply glared, as he pushed himself back up, and walking the rest of the way to the library.He easily navigated the shelves, looking for the book on snakes. Flipping through the pages he engulfed himself into the notes on magical serpents. He went through quite a few pages before he found the one he thought it had to be.A Basilisk. Sure, a direct look from one of the great beasts could kill someone, but the others had only seen it though something. Mrs. Norris saw it through the water Moaning Myrtle had left. The Gryffindor boy had seen it through his camera, and the Hufflepuff had seen it through a ghost.It even explained the spiders that Hermione had seen.Gale let out a noise of triumph, only to be shushed by Madam Pince. He ducked his head and muttered a soft apology, then slipped his books back where they belonged.He had to glance out the window to try and figure out the time. He nodded when he took in the evening light, and glanced down to check to make sure his books then sent a brief look back to the window.Then Gale noticed something reflecting in the glass that made chills run down his spine. There were large golden eyes peering at him through the glass, and the dark form of a serpent.Everything seemed to freeze, and for a brief moment he could feel himself falling, before everything went dark.

Ginny sat down at the kitchen table and reached for her now-cold cup of tea from breakfast. She sniffed it, it must have been sitting out for hours, but the milk didn't smell sour just yet. She took a tentative sip. It was horrid. She rested her head on her other hand and took another gulp of the tea. She couldn't find her wand to warm it up. Ginny looked down at her elbow, she had placed it directly on top of some remnants of porridge. Wonderful.Ginny scraped off the sticky mess with her fingers and looked around for something to clean her hands with. Merlin's beard, she hated Honey's day off. "Of course, I can handle the boys on my own, Harry. They're my own children, Harry," she mocked herself aloud. She settled for the edge of the table and grimaced as the porridge sunk into the delicate grooving around trim of the table. "They're 5 and nearly 2, not hardened criminals, Harry. It's the mid-season break, Harry. What else am I going to do, Harry?" Ginny finished her tea in two gulps.It was a week into the Quidditch Spring break, and Ginny was already more tired than she'd ever been in her entire life. It felt like every day was a marathon. She was exhausted before 11 every morning and the boys didn't even nap until 1:30. That is, if she could get Jamie to nap at all.Jamie's muggle primary school was off for two weeks for teacher development, so that meant Ginny had both boys all day, every day. She was so tired; she wanted to cry and scream at the same time. Jamie was becoming increasingly hard to entertain. To make matters worse, efforts to wean Al had disastrously backfired. With Jamie, everything had been so easy. Ginny just asked him one day if he was ready to stop nursing and he agreed. Albus, on the other hand, had only become more dependent on Ginny and easily upset if she wasn't available to comfort him at all times.Finally, Ginny heard the floo whoosh from the sitting room. "DADDY'S HOME!" screamed Jamie from the first-floor landing. Jamie rocketed down the stairs at breakneck speeds and tunneled straight for the fireplace."There's my boy!" exclaimed Harry. He knelt down with open arms to catch Jamie's full speed hug. He lifted him into the air for a great hug and bounced him on his hip. Al tottled up to Harry as well and he managed to get both kids in his arms and precariously walked them to the sofa where he dropped them with a playful roar, as was their usual evening routine.Jamie got tickles under the armpits and raspberries blown on his cheeks. His shrieks of joy pierced Ginny's ears painfully. She rubbed her temples and leaned on the wall just outside the sitting room and watched. Harry lifted Al by the ankles and blew raspberries of his tummy."Daddy! No!" he said seriously. "Down!" he demanded. Harry gently lowered Al so he was again flat on his back.Harry tickled Al's bellybutton and asked "Oooh, is it grumpy?" in his best (possibly his worst) accent. It wasn't from any particular region or country; it was simply ridiculous. The boys adored it."No!" Al shouted, pushing Harry's hand away and kicking a single heel into the sofa."Oooh," gasped Harry incredulously, "Did it miss it's nap today?" he asked seriously. "Mr. Potter, you do remember what happens when one doesn't take his naps, do you not? One becomes too grumpy to play with their father when he gets home from work." Harry raised his eyebrow."No!" protested Al."I promise, I speak only the truth, sir," retorted Harry. "But I do hope Mr. Potter isn't too grumpy to play with…" Harry reached behind his back and into his work bag dramatically. "This!" he cried. Harry triumphantly held up a football and displayed it to Al and Jamie."That's a muggle Quaffle!" Jamie announced, "I've seen them at school!""It's called a football, and if you're going to primary school in England, you'd better know how to play, love," said Harry. "Your teacher told us you said you'd never seen one before.""I haven't! Why is it black and white?" asked Jamie, tracing the seams of the hexagons."No idea, but I'm going to teach you how to play after dinner," Harry told him. He patted Jamie on the bum to get him moving. "Come on, think you can help Al set the table?"Jamie nodded enthusiastically. He said, "Come on, Al! I'll show you how to do the forks!" and took off running to the dining room."Ought to keep them busy to 10 minutes," said Harry. "Hi love, how are you?" asked Harry. Ginny didn't answer but begrudgingly allowed Harry to kiss her on the corner of the mouth. She flexed her jaw in frustration."I don't have anything in the oven, so I don't know what you're expecting to eat," replied Ginny."Oh. That's okay, Gin. I'll whip up something fast. What do you feel like? Pasta? Shepard's Pie? Oh, that mustard chicken thing you made last week. That was brilliant.""I don't care," sighed Ginny. She looked around the sitting room for her wand. Pulling her hands through her hair, she realized one of the boys, Al, must have taken and hidden it somewhere."What did you lose?" asked Harry, helping her pull apart and replace the sofa."I didn't lose anything, Harry! Al's hid my wand somewhere," she said with tired patience. Ginny took a steadying breath; it wasn't Harry's fault his children were feral. Or that she was so tired. Or that the boys didn't listen to her."Okay, I'll put spaghetti on the stove and help you look," said Harry. Ginny ground her teeth again and threw the decorative pillows from the armchair on the floor as she groped around the creases of the cushion. Not there either. But she did find several orange slices that were at least four days old.Of course, Harry was being perfectly pleasant when she was in a terrible mood. He was downright cheery. She was half convinced he did this on purpose – be extra nice to her when she was irritable – just to make himself look like the bigger person. The better spouse; the better parent. Here she was, barely able to handle one week staying home with two kids and Harry just came home from work every day, spends two hours with the boys, and that's somehow the same? Sure, he said he was able to handle them on his own when Ginny went touring for away games. Maybe that was all fabricated too. Just so she felt extra terrible when she couldn't do the same. There's no way Harry was able to handle both of them so smoothly on his own. Ginny hadn't been able to make it through a single day this week without locking herself in the bathroom and crying."Love!" called Harry from the kitchen."Yes, dear?" she quipped. It's not his fault. He just got here."Is this your breakfast?" Harry held up a plate of peanut butter toast with a single bite taken out. "Have you not eaten yet today?" he asked astonished."Between the nappy changes, James climbing the curtains – which is a thing now, by the way, tantrums over nursing, and not one, but TWO fist fights, I just haven't had the chance," Ginny retorted. "Love," she added. Her wand wasn't in the kitchen either. Damn it!Harry raised his eyebrows but didn't say anything. He returned he uneaten toast to the table and tended to the browning beef on the stove. "Okay," he turned on his heel and pointed up the stairs. "Come on," he said gently. "Forget your wand. Before the meat starts to burn."Confused, Ginny followed him up two flights of stairs to their bedroom. Harry handed her a banana and cast a muffling charm over the door. Instantly, the racket Jamie was making over glasses and plates vanished. The tension behind Ginny's eyes lessened a bit, but that only brought her attention to the fact that she did, indeed have a headache.Harry pointed his wand at the tub, which began to fill with steaming, vanilla scented water. "Eat this," he instructed. "I'll bring proper food once it's finished. Take a bath or a nap, maybe read a book or whatever. I'll get the kids fed and ready for bed. Just take a few hours off before they drive you mad. I can tell you're at your wit's end.""Al's going to want to nurse before bed," sighed Ginny. She shoved half the banana in her mouth and was surprised at how hungry she was. "And," she said through a full mouth, "Jamie needs to work on his spelling and reading still.""I'll bring Al in here if he asks. But I still think you need to sit down, at least," said Harry. Ginny nodded and peeled off her dirty clothes and sank into the bath. Harry kissed her temple and ran back to dinner, which was definitely starting to burn.By the time Ginny was ready to get out of the tub, Harry reappeared with a plate of spaghetti and a glass of ice water. "Heathens!" he hissed. Harry closed the door behind him and handed Ginny her dinner. "Since when did they start hating each other? I've been home not 20 minutes and they're already both in time out." Harry put his hand on the doorknob again. Al was too little for time out – but she didn't have the energy to argue that right now."About a minute after you left for work," replied Ginny. She sat on the edge of the bed, dressed in only her dressing gown and took a large mouthful of the warm pasta. It wasn't Harry's best work, but she was too hungry to taste much of anything. "They've been naughty all day. It's like they could sense that my patience was running out and turned into…""Heathens?" supplied Harry. Ginny nodded in agreement. "Let's drop them off at your mum's tomorrow and have a lie in," said Harry."I wish," mumbled Ginny."Well at least I'll be home all day tomorrow. We can take them in shifts," said Harry and he left once again.It didn't take long for Ginny to get bored. She was too tired to read or write, and too worked up to sleep. She did, however, find her wand in her handbag. She must have not removed it from last night and forgot with the chaos of the day. Ginny absently flipped through and old copy of Quidditch Quarterly. She stopped short at a photograph of England's 2008 national team. She watched herself give the camera an effortless glance and a cocky sneer.That picture took seven attempts to get right. Ginny was quite the media sensation that year. It was the height of her career. She made the national team after leading the Harpies to their first Championship title in over a decade the previous season. She was the first woman on the national team to also keep her spot in the league – which would have been a big enough deal on its own, but she was also heavily pregnant with Al by the time the World Cup rolled around.England tried to replace her and sue her for breach of contract just two weeks before qualifiers for being too pregnant to compete. However, Ginny was able to not only win her court case but managed to keep her spot after demanding another blind try out. She was undeniably one of the best chasers in all of England and managed to place third in the tournament, losing to Italy but crushing Bulgaria in the semi-finals.How was that only two years ago? It seemed like only yesterday she could be 8 months pregnant and stomping up and down dozens of flights of stairs and barely get winded. Now, she could hardly keep up with two kids. Ginny tossed the magazine across the room towards the bin and massaged her temples. And Harry wanted more. She didn't know if she could do it. Maybe her boys were enough. Some days they even felt like too much.Ginny heard the Harry laughing from the back garden. She sat in the built-in reading nook under the windowsill and opened it even wider."Kick it! Kick the ball, Jamie," encouraged Harry. Jamie tried to pick it up with his hands and throw it at the goal, "No, no with your feet! Watch Al!" Harry lifted a small orange bundle of fluffy outerwear by the arm pits and held him over the football.Al tried to kick the ball, but his boots and snow pants must have been too heavy, because Harry had to end up using him like a makeshift croquet mallet. Ginny snorted to herself."Me next! Me next!" cried Jamie. Ginny smugly waited for Harry to hurt his back from using the kids as life sized foosball pieces. After Jamie's second go round, Harry placed his hand on the small of his back and grimaced. Ginny rolled her eyes from her cozy perch - Harry was nearly 30 but refused to accept his aging body. She quickly grabbed her own coat and headed for the back door.Harry was surprised to see Ginny jogging to the centre of the garden. His cheeks and the tip of his nose were turning pink in the early Spring chill. He smiled brightly and kicked the football in Ginny's direction. She clumsily fumbled and caught it between her feet – she'd never played muggle football either. She returned Harry's pass and was alarmed when the ball rose in the air and flew past Al – only a few inches from his face – with much more force than she'd intended."ermph," grunted Harry as he lunged for the ball to prevent it from smashing into the back fence. "Try with the inside of your foot, higher on the ball," instructed Harry. He demonstrated with a soft, slow pass to Jamie. "Jamie, pass to Mum. No – with your feet, you nut!" Jamie kicked the ball and it curved several feet to Ginny's left. "Good job! You're getting it!" called Harry excitedly.Ginny tried again, kicking the way Harry had and it landed right at Harry's feet – again with more force than she intended but at least she didn't nearly decapitate one of her kids. Harry was trying to get Al's attention, but he was preoccupied with a stick and a bit of mud he found poking through the slush. Ginny sighed, he was going to be terribly upset when he got cold mud on his hands or face.The Potters played in the garden until Harry and Ginny turned their backs to Al for a moment and he lost one of his mittens and his fingers were starting to turn cold and pale. However, it was inconsequential, as the sun was starting to set anyway."Come on! It's Daddy's turn for baths tonight!" said Harry. He lifted Jamie to the top of his shoulders and Ginny took Al's hand. Harry ducked low entering the house so as to not hit Jamie's head on the doorframe. Al fussed and protested his whole way into the tub and Jamie managed to avoid the tub until Ginny all but picked him up and threw him into the toilet. "I got it, have a glass of wine or something," said Harry.Ginny didn't need to be told twice. She grabbed a bottle of her favourite red and sat down on the cleanest part of the cleanest sofa in the sitting room. She lifted her wand to tidy some of the mess surrounding her, but it felt too heavy in her hand and she wasn't sure she had the energy to put away even one toy. Ginny instead popped the cork and poured some wine into a sippy cup that she was pretty sure only had water in it before.Ginny took a sip of the wine and immediately spat it back into the cup. "Ugh!" she gasped and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. She summoned a clean wine glass from the kitchen and poured a small amount of wine into it and took a cautious sniff. It smelled just fine. Ginny inspected the bottle. It was the same kind they always bought. She tried again in the clean glass. It tasted like vinegar that had been left to fester and made her stomach heave and her whole body queasy.Beyond frustrated with her day, she felt tears well up behind her eyes for the second time today, which only frustrated her further. It seemed irrational – really, even though the boys were horrible today, they really weren't that much more energetic than normal. If Jamie wasn't climbing the curtains or fighting with Al for attention, he was finding some other way to get into trouble. And Al has always been a needy baby. She glanced at the wine bottle and another wave a nausea rose up from her stomach and, for just a moment, Ginny worried she would be sick right on the couch.Slowly. Cautiously. Ginny picked up the glass of wine again and headed to the toilet where Harry was bathing the boys. She opened the door to see Harry had rolled up his trousers and was sitting on the edge of the tub washing Al's hair while he played with one of his cousin's baby dolls."Try this," demanded Ginny. She thrust the glass of wine in Harry's face. He balked and reached with a sudded hand."It tastes fine to me… What did you do to it?" asked Harry. He tried to pass it back to Ginny, but she didn't reach for it. Harry, confused, placed the glass tentatively on the side of the tub – Al instantly reached for it and pulled it into the tub. Harry pursed his lips and Al shrieked in laughter while Harry tried to fish the fragile glass from the bubbly water."Nothing. I'm going to the shop. I'll be back in a bit," said Ginny and she turned on her heel and went to grab her handbag."Shops are all closed! It's almost 8!" Harry called after her. She looked at her watch – he was right. Ginny turned on her heel again and raced down the stairs to the fireplace, leaving her handbag where it was."Back soon!""Where are you going?!"Ginny landed on her feet, having done this floo trip a million times before. She stepped into the sitting room on the Burrow. The room was dark, and she didn't hear any noise coming from the kitchen."MUM?!" shouted Ginny. "Mum! I need you!" she called into the darkness. With a graceful arc of her wand, the sitting room was illuminated by dim orange light. She heard shuffling from the first-floor landing."Ginny? Is that you?" her mother's familiar voice called down the stairs."How many other daughters do you have?" snapped Ginny. Molly's head poked around the corner of the staircase. She had just finished knotting her threadbare dressing gown."Calm down, what's the matter?" Molly placed a gentle hand on Ginny's back and led her into the kitchen. Ginny sat down in her regular place at the table and Molly jabbed her wand at the kettle."Ginny?" she heard Dad call from the landing. "Is that you?""Not you Dad!" she called back."Ginny –" chastised Molly."Alrighty, then! You girls have fun!" Arthur called back cheerily. Ginny watched as he hastily retreated back to the master bedroom."I don't want tea," said Ginny calmly. She took a breath, "I need Magdalena's Mixture – I don't have any at home." Molly raised her eyebrows and asked,"You're pregnant?"Ginny sighed through her nose, "I don't know, Mum. That's why I need the Mixture!" she snapped."Well now, don't go getting snippy with me just because you've gone and got yourself in a pinch," said Molly. "I think I have some – ""I didn't get here by myself, Mum!" Ginny nearly shouted. Molly pointed vaguely to the staircase."upstairs under the bathroom sink."Ginny returned almost as quickly as she vanished, holding an old vial of clear liquid in her palm. The label was yellowed and faded. The glass had started to cloud from its years in the humid bathroom. Molly has already set up a small black cauldron in the fireplace. She held up a glass stirring rod when she heard Ginny thumping down the stairs. Ginny snatched it from her hand without looking at Molly and strode angrily into the sitting room. Molly sat and sipped her tea while she waited.With trembling hands and her mind racing, Ginny poured the Mixture into the cauldron. It took several flicks of her wand to light the fire in the hearth. She yanked out several strands of her own hair from the root and toss them into the cauldron. She stirred with the glass stirring rod, counting under her breath. Another wipe of her wand to kill the flames, a couple more taps to cool the now milky white Mixture to room temperature.A silent hand reach from behind her shoulder. Out of the corner of her eye she could see her mother smugly handing her a drinking glass. Ginny filled the glass with a generous amount of the Mixture. The perfumey smell of oranges made her gag when she thought of the old orange slices that she'd found in the armchair earlier. Molly smirked. Ginny glared as if daring her to say something."I thought you were still nursing?" asked Molly.Ginny didn't answer, she took in a mouthful of Magdalena's Mixture and her eyes fluttered closed. "Well?" she heard Molly ask. Ginny took in another mouthful. It tasted overwhelmingly of rosehip, jasmine, peach, and cherry. The sheer sweetness of the Mixture made Ginny's mouth prickle and salivate."I'm going to kill him," she announced. Ginny pulled the cauldron from the fireplace with one hand and cradled the glass by the top in the other. She yanked on the old cauldron hook, but it refused to budge from the fireplace."Ginny be sensible. This is a good thing!" cheered Molly."No, Mum it isn't!" Ginny had to set the glass down and yanked on the hook apparatus with both hands. It still was unyielding. "I can barely handle the two that I do have. I'm too tired; too busy for another one!" Ginny felt heat rise in her throat and her eyes start to burn. The ash she was kicking up wasn't helping her keep her tears in check either. "Some of us aren't built for seven kids," she chocked out. Angrily, she wiped tears from her cheeks. Ginny had never felt so betrayed by her own body, or so out of control over what was happening to her."Ginny…" Molly tried to soothe."I told him I wasn't ready yet. He did this on purpose!" she cried. Ginny stepped on the hinges of the hook with the back of her heel. In her haste to leave the house, she didn't even put on shoes."Ginevra!" said Molly sharply. Ginny, startled, snapped her attention from the infuriating hook in the fireplace. "You and I both know that is not true. And to accuse Harry of such a thing is barbaric and unfair." Molly place her hands on her hips, "sit down, have a cup of tea with me and calm down.""I don't want tea!" cried Ginny as threw her hands up. She sighed, "I don't want tea. I just – I just want my husband," she said determinedly. Molly nodded and waved her wand at the hook which neatly folded itself up and placed itself in the cauldron. Ginny picked up her glass and placed her palm firmly over the top to prevent any of it from spilling on her journey home."It's been a bit sticky these last few years," said Molly gently. She kissed Ginny on the cheek. "Everything is going to be just fine. You'll see," promised Molly.Ginny's sitting room was not how she left it. Confused, she looked around and checked her watch. Honey wasn't due back until late this evening - yet the place was spotless. All the toys and books were out of sight, the small handprints had been removed from the glass on the French doors that lead to the back garden. The mysterious stain on the couch was even gone.The kitchen was more of the same, bits of macaroni were being swept up by the old straw broom and the dishes were doing themselves over the sink. She'd only been gone 20 minutes, surely Harry hadn't had the time to do all of this."Harry?" she called up the stairs. She saw his smiling face pop out of Al's room. He placed a finger to his lips to quiet her and waved Ginny to him. When she reached the top of the stairs, she saw Harry standing against the doorframe looking into the dark room.Ginny couldn't help but smile at the sight. Jamie was flat on his back in Al's bed, mouth agape, right arm hanging off the bed. Al was curled up beside him using Jamie's belly as a pillow and wearing a children's book at a hat. They were both dead asleep. Ginny leaned against Harry's chest and he curled his arms around her and gently whispered in her ear, "I had Jamie start reading a bed-time story while I set the kitchen straight. I came back 10 minutes later to this."Ginny turned and frantically patted Harry's chest with the back of her hand. She was still coving the Mixture with both hands. "Camera," she whispered. Harry grinned and held up his hand."Got it," he winked. "Where did you go – What is this?" he pointed at the glass Ginny was still holding. Ginny gestured down the hall and Harry followed her march to their bedroom."Sit." she demanded.That's not what I think it is, is it?" asked Harry cautiously. He sat tentatively at the edge of the bed. Ginny uncovered the top of the glass with her hand and the pungent smell of oranges filled the room. Ginny gagged again, this time feeling bile rise in her throat. "NO!" breathed Harry, eyes wide in both shock and fear."Drink it.""Noooo… No, you're joking," Harry rose to his feet abruptly. "You must be joking," he insisted. Ginny thrust the glass into his hand, crossed her arms, and leaned back on one foot."Drink that and tell me if it's funny.""What, did you also poison it?" laughed Harry uncomfortably. Ginny stared at him, unblinking. The uneasy smile faded from Harry's lips and he cautiously took in the smallest amount of Mixture he could."You... Are. Pregnant!" stammered Harry. Ginny watched him breathe out a steady breath from his mouth. Ginny nodded. "Is that peach?!" asked Harry, his voice rising an octave. He took another, larger sip. "Ahhh, and cherry. Good. Two - Two fruits!" he announced. "You are very pregnant," said Harry, enunciating his words.Ginny covered her eyes with her hand and her shoulders started to shake with silent sobs. "No, no, Love! Don't cry," soothed Harry. "Listen. I'm happy, I am. I'm just shocked, that's all," said Harry. He sat down on the bed, gently taking Ginny's hands in his own and looked into her eyes. "Just with how long the last one took – I just… I… didn't expect… You've not been sick, or… I am happy.""I'm not!" cried Ginny, "I can't do it. There's too many of them and they're awful!""I'll quit my job," said Harry. Ginny sat beside Harry and he turned his body to face her. "I'll take parental leave and the four of us could follow you around for away games.""Two kids under three! Oh, Merlin!" Ginny ran her hair through her fingers. "You can't quit, you're head of the department.""We'll sell Grimauld place and hire an army of nannies," promised Harry. His face was starting to brighten. "One for each kid, and one for us. I think it's our turn to have someone bring us snacks and wipe our arses." Ginny laughed, "I'm serious," Harry told her, "We can make this work. I – I – I don't know how," he stammered, "but we can make it work. I'm sure of it.""I've been so tired," sniffed Ginny.Harry kissed her knuckles, "I did notice that, at least," he laughed. "How are you –" Harry took another taste of the Mixture, just to be sure. Harry placed a hand on Ginny's abdomen. "How are you this pregnant? What is peach and cherry? Like 5… 5 months?!""I think well into the second quarter… 16… 17 weeks?" guess Ginny. Harry did the maths in his head."Four months? No! That can't be right. Give me your belly!" laughed Harry. Ginny laughed with him and leaned back on one hand, raising her shirt. Harry rubbed her belly curiously, moving his head from one side of her to the other. "Where are you hiding him? Are you sure that's right?" he asked.Ginny's eyebrows raised, "Shit. Mum's Mixture was ancient. Does it go bad?" Ginny frowned and looked down at her stomach. After Al, she still wasn't able to get it to go flat. No matter how hard she worked out, she always curved slightly starting all the way from the bottom of her sternum. This immensely bothered Ginny. She was a professional athlete with abs, for Godric's sake! Visible abs, and she still didn't have a flat tummy! Harry insisted he liked it, to her annoyance. But he was right, her belly was no different now than it was three months ago. Ginny laid back on the bed, knees hanging off the edge. She rubbed her abdomen with both hands – if anything, it was only a bit harder.Harry grimaced, "I don't know. I hope not, I'm already excited, maybe the dates are just off a bit, though," suggested Harry. "Maybe it's twins!" he gasped."No." demanded Ginny."Fine," sighed Harry."You promise you're excited?" asked Ginny. She scooted up to her pillows."I want as many kids as you're willing to give me, Gin," said Harry earnestly, lying on his side next to her. His free hand still on her belly. "Admittedly, it's cutting it a little close if we both want to keep our jobs – but frankly, I like my kids better than I like work.""Seriously, though!" insisted Harry, "Where are you hiding him?! You're too ripped - he can't get out! He's stuck, Gin!" cried Harry with false alarm. Harry nudged his way down to Ginny's belly "Hello?!" he called into her bellybutton and pressed an ear to her abdomen. "Hello, Baby Potter? Don't panic! I'll have your Mum stop doing sit ups! Remain calm!"Ginny was laughing so hard it became difficult to breathe. She grabbed a pillow from behind her head and threw it at Harry. "Stop it, you absolute nutter!"Harry army crawled back to his place by Ginny's head. "What? You like when I talk to the baby," teased Harry.Ginny grabbed his face between her palms and squeezed slightly and said sincerely, "You know, you are the only person in the world who can take me from a near nervous breakdown to laughing in a matter of minutes."Harry kissed her palm lightly. He rested his head on Ginny's chest and shrugged. Ginny closed her eyes and ran her fingers though Harry's hair. She saw the lights flicker off from under her closed eyelids. "You do the same for me," mumbled Harry. "We'll make this work Gin, you'll see. I won't let you get worn down and miserable," promised Harry.Ginny was nearly asleep when she heard Al's cry from his room down the hall. She sighed and went to get him before Harry stopped her. "I'll get him," he said. Harry rubbed her belly before pulling himself out of bed. "I'll see if I can't get him to settle without your boob." Ginny nodded and snuggled under the covers, stripping her clothes in the process."Get some sleep, Mama. You earned it."

I, I loved you in secretFirst sight, yeah, we love without reasonHarry sighed softly, gazing longingly towards the Hufflepuff table, where a certain bronze-haired boy sat, laughing. He knew that there was something odd about the way he felt about Cedric Diggory - he saw the boy as beautiful, like the girls did. He saw the boy as endearing, like the girls did. He saw Cedric as something beyond a friend, like the girls did. Harry wasn't a girl, but he liked boys the way girls liked boys.He should have liked girls. That was the way things should have been. Harry was a boy, so he should like girls. Harry was a boy. But he didn't like girls.He liked boys.

Harry looked around amazed. It was all red and gold and browns, and he didn't think he had ever seen something so old yet so expensive that wasn't Aunt Petunia passing some cheap thing off as that. He looked around and saw five beds, and there were five boys. He had a bed, an actual bedding, pillow covered bed. It was all his, and he had a wardrobe without a broken door and a nightstand that wasn't covered in marker from his cousin. Was this a joke?He looked around at all his roommates and saw they were all going to a bed he assumed they saw had their trunk and that left Harry with the one by the window. He went to it and saw his trunk was already unpacked, and he worried a little before he found he had everything still and all his… well his cousin's clothes were hanging up. He just hoped the other boys wouldn't notice how threadbare they were.The others were getting into pajamas, so Harry followed along just trying to figure out how all of this worked. He didn't feel comfortable changing in front of everyone, so he hopped on his bed and closed the curtain around him while he changed. He felt weird about that being it so he peeked out and said goodnight to everyone before closing them up and lying down on the bed, confused of how he was supposed to sleep there. He tried all limbs out on his back, on his stomach, curling up on each side, but there just wasn't the guard of all walls and no space like in his cupboard. It just felt so off.He waited for an hour or so before everything was quiet except for the light breathes and snores of his roommates. Once he was sure to be alone, he crept out of his bed with his pillow and the blanket at the foot of his bed. He looked around the room before finding a little alcove by his bed next to a window. A nice draft would remind him of his cupboard well enough to make the lack of a fourth wall no problem.He curled up beside the window, his head on his pillow and the blanket cocooned around him snuggly. He watched the window outside, hoping it would help him to fall asleep, when he saw a white blurry shape flying around outside. He opened the window having an inkling of who it was out there. He heard the hoots of his owl, and then she was there nipping at his hair and hooting happily. Harry wanted to giggle from the nice feelings she brought him, but he instead calmed her down so she wouldn't wake his roommates. The owl calmed, and they both ended up snuggled against the wall watching the dark world outside as they fell asleep.The next thing he knew he was being shaken awake by a hand. He flinched away almost certain he was back on Privet Drive and the wizarding world had all been a dream. He looked up into the face of a shaken Ron Weasley, and Harry felt his embarrassment reach down into his stomach and wrench. Ron looked at him weirdly as he backed away, but the concern eased some of Harry's shame. "Whatcha doin' here Harry?"Harry stood up, looking around for a moment for Hedwig before seeing the open window and figuring she had left already for an early morning snack. He closed the window, putting off answering for a little while longer. He turned back around with his blanket clasped tightly in his fist. "Um, couldn't sleep, you know?"Ron's weird look faded into understanding, and he nodded his head in what had to be empathy. "Yeah, I gotcha, mate. I missed my family too, you know."Harry felt just a tad bad for leading Ron on like he was, because he knew Ron probably did feel that way, but Harry… He couldn't miss what he'd never had, or at least, that was what he had always told himself. "Yeah, well, what time is it? We should be getting ready, right?"Ron nodded and stepped away, already focusing on something else. "Right, right, we definitely, need breakfast."Harry nodded as Ron took off on getting ready. He put away his things from sleeping and made his barely mussed bed before finding his own school clothes and heading for the loo to get dressed. He came out a few minutes later fully dressed and ready for whatever this new school would bring him. The other four boys were likewise ready, and they all decided to head down together.They made it to the Great Hall without being too lost. All five sat together at the end of the table closest to the staff table and started to load their plates. Harry used caution and discretion when deciding what to eat and decided on some dry toast and some milk to drink. He was about to tuck into some food when he felt eyes on him. He looked up to the staff table and saw Professor Snape studying him. He didn't know the best response for this type of attention from a teacher, so he smiled and nodded his head to the man. The man looked taken aback and recoiled slightly, and Harry shrugged it off as it was just the same response he got back in Surrey. He tucked into his food, paying no more mind to the eyes of the teacher.SNAPESeverus could not understand why the Potter boy had smiled at him. He had not been in the boy's presence enough to be completely horrible to the boy, but someone had to have told him how evil he was as a teacher. He was vicious with his snipes and scowls causing multiple children to cry in a single class, and this child, a first year, dares to smile and nod at him, like his mother, the boy smiled like his mother.He kept observing the boy throughout the morning meal. The boy ate like a wounded animal with the appetite of a sickly bird. Severus could admit, if only to himself, how worried that made him as he watched the young boy look longingly at other food but take none. The boy was too small to have eaten so little. He was shorter than the Finnigan boy, and almost the same height as the bushy-haired muggleborn girl. Thin as a rail, but he looked so cheerful, but that could be because he was here.He would have to watch the boy closely and maybe talk to him, but if he had to do that, he could not be horrible to a boy he had never met. Severus would have to rethink his first lesson with that year. Who else needed a dressing down this year? Not his Slytherins with the reputation he had to uphold. The Gryffindors were his only other choice, and of the lot, it could be the Weasley boy, or possibly another, but honestly it could wait for later.He rose from his seat and arched a brow when a hand grabbed at his wrist. He turned toward the old man in the eccentric robes and the twinkling eyes. "Headmaster?"The old wizard smiled, only Severus could read through those smiles to the eyes, those cunning all-knowing eyes that seemed to spark with condescension. He had worked under his second master for over twelve years now, and it had been a fast realization that the old man with the best intentions tended to treat people more like marionettes in his big play with no regard for the lives he ruined with his decisions. "Where are you going, my boy?"Severus clenched his hand s in warning when the man did not let go. He lost patience quickly and pulled away from the withered hand. "To prepare, Headmaster?"The old brow wrinkled as if confused, but Severus knew the old man was faking it. "For what, Severus?"Severus could not hold back from rolling his eyes at the intrusive old meddler. "Classes, Headmaster. I do have those today.""Of course, Severus. I do wish you would call me Albus," the Order head said with a frown.Severus hardly had enough time for this drivel. "I need to go, Headmaster."Severus swept away from the old wizard before he could say more and distract him from leaving longer. He went down the center aisle past the Potter boy who thought he was getting up after only having eaten a piece of toast. Severus used wandless magic to send some light fruit on the boy's plate and push the boy back into his seat all without any indication in his work toward the boy's health. He felt the green eyes on him as he left, he just could not stop to see what they'd say about his actions.

Chapter TwoHarry found it easy to fail to mention why he had to eat what was on his plate while he and Ron ran to class. He had seen the food just appear to move onto his plate of its own volition and then a force he could not explain pushed him back down into his seat without a hand on him. He had turned to see Professor Snape stalking the center aisle on his way out of the Great Hall without looking his way, but somehow he could tell it was the Professor. He just knew it.He ate the food, and then he and Ron ran to find the Transfiguration classroom. That class ended up being pretty brilliant, the teacher was his Head of House, and she seemed really good at teaching if a little strict. He was a little put out to be late to the class and make a bad impression, but he knew he had had to eat the food on his plate.They were walking down the hall when Harry turned to ask Ron where their next class was after lunch. He hit something solid with an 'oof' before falling on his bum, hard enough to bruise he was sure. He had had worse and there was no reason to cry. He heard laughter and looked up to see he'd ran into a large Slytherin boy he was pretty sure was named Gregory. He blushed as he was getting to his feet. The laughter came from the right once more, and he saw it was Malfoy.Harry blushed harder at the derision in his voice and looked down. He turned in the direction of Gregory and smiled apologetically. "Sorry about that, Gregory. I wasn't looking."The boy seemed to respond with shock while Malfoy had stopped laughing and was now glaring. The bigger boy just nodded at Harry dazedly. Harry smiled a little more at the acknowledgement before he felt a push to his shoulder. He only stumbled a little this time before he felt Ron grab his arm to steady him as he flinched. "That was a dirty move, Malfoy," Ron shouted.Harry really wished he wouldn't fight his battles for him. "Why can't you see where you're going, Potter? You have four eyes or is it the lack of brain that has you at a loss or does it make you too stupid to get glasses?"Harry glared, feeling his cheeks heat up. He couldn't really see out of his glasses, but they were the only ones he had, and it wasn't like it was his choice. "Shut-up, Malfoy," Ron growled, stepping in front of Harry like some older brother.Harry fought off a blush, feeling like such a baby having his best friend keep sticking up for him. As nice as the gesture was, Harry was eleven, not eight, he was a Gryffindor, he could face Malfoy, but really he didn't want to get in trouble for fighting. He carefully touched Ron's shoulder, still unaccustomed to being allowed to initiate physical contact with anyone, and the boy spun on him quicker than Harry's reflexive flinch appreciated. "What, Harry?"Harry gestured the other way from the Slytherins. "We should go, Ron. They aren't worth getting in trouble."The larger boy looked outraged. "They pushed you, Harry, and made fun of you."Harry sighed aloud. He didn't really mind being pushed around or even taking a few words about himself. He knew what he was and how little of anything that was, and he was used to it, but he could see Ron wasn't and that letting this go would hurt the larger boy's pride, but Harry just didn't pride himself enough for all of that. "It doesn't matter, Ron. Besides, I ran into them, and we could be late to lunch."The redhead looked confused before seeming to come to a decision. Harry tried not to shake too hard as the boy's arm came to his shoulder, as friendly as it was he was not ready for contact with anyone yet. "Okay, mate, we'll go."They turned to walk, going around the Slytherin boys, when Harry tripped over the foot Malfoy had stuck out in the last second. Harry tripped and fell hard his whole body unprepared and taking a punishment. His knees and hands scraped the cold stone, and he whimpered as his face smashed the surface. He already felt the thick, acrid blood rolling down his lips.SnapeSeverus was stalking the corridors worried. The Potter boy was late for lunch along with the newest of the Weasley clan, Potter's newest compatriot. He wasn't being pushy, but he knew the boy wasn't well liked by Slytherin house, and it just so happened, un-coincidentally, that the Malfoy scion and the Goyle boy were missing as well.He stalked toward the path they'd have taken from Minerva's class when he heard a whimper and turned the next corner, finding the Potter boy bleeding on the ground, the Weasley boy with his want out, and his two Slytherins glaring with Malfoy's wand trained on Weasley. He felt his blood pressure rise. "What is going on here?" he hissed.The two wand wavers jolted, jerking their wands down, while Goyle just stared dumbly. Severus sighed, calling their wands to him for now, before turning to Potter. The poor boy had scraped through his trousers and his hands looked bloody while his nose was pouring blood. The child seemed so unaffected (worryingly so) as he pinched his nose and tilted his head back flawlessly. "Alright, Potter?" he found himself asking.The boy started to nod but must have realized his folly. "Yes, sir."Severus rolled his eyes. "That doesn't seem likely, Potter. You're bleeding all over the stone floors."The boy blushed and looked away. "Sorry, sir. I've had worse though, so I'll be fine. I'll even clean it up. I swear…"Severus held up a hand to stop the little twit from saying anymore foolish promises. He was too angry to get into everything the boy revealed, but for now he could address the group. "Get together your things, all of you, and follow me."Severus gathered the Potter boy's things with a spell and reached over to help him to his feet when the child flinched away from him. Snape backed off quickly, holding up his hands. The boy was shaking, but he looked more nervous and embarrassed than scared. Severus took that in, deciding it was a reflex. He's have to dissect this interaction later.He offered a hand this time and helped the hesitant boy to his feet. He turned to look at the other three with a glare, keeping his reputation with them at least and nodded forward as he walked with Potter. He kept watching as the boy glared at him curiously, He didn't acknowledge the attention, but he didn't ignore it either.They made it to his office, and he ushered them in, spelling two extra chairs for his Slytherins on the other side of the two he left for the Gryffindors. The three not bleeding sat down, and Severus gave each his harshest glare and watched them all gulp before turning to Potter. " , go through that door there and wait for me on the table."The boy seemed hesitant, but he followed orders easily going to the other room. Severus turned on the others, striding over to them with a glare. "What happened?"The Slytherins looked pale and confused when his glare included them. The redhead, who was at that moment red faced, looked like his Gryffindor bravery wanted him to speak up."Harry ran into Goyle and fell, and then Malfoy pushed him and made fun of him and his glasses. Then Harry made us leave, but Malfoy tripped him when we walked by making him hurt."Severus started thinking of innocent, loving green eyes and blood. His veins felt icy. "Mr. Malfoy, is this true?"The boy looked offended and then smug. "Of course not," foolish young thing was not Slytherin enough to conceal emotions or lies. "Potter did bump into us, but we never hurt him."Severus could feel the lie in his bones, but the curious thing was Goyle's face. He seemed guilty, and so seeing this opening, Severus turned on him. "Is that your story as well, Mr. Goyle?"The boy shook his head. "No, sir. Potter did fall after running into me, and Weasley was telling the truth. Draco was teasing Potter and tripped him."Severus could feel the shock and pride roll through him together. The boy had stood up for good, but why? He would ask after. He turned his glare on Malfoy. "Mr. Malfoy, bullying, lying, and hurting another student. I believe three weeks of detention with me and a thousand lines will make a mark on your misbehavior. Mr. Weasley, a detention tonight for pulling your wand on another student served with Mr. Malfoy for the same."The two looked ready to argue, but Professor Snape held up a hand and gestured to the door. "You two may go."The boy's grumbled as they both took their wands and left, the Weasley boy seeming undecided about his friend. "Don't worry, Mr. Weasley, Mr. Potter's wounds will be tended."The boy nodded confused and followed the blonde Slytherin out. Severus turned again on Goyle. "Mr. Goyle, why did you tell on Mr. Malfoy?"The boy shrugged, seeming just as unintelligent and slow as ever. "Potter apologized to me and was kind and he tried to leave us alone. Draco is never like that. He even called me Gregory. Potter did. Doesn't mean I like him, but I owed the truth I guess."Severus nodded and gestured to the door. "You may go, and let me know if Mr. Malfoy gives you trouble, Mr. Goyle."The boy nodded slowly and left out the door. Severus sighed and rubbed down his face, wondering how long he'd be going over the day's events in his head. He shook away the thoughts and walked to the other door in the room, where he sent Potter. The boy jumped when he entered before looking down guiltily. As much as Severus detested any legilimency without someone's knowledge, he truly wanted to with Harry to see what had happened to him, but the boy made it impossible by always looking down so meekly. He pondered why the child who followed so meekly as he had instructed. "Well, Mr. Potter, why aren't you sitting on the table?"The boy blushed and hunched up at the shoulders before peering up slowly to meet his eyes. "I'm sorry, sir. I was too short to get up, sir."Severus raised his eyebrows in displacement before measuring the boy to the table. He shook his head at himself seeing the table only reach above the boy's armpits. (Of course, he couldn't reach, he's small and thin.) He tried to twitch a lip up into a smile to ease the boy, but he hardly succeeded to perform the action. He'd have to practice. "Well, that's fine then, Potter. Would you mind if I picked you up?"

Chapter ThreeHarry didn't think his mouth was open, but it was a close thing as the Professor, who people called menacing and scary, attempted to smile while asking to pick him up. He knew he had to look confused and scared, but he was so unsure what was about to happen. He couldn't understand if this was a trick like at the Dursley's, but he didn't think so when the frowny Professor was trying to smile just for him. He nodded shakily and reached up his hands to the man. The man looked pained and sad before the attempt at a smile was back as the man reached for him.Harry held back his flinch, but his eyes closed and his body shook as the man reached under his arms and lifted him into the air. He tried not to panic or squirm fearing it would make it worse, but all his worries were for nothing as the man gently set him down on the table. He opened his eyes wide feeling shocked it wasn't a trick. He had trusted the man, and it wasn't a trick. His eyes widened, and he stared at the man in awe. Was this how adults were supposed to be or was Professor Snape just not aware of what a freak he was?The man picked out a stool from under the table Harry sat as Harry took his hands into each other and rung them nervously. Harry knew from the books he read that the little bottles he took out were potions and from Percy that that was what the Professor taught. But, Percy also said that the Professor fancied the DADA position, which Harry wasn't sure if that was true anymore after seeing how wrong everyone else was about the Professor.He eyed the bottles warily as the man set them out beside him. They all looked kinda icky and thick, which didn't sound like it'd be good to take. The man's eyes turned on him and seemed to soften slightly looking at him. Harry locked eyes with the man before he felt a pinch behind his eyes. It was in the next second that the Professor snapped out of the stool and sent it careening backwards, causing Harry to flinch violently from letting his guard down.He uncurled slightly and looked up to see the man's face pinched in anger, resentment, and sadness, but Harry didn't know why he'd look like that, unless it was something Harry did. Was he bad, freakish? He had to know so that he could be… apologize to the man. He looked away and cleared his throat to try and prevent his stuttering. "I'm sorry, sir."The man's face slackened, clearing of emotion like pond water after a ripple. The man shook his head slowly. "No, Mr… Harry, I'm not aggravated at you. I-I would like to speak to you tonight though after classes."Harry was shocked at first, a detention. He had a detention on the first day. He felt like a failure. How had he messed up so badly. "I-I'm sorry, sir, really. I-I tried not…"Harry cut himself off, excuses never worked with adults, not even when he'd done the right thing or even did nothing at all. He was the one in the wrong, and he was not to blabber and keep on about his innocence because no one could believe a lying freak."What, Mr. Potter, are you apologizing for?"Harry perked up, looking at the man. Why was he confused? He had just given him a time for his punishment. He was bad that was all that mattered, even if Harry didn't know why. He was still bad. Now he felt confused too. "Sir, you just gave me detention…"The man sighed, using slow movements to wipe his face like he was tired. He could be for all Harry couldn't tell since the man always looked the same, except when he tried to smile. "No, Harry. No. I just wanted to speak with you tonight, not a detention as you have done nothing wrong. It's going to be about your home, Harry."Harry felt his body lock up and his heart stop. What about his home? There was n-nothing wrong. No, he didn't need to talk about it. Especially with the Professor, who was still treating him like he wasn't a freak. If he heard… it would all be over. And if they found out… he just couldn't. "Sir, I-I r-really d-don't n-need t-to…" he cleared his throat to rid himself of his stuttering, "I swear. It's fine."The man raised an eyebrow looking at him so condescendingly Harry flushed. "That makes me think differently, Harry."His head was shaking before the man was finished. "No, please, it's nothing."The man shook his head firmly, leveling him afterward with a stern frown. "Just come back tonight, Harry. We'll only talk."Harry nodded, thinking that after this he would never be able to eat today, not with how bad his stomach was knotting. "Good, now, drink your potions while I put this Murtlap on your scrapes."Harry nodded, drinking the potions down, trusting the Professor to take care of his pains. Besides, Ron knew where he was, and he was sure the Professor could have hurt him by now anyway.The Professor was really gentle while tending to him. Even the school nurse who was so kind to him when he was eight wasn't this gentle with him. Back then he had imagined his mother in her place, giving his boo boos a kiss, making it all better. While the Professor gently dabbed his scrapes but firmly held either his arms or hands to steady him, he imagined he was seeing his dad, and as the man patted him on the thigh, telling him, "You'll be fine now, Harry." All Harry could imagine was his dad saying the same and looking at him so kindly. His eyes filled with tears.SnapeSeverus was unsure as to when, but Harry was crying, and alarmingly, he could not recall if that was the first time the boy had become Harry in his mental narrative. It could have been just now looking at the boy with tears falling that he softened his perception of the child, or maybe when he began calling him Harry to ease the boy's instinctive wariness, but the problem was he was unsure which one was the truth. Copious times Severus has reevaluated and realized that tonight would be a long one if he had to go into his shields to dissect all the happenings of the day.He heard a slight wisp of a sniffle that drew him back to the child, who cried so contrary to other children. There was no noise, no heavy breathing, just sad tears, and a look of longing in too green eyes. The child became preoccupied once more allowing Severus to take a moment to delve yet again into the boy's mind. He saw what brought this on from past and present, the comparisons of kindness to his parents made Severus wish the child could have known life with James and Lily Potter, if only to know how easily love flowed in that house. He felt his blackened heart tighten for Lily's boy, a lonely boy treated by so many without love. The child seemed so starved for affection, safety, and love from an adult, and Severus was struggling to see how anyone could deny such a thing from the child.Seeing the boy as he did now, he could no longer see Lily and James Potter, standing in the place of their child, who was quite obviously his own person, but he did see parts of them and himself in the boy. It was a sobering assessment of the boy that allowed him to see for himself how unfairly he had been to the child in the past to expect the boy to be his father or his mother. It was unfair to the boy, and it was unfair to the memory of the friendship he had with Lily. He would be better to the child.He reached out a slow hand and grabbed the boy's shoulder gently before pulling the child forward. They were inches apart when Severus made his attempt at a smile and looked into those green eyes with sincerity. He was uncertain how to say this, but he would have to tap into his unused emotional maturity. "I wish I could have had a son as sweet, smart, and brave as you, Harry. Your own parents would have been as proud to have seen the boy you are today. I am just sorry that you never got to experience that for yourself."Severus watched the boy shake as he nodded to Severus, spilling more tears down his cheeks as a smile shown on his reddened face. The boy pulled away from him, showing his reluctance in the way his body angled toward Severus, unconsciously or not, seeking comfort in the man. Too many actions from the boy were alarming and wrong for his age, and even the possibility of another arrogant bully was a better thought for Severus than the alternative of another abused child.The boy had finished crying and was wiping his eyes with his cloak. Severus tutted and held up his handkerchief, allowing the boy to reach on his own rather than to cause another reflexive flinch from the obviously upset child. He was also not looking forward to the way his blood would boil at the thought of why the boy had to develop that reflex. He watched as the boy wiped his eyes and held the handkerchief with unease. Severus patted the child's foot to calm the unease before it escaped the boy's emotional grasp since they both had classes soon and the boy still had to eat, they had no time to waste on more tears. Their initial meeting was coming to an end soon, meaning he needed to speed along.He went to his desk, writing in a note to tell the teacher that 'Potter' (he needed to remember to use Potter) had been discussing a detention. He had no need to ruin his reputation with the teachers or the students. He could admit that he would allow it with Harry, but that was it. He turned to see the boy still holding the handkerchief like it would bite him. "Keep the handkerchief, Harry, and you will stop using your clothes to wipe away whatever happens to get on you, do I make myself clear?"The child nodded before sticking the handkerchief into a robe pocket and looking back to Severus with a smile. How a hanky could please the boy, Severus would never know. He sent an order to the kitchens before moving back to his charge. "Now, Harry, you will sit on that stool and eat the lunch I have ordered you at as slow a pace as necessary before I send you to your next class with a note to pardon your absence. Understand?"The boy looked ready to argue, a change of pace, but instead of his typical angry glares, Severus sent the boy a muted stern glare that deflated the boy easily. Severus smirked as he went over to the boy and picked him up just to plop him down onto the stool he had been sitting at during their discussion. The lack of flinching and shaking from the boy reassured him they were coming forward in their interactions. He would just have to be patient.He left the boy on the stool, trusting the calm, quiet boy to sit still in his lab while he called a house elf and had it bring some porridge with fruit and honey for the boy with milk to drink. He was going to have the keep the meals light for the boy since he had barely eaten anything beyond table scraps for most of his life. He returned to the boy just as the food arrived and sat on one of his other stools near the child but far enough away to put him at ease.He watched out of the corner of his eye as the child ate slowly. He could discern quickly the boy's lack of coordination with the cutlery. He could imagine how they must have made him eat, but thinking on it was only going to make him angrier. He would just have to teach the boy himself. He would bring it to the boy's attention if he was not so sure that the knowledge would make the boy stop eating from embarrassment. He would have to wait for more trust and a better time.The child finished more than half before putting down the silverware and glancing warrily between the bowl and Severus. Severus only nodded his head to the milk, and like the good child Severus was finding the boy to be, he chugged it down obediently. With his small countenance, Severus would not have suggested that, but the boy needed the calcium. The boy turned to him with a nervous smile on his lips and those skeleton like hands fluttering. "T-thank you, sir. I was pretty hungry, I guess. Um, w-will I need to go clean up that blood before class?"Severus hid the exasperation he felt from the child as he shook his head. The boy really was too good or possibly trained for his own health. "No, Harry, house elves have already most likely done so. You only need worry about getting to class, understand?"The boy's brow furrowed before he flushed and stared at him own swinging feet. "Uh, sir, I don't know who I have next."Severus's brow arched at his confusion. How would the boy not know what class he has next? Did he not receive a schedule? Had Minerva really been that remist in her Head of House duties as to not hand out schedules and maps to her first years? Was she really that inadequate? If so, they would be having a conversation soon, but first, the boy."Did you not receive a schedule, Harry?"HarryHarry felt his whole body flush. He couldn't tell the man he couldn't see, he'd make fun of him just like Malfoy did. "Uh, Ron has it, sir."The man's eyebrows rose in belittlement again, and Harry felt his eyes water while his temper rose. He really didn't want the only kind adult he had met here to make fun of him. "Harry, why would Mr. Weasley have your schedule?"Harry realized there would be no mocking, just condescension. It made his temper flare a bit more. It wasn't a stupid idea to leave the bloody thing with Ron when he couldn't even see what was written on the bloody paper. "I can't see it, sir," he muttered to his feet.The man tapped his shoulder, and Harry looked up to see confusion pass over the man's face and leave in its place caution. "You can't read, Harry?"Harry looked at the man in outrage and felt hurt deeper down. "No! I can read! I'm not stupid!" he said as his anger started to fizzle out. "I-I just can't see the words… they… they just look all blurry," he muttered to the man's feet this time.He received the tap to his hands and realized they were intertwined again. He pushed them away from each other and looked back to the man. His professor nodded and moved slowly to stick his hand out to Harry. Harry appreciated how slow and deliberate the man moved as it kept him from worrying about the need to avoid a hit by flinching. "Hand me your glasses, Harry," the man said to Harry's surprise.He felt nervous about handing over the only glasses he had ever had. They were his only way to see even a small amount better. Without them he couldn't even walk without bumping into things. "Harry, I only want to fix them where you may see and then this weekend we will go get you new glasses," the man interrupted his train of worry.Harry's face slackened and his mind scrambled to comprehend what the man just told him. Why would an adult care about him and if he could see? Why would he help him? "I… but, sir… I don't think…""No, you don't, Mr. Potter. You don't think I would help you out of the kindness of my heart, and that is where you would be right. Thankfully, I am not a Hufflepuff, I am a Slytherin, and what I am doing is completely for my own self-interest. You see my class is a dangerous one, and I cannot have some arrogant pompous child thinking he can work around in my lab while unable to see and endangering his and everyone else's lives."Harry shook his head. He really didn't want that to happen, and by the man's tone, that would be the end of their kind relationship. Harry yanked the glasses from his face and nearly threw them at the man. He couldn't dare to think he hurt anyone or make the professor hate him. He didn't believe that was the only reason the man was helping him, but the man had a point.The man used his wand to cast spells over the glasses and toward Harry's eyes. That one kind of stung due to the light shining in them, but he wasn't one to complain. Finally, the man seemed to be finished and handed Harry back his glasses. He took the meekly and slowly put them onto his face, expecting them to maybe bite or in some way hurt him after having spells he didn't know put on them.They settled on his face, and he was pleasantly surprised and filled with wonder at the world he could now see. His professor had a large nose was his first thought, but he didn't mind. The man's nose looked good on his sharp featured face. Harry's jaw went slack though when he finally took in the rest of the room. There were things, stirring rods, and they were stirring on their own. There were so many things he didn't know were there before and so many details he could now see, even his own hands seemed foreign to him.His head felt fuzzy as he took in more details than he knew existed. A giggle built up in his throat, spilling forth when he could see the small smile on Professor Snape's face. "Sir, I can see."The man nodded slightly. "So you can. I expect a certain level of work ethic and completeness from you now that I am sure you can correctly see what is in front of you, and in my class, I will not allow you any slack. I have not done so with anyone to this day, and I will never do so with you."Harry sobered and nodded his head avidly. He would be the best wizard to ever potion a potion or was it make or whatever it was he would do it perfectly, just to please his professor. If Percy was right, he would try to be the best at defense too since the Professor was supposed to like it too. That way Professor Snape would still be kind to him.Harry watched the man walk to the front of the room and write on something. He waited on his stool since he assumed the man would have dismissed him if they were finished talking. He envied the way the man wrote with the quill. He knew he would have trouble with it when he finally had to write with one, but he hoped someone would teach him how before he had to turn in an essay. The professor walked back over to him and handed him a scrap of parchment. Harry's face scrunched in confusion before looking down at the clear words. The ability to see distracted him from actually reading what the note said."As you can see," the Professor broke in with a slight smirk, "the note dismisses you from the amount of class you have missed so far. It says that the reason was to discuss a detention, and I would rather you say it was for that reason as well if anyone questions you."Harry's face fell. It had seemed for a second like his professor was looking out for him and liked him, but really the man didn't think him special at all. He wanted people to think that he didn't like him and that he had been a bad boy already. Well, he'd say that was what happened if that was what the professor wanted, and maybe that would pay the man back from being so kind to him.The man placed a hand on his shoulder, and even though the movement was just as slow and deliberate as usual, Harry still flinched away. Harry could see out of the corner of his eye that the man's face was filled with confusion and concern, but Harry obviously needed to stop thinking of that as the man caring. He was just being a dumb little kid looking for someone to like him. "Harry, what's wrong?"He looked down, avoiding eye contact the professor was trying to make. "Nothing, sir."The man scoffed and grabbed his chin gently, bringing his face upward. He looked stern and concerned, and Harry's face dropped along with the tears from his eyes. Why was he such a baby? It was just one teacher. He could find another. He didn't even need one to be nice and to like him. He had lasted ten years without anyone doing that. He really didn't need anyone. Really."Mr. Potter, I think you are bothered by my telling you to lie, and I have never made it a habit of explaining myself to anyone, certainly not to children, but in this case, you will be my exception."Harry perked up at that. He was the exception for the professor to do something he hated. He was an exception. That meant something. It had to mean something.Snape

Hey people who are reading this, I am unsure if you are reading this but listen closely, the person sending offensive things about my being transgender and my transitioning and also on my child abuse, would you like to grow the balls you think you should have had and put down your email you chicken shit motherfucker because believe me, I am not as cowardly as you. Also if you want people to see what a big bad man you are, make an account and post the reviews. I will even leave them up. That is all for that person. For the rest of you, thanks for your reviews and I will work on your requests.Chapter FourHaving heard the boy's thoughts, Severus felt his heart he knew to be long missing aching in his chest; however, even with these knew feelings, he was glad he had caught that insecurity so soon. Harry being his exception did mean something, but Severus was unable and unmotivated to analyze this new part of his perception. What he could manage was to see that Harry was so pure even with all that he had been through and that was not a small feet. His thoughts on preserving Severus's interests even when he believed him not to 'like' him was very admirable.The boy was so good, and Slytherin, as loyalty without merit wasn't his way. He was loyal to those who gave him what he wanted or needed. That loyalty was also not as fickle as a Gryffindors. The boy was such a conundrum."Harry, the reason I wanted you to give out that excuse was that the reputation I have cultivated at this school does not match were people to know I was being kind to a child who happens to also be a Gryffindor. You see, Harry, I have a reputation as being unkind and also to favor my own house, the Slytherins, who just so happen to have a rivalry with Gryffindor. I would like that image to be the consensus of the rest of the school, although, you and I will know different. Do you follow?"The boy nodded, seeming to understand, but the problem, Severus believed, was that children had so many questions. "But, why, Sir?"Severus played ignorant, "Why what, Harry?""Why treat me special? Is it because I'm famous here? If so, I think I rather you didn't. And, also why do you want people to think you're mean?"Severus felt himself do an uncommon display of immaturity as his mental hand face-palmed. The child was intelligent and brave for him to speak that way, and in his own way, he was a cunning boy. He wanted to be treated special by Severus, but he wanted to achieve this by his own merit. He was so pure it physically pained Severus."Harry, the reason I treat you differently is you are special, but not because of that scar that most people will see as a reason to fawn over you. I have treated you with care because you are kind, intelligent, brave, and loyal. You are also a lot like someone I knew as a child, someone very special to me, and also like myself in some ways. Why I want my reputation is a matter I do not believe you could understand until you are older, and the matter is quite personal. However, I will tell you I am not proud of my reputation, neither how it makes me act nor why I must. It is my responsibility, so I must continue. Do you believe you can understand that, Harry?"The child looked thoughtful but nodded all the same, already showing Severus such trust it was confounding. He could not understand how the boy could be so innocent and so kind after the things he had seen. Severus had never been like that, and that was why they were so different and why Harry was so special. "Very well, Harry. I think it time you headed to class. Are you aware where it is?"The boy shook his head. "No, Sir."Severus sighed beneath his breath before standing. He did not need the child thinking he was bothersome. "Well, come along then we will go together. Though, for your next class, I believe you should take your schedule back from Mr. Weasley."The boy nodded as he stood. He looked around with a look of confusion before focusing back on Severus. "Where is my bag, Sir?"Severus snapped his fingers, and the bag came in from his office. The boy looked so impressed and questions were exploding from his mind. Severus decided to answer them before they were spat in quick succession. "Yes, you will learn that, not this year, and I performed wandless and wordless magic. Yes, you will learn that, but not for a long time. Now, may we go?"The boy still looked flummoxed as he nodded. Severus, seeing his chance to take advantage of being near such an impressionable child, snapped his robes in a flourish as he strode to the door to the lab. The boy followed, and a quick glance showed his awed face and another longer look showed him moving his arms to try for the same effect. He was ineffective, but Severus was having a good internal laugh at his efforts.They made their way, the boy looking around his jaw never closing completely as he took in the stone walls, the portraits, the moving staircases in wonderment. A warmth Severus usually denied existed burst from his chest at the look on the child's face. Severus would allow the boy to look like a dunderhead for now while he was in his company, but the child could not look so unguarded all the time around those that were against him.That would be something to teach him. Maybe he could mentor the boy. That would be enough to watch and mold the boy. He could see the boy any day then and protect him from those who would harm him. What was he doing thinking about this? He just met the child. The boy probably barely liked him and probably only when he was kind, not when he would have to teach and discipline him. It could never work, and why was that such a sad thought that he felt a need for a change. No, thoughts for later contemplation after the little blighter was away.He nodded to himself and stopped abruptly seeing as they had arrived at the Charms classroom. He snapped open the door and watched with satisfaction as Professor Flitwick fell backwards off his shelf of literature. He rolled his eyes internally at the man's antics as he grabbed Harry by the shoulder and falsely forced him through the door. He ignored the boy's flinch as he looked to the small professor. "A straggler for you, Flitwick. It seems Mr. Potter was lost. You will have to excuse the time, I had to discuss time and maps before giving him the time for his detention tonight."The demur professor frowned at him but nodded. "Very well, Severus. Mr. Potter, please be seated."Severus felt his mind soften as the boy turned to look back at him and gave a small smile before trotting to a seat by the red-headed boy. Severus glared once around the room before strolling out with his usual theatrics. He hoped tonight would go well or as well as discussing neglect and abuse can; however, he was already preparing to need dreamless sleep tonight.HarryHarry couldn't eat. Well, he was sure that he could try to eat, but his stomach was all floaty and sick was building as he thought on why the professor would want to talk about this? He didn't want the man to find out what a freak he was, and he knew he wasn't supposed to talk about what his Uncle and Aunt did to him. It had always been like this. He was to stay quiet and to know he was a freak. Why?He was startled from his internal thoughts by food floating to his plate. He already knew it was from the professor, and he almost ignored the burning in his ears telling him the man was glaring at him. He couldn't withhold longer and looked at the man in trepidation. The professor gave him a stern look and no words were necessary. Why was that look so effective? Sheesh!He ate all the food that surprisingly didn't make him sick with just enough time to get up with Ron and make his way toward the dungeon's labs. His palms were sweating, and his hands were fluttering nervously at his sides. Ron gave him looks of concern and patted his shoulder a lot to try and calm him while it mostly just made him jump or jerk away. Finally, they made it to the same office as earlier and knocked twice on the broad door.The professor opened the door and scowled at them, though he really only looked directly at Ron. The man stepped aside and gestured them into the office, where Malfoy was already waiting in one of the chairs facing the desk. The door slammed shut behind him, and Harry could admit he jumped about two feet off the floor. He wasn't scared, not of the professor. He was kind, and Harry was an exception. He could almost convince himself that was true.The man walked behind his desk, not sitting but making himself tower over the other two boys. "Today, Mr. Weasley, Mr. Malfoy, you two will both write essays on why pointing a wand at another is unwise at school when you both are untrained and know hardly any spells, and you will continue on with why it is unwise except in self-defense. You will write three feet, and I will read them over. Do you both understand?"The blonde and red-head nodded with white faces. "Yes, sir.""Very well. You may go into the lab to work, but make no mistake, I am watching you. Act up, and the both of you will be in detention with me every Saturday until Christmas."The two gulped before gathering their things. Ron hesitated, looking to Harry questioningly, but Harry waved him off, allowing the two boys to leave together for the lab. Harry turned his body toward the professor, keeping his eyes drawn downwards. The professor made a tutting sound, causing Harry to catch the man bringing out his wand. Harry's fear and slight curiosity was snuffed out as the man spelled two comfy chairs and a tea service where his visitor chairs had been. Harry smiled slightly at the treatment, knowing it was because he was an exception, special."Have a seat, Harry."Harry nodded, picking the blue chair and leaving the green for the professor. The man poured their tea and handed Harry a saucer and cup. His hands shook so much from nerves that he wasn't sure he should have a cup at all. The man must have noticed because he sent a spell at the cup, and when Harry jumped in surprise, he saw the effect as not a drop spilled. The man's wand was used a few more times on all the doors before he put it away in his sleeve. Harry thought that a mighty odd place for a wand, but he wouldn't say that to the professor.The man settled into his chair with black tea and a blank face. "Are you ready to begin?"Harry was shaking as he nodded his head. The man looked concerned but was leaving him alone. "Would it be easier if I asked all the questions?"Harry nodded again, hovering over his cup, failing to meet the man's eyes. "Would you mind if I recorded this?"Harry gulped and contemplated it, but there wasn't enough information to make the decision because why would he want anyone else have to ever hear this? "For what reason would you, Professor?"The man looked at him like he had gone around the bend. "Harry, if the situation is as bad as I fear, then it will be for the authorities. You will not be going back if you are being harmed, Harry. I will not allow it."That just confused Harry even more. "But, why? Because my scar? Because I'm a-an… exception." Harry ducked his head at this one before continuing. "Why does this matter to you, sir?"The professor rested a hand on his leg, and Harry peered at him through his fringe. "It is very simple, Mr. Potter. No one deserves to have a childhood without love, shelter, clothes, or food. If anyone else had been through the same treatment, I would endeavor to help them as well. No one deserves to be treated that way, Harry."It was meant to be kind, but Harry was stupid enough to think he could be special. He did think more of the professor for being so kind to help people, which shouldn't make him feel so disappointed. Harry looked up to see the man still looking at him sincerely and saw something odd in how emotional the man's eyes were. "Sir, the r-reason y-you are so, uhm…"Harry was saved as the man interrupted him. "Yes, Harry, I understand what you are trying to say. I am only telling you this because I believe it will help you trust me and to feel less alone in your predicament. My parents neglected me. My mother because she was sick and would be hurt at my father's hand more often than not. My father was a drunk, and he would yell and hit us when in a rage and then drink all of our money away. Neither tried to help me nor be there for me, and I went without more often than not. My mother died my second year at Hogwarts, and I was left taking the full force of my father's anger until I graduated. When he would hurt me, it was only smacks and shoves, but it was enough. No one helped me, but I do not want you to deal with the same."Harry couldn't stand it after hearing all the man had gone through and threw himself at the man to hug him. The man luckily caught him, but Harry didn't care, he just crushed himself against the man to send all the comfort and apologies he could barely say because he was crying for the man. He didn't understand how people could hurt kids, especially ones that were their own kids. At least the Dursley's weren't his parents."I am so sorry, Sir."The man rubbed a hand up and down his back soothingly as he spoke. "Thank you, Harry. I too, am sorry for you, but I still need to hear you say it before I can help you. Now that I have told you what I went through, I hope you can be brave enough to do it as well. Do you think you can do that, Harry?"Harry pulled away from the man and sat back down all while taking deep breaths to calm down. "I can be brave, Professor.""Good, now let's begin."Snape

Chapter FiveSnape had been occluding since they began. He had no choice if he were to remain without a murderous look while the boy spoke of endless years of chores and unfair punishments that bordered well past abuse and into demented torture when the whale of an uncle was drunk. He was clenching his fists to keep himself from moving toward the boy to comfort him, but there was no reason. The boy never got upset, never complained that his treatment from the family was unfair because Severus could tell that to him, it was normal.The boy never cried, never whined, never said it was unfair, not a single complaint was heard and it almost seemed like the child was just talking about his day at school. The most he ever did was defend their actions with things they had obviously drilled into him, calling himself a freak, saying the cousin deserved better because he was their son, and trying to make Severus see how this was what he deserved.The whale had trained the boy well to believe that everything he had done to the boy was deserved. The whale of an uncle liked to smack, shove, and grab him by the hair; the Aunt, Petunia, liked to swing a frying pan at him, show the cousin love while Harry watched, and starved the boy without thought sometimes for days as punishment; and the cousin was taught to bully the boy into a lonelier existence without even school friends and breaking his arm and other bones when upset. The aunt and uncle made him sleep in a cupboard, would leave him with Mrs. Figg while they went on vacations, and never bought the boy anything not second-hand.The boy was neglected, verbally and physically abused, and severely malnourished. Severus would not allow him to stay there even one more hour, and this wasn't even the worst case he had seen, unless he excluded magically abused children because then it was the worst muggle case. He would have to contact Lucius to get the boy removed from their care without leaking it past the child protective division of the ministry. He would also have to find the boy a suitable home with people who could handle all that came with being a guardian to an abused Harry Potter.The boy would need individual attention and understanding, which he could not find at the Weasley Household; therefore, they were the first off the list. Dark families needed no explanation for being crossed off, and some others he was skeptical could handle this kind of responsibility. The prospects dwindled the more he thought, and even worse would be getting the boy's opinion. He would have to halt the mental decision for another time.He knew he would have to wait for the guardianship to be finalized before telling the Headmaster. The man had controlled the boy's life for too long, and Severus would not be able to stop himself from hurting the codger if he were to get in his way of protecting the boy. First, before he got ahead of himself, he had a vulnerable, young Potter in front of him that may need medical attention, that definitely needed nutrient potions, and also could use all the kindness Severus could spare in his minimal faculties.Severus knew the boy to be very emotionally observant, and watching the boy now glancing from his face to the boy's knees, he could see the child looking for his reaction. The most Severus had done was clench his hands, knowing anymore anger or emotion of any kind may scare the skittish boy silent. He turned his whole body to face the boy and leaned forward with his elbows on his knees, bringing him nearly level with the bent head of messy hair. "Harry."He received a flinch, and immediately stopped moving to make sure the boy wouldn't react more unfavorably. "Harry, I would like to discuss with you what actions I am about to take so you are aware ahead of time."The boy's face looked so guarded. "You believe me?"The incredulousness in his voice caused Severus to reach a slow hand out and pat the boy's knee. "Of course I believe you, Harry. There is no reason for you to lie, and it was I who brought this up to discuss, not you. You even tried to deny it until the very end while there is every shred of evidence that they have abused you. I will never not believe you, Harry. You have proven yourself already to be a kind and trustworthy boy. Now, what I am going to do is have a very powerful friend of mine," Lucius was much more than a friend, but Harry had no need of knowing something so personal, "and he will get the two of us a meeting, secured for your privacy, with the ministry's child services. They will inquire, of course, who you want for a guardian eventually after they have proven your current guardians unfit. Between now and when we get to that part of the process, we together will look for a suitable guardian. And that is the extent of what will happen, and no one will know what is happening behind the scenes unless you want them inside of this investigation."The boy looked even more skittish now than he had before, and Severus felt confused internally when he was sure he had allayed the child's fears. "What problem do you have with this plan, Harry? I want to help, but you have to tell me."The boy nodded while his body shook with fear. "What if no one wants me, sir? I-I can't go to an orphanage, please, my uncle told me what happens there."Severus grabbed the boy's shoulders before he could babble more. The boy cut himself off with a squeak and flinched slightly away from the man. Severus held strong to the boy's bony shoulders, showing him not all touches were bad and none of those Severus dealt out would ever hurt him. "That will not happen while I am around, Harry."Severus saw the boy shaking his head, tears breaking through his eyes and running down reddening cheeks. "No, Harry, I am giving my word to you, and I always keep my word. I promise to you, you will have somewhere, and your guardian will be kind and will love you as you deserve. If you do not like anyone or cannot find anyone safe enough, I will take your guardianship myself while we find a suitable replacement. I promise to protect you, just as you have always deserved."The boy's tears did not abate, but when the little blighter buried himself against Severus, he counted the conversation as a success if an uncomfortable one. "Thank y-you, s-sir, no… ever… want… me," the boy gasped out between shaky breaths.Severus frowned at that and rubbed the boy's back, wishing it wasn't illegal to poison muggles. He shook off the thought and looked down at the small, eleven year old. "You were wanted, Harry. Your parents wanted you and loved you so much they protected you until death. I… I can't give that yet, but I do want to help you, Harry. You're my exception."The boy perked up at him, his glasses askew and his hair mussed and framing his red face like he'd woken from a rough sleep. He looked so young-is so young. "You would want me?"Severus nodded with his stoney expression, making it a serious statement, not at all heartfelt and emotional. "Of course, I would, Harry. You are a good child, one I would not mind having around. But, I highly doubt you would want me around for that long. I am a very bitter, mean man. I would never hurt you, but I would not be too fun to be around nor a great comfort."The boy shook his head. "It's not about that with parents, Professor. Parents have to be good at talking with you, protecting you, disciplining you, providing for you, and guiding you. I've seen so many people with their parents and know what makes it fun. The fun is spending time with someone who cares about you, well for me, that's what I thought it looked like."Severus had never thought about it like that, but he had also never had parents to demonstrate it. The boy had a point that he could not deny, and Severus could follow those parameters. He could be…'You are getting ahead of yourself, Snape! Wait, watch, and think before doing that to a vulnerable child.'He could be that, yes, but it was too soon. He was too cold and serious, and he could barely manage to allow physical contact with the boy. They would work it out, but better to take it one step at a time. He nodded to the boy. "I can see that now, thank you, Harry, and now, I think that it is late."The boy nodded, rubbing his eyes longer than it took to clear tears. "Yessir. Is Ron coming too? Don't wanna walk alone."Severus looked at the tired boy softly before shaking his head. "He has one more hour, Harry. Would you like me to walk you up to the tower?"The boy blushed and shrugged. "You don't need to, sir. I can go alone, or I could wait here."The boy was falling asleep almost. Severus knew the boy needed to go back now, so he used a stern look and angled his head toward the door. "Come along, you're too tired to wait here."The boy sluggishly got up, covering a small yawn as he went by Severus and out the office door. "Sorry, Professor, I'm just really tired."Severus frowned in concern and looked over the boy's black eyes. "Did you not sleep well?"Severus watched the boy's neck flush. "The bed… it didn't… 's weird."Severus nodded his understanding after having heard about the boy's life. He could see how the boy would feel that way and contemplated how to ease his discomfort. He knew one way, but he was sure he was being an emotional Hufflepuff just contemplating that the only way to ease the boy would be to tuck him in tight. It really would make the space feel tighter for a boy so used to sleeping confined by walls of a cupboard.Severus was resolved in what he had to do when they reached the portrait hole. He disillusioned himself, causing the sleepy boy to jolt. "Professor? Are you there?"Severus smirked, but unlike his usual predisposition to unnerve children, he could not get up the deviousness to scare the boy. Who was he and what had he done with the real Severus Snape?"Yes, Harry. I am still present, just disillusioned from sight. I have a solution to your sleeping problems. I need to go in with you, but I rather not have anyone see me."The boy bit his lip looking undecided. "What kinda somethin', sir?"Severus felt slightly impressed at the boy's unease. He could be distrusting and cautious. That was good. The boy need not be so trusting all the time, not without Severus earning it first. "Just a way to make the bed feel tighter around you. Nothing more, Harry."The boy nodded and turned to the Fat Lady who was eyeing Severus with an evil eye. "No snakes allowed, Little Lion," she said to Harry.Harry frowned and Severus watched amused as he pouted up at her. "He's helping me sleep, ma'am. Please."The lady frowned and looked to Severus. Severus rolled his eyes. "I am a teacher, madame. I am allowed through, and I do need to help him to sleep, and you are hindering him from getting to his bed. So make hast. Caput Draconis."She scowled at him but opened her portrait to them. Severus put a hand on Harry's shoulder and subtly led the boy through the opening into the common room. Children were all over in chairs, on the floor, hanging off the stair banister. Severus wanted so badly to correct their behavior. No snake would act as they were and neither would Harry. He looked down to see the boy's wide eyes and shaking figure. He would never have to worry about the boy doing this, but it seemed he would have to worry more about getting him comfortable enough to do anything at all.Severus sighed to himself, 'Children.'He pushed the boy slightly, steering him toward the boy's staircase and to the first year dormitory. Harry opened the door, and Severus was met with the sight of a messy eleven year old room. No one was in there, so Severus swept past the doorway and shut it where he was alone with a sheepish looking Harry.Severus took off the charm and stood there with his eyes sweeping around the room with disdain. No one in his house would have dared to have their room like this. He made sure of it. "I-I'm sorry, sir. I didn't know it was so messy. I-I'll clean it up."Severus wiped the annoyance from his face, turning to watch the boy fidget from foot to foot with nerves. Severus arched a brow. "Which one of these pig styes is yours, Harry?"If Severus's instincts were correct, which they usually were, it would be the one to little to no belongings and was clean and made up. The boy pointed to that very bed, and Severus nodded. 'Right again.'"I had thought so, Harry. You will not touch anyone else's mess. Do I make myself clear?" The boy nodded his face puzzled and his nervous hands untwining. "You are only responsible for cleaning after yourself, Harry. They will clean their own. You are not a servant, and they need to learn how to pick up after themselves on their own."The boy looked like Severus had done a jig, but he nodded just the same. "I understand, sir, I won't."Snape nodded. "Very good. Now get ready for bed, I will wait here."Severus conjured a chair and set it facing away from the boy for his privacy. He heard the scurrying and the fast unclothing and clothing. He'd tell the boy to slow down, but he was happy to get out of the door as soon as possible. The boy cleared his throat, and Severus turned to see him with some degree of anger at the state of the boy's bedclothes, which looked fit for a large fifth year boy, not an eleven year old.Severus sighed. So much to do and remedy for this child. "Up onto the bed then, Harry," he called as he walked up to the boy's bed. The boy got up scantily able to reach. The beds were too big for the shorter younger boys, and no one thought to have them grow with the children. Severus cast a spell, making all the beds lower a bit as to not have Harry feeling singled out.The boy noticed the change and gaped at him. Severus just rolled his eyes as he stepped up to the bed. "Ready?"The boy nodded, his lip being shredded again by his teeth. Severus would love to remedy that habit also, but not tonight. He took the boy's sheets and bought them high up to his chest before tucking in the sides tightly. The boy's face turned from nervous to outright shocked. A peek into the boy's mind showed he'd never been 'Tucked in.' Well, Severus was not doing that. He was creating a tight space for the boy to sleep. 'Yes, sure, that's it.'He rolled his eyes at the boy, but kept tucking until the boy had to feel squished in, but the child's face looked much more at ease once he finished, "Does that feel more comfortable for you?"The boy nodded, mumbling some things that could be thank yous, already half asleep. Severus rolled his eyes, closing the curtains around the bed and turning to stalk off. He put back on his charms and went to striding quickly away from the hideous lion's den and back to his two miscreants.They had to have about thirty minutes or less left on their detention for being a couple of wand waving fools. Draco, his godson, would learn nothing from this. He would take no lessons from Severus after what had happened this summer. His parents were divorced and had been since the boy was nine, but up until this summer, Narcissa had lived at the manor. She, having wanted to move in with her new beau, had moved out, and Severus had moved in with the two blonde Malfoys.Draco had correctly deducted Severus and Lucius were now together, and incorrectly thought that to be the reason his mother moved out. Now, Severus was not the boy's favorite person in the world, and Severus could not say this new attitude the boy had made him any more dear to Severus. He would just have to keep trying, for Lucius's sake.He made it back to the classroom, where the two were writing an essay on the foolishness of pulling their wands when neither knew a single spell yet. He hoped that made its way into at least one child's essay. The red-head looked up as he walked in while the blonde kept his head bowed, purposefully ignoring his gaze. He looked to see how far along they were, and he saw the Weasley boy had gotten at least a foot in while it seemed his godson had not deigned to write a word. Severus growled and swooped over to hover menacingly over his godson. "Mr. Malfoy, what do you mean by this blank piece of parchment?"The boy gazed up haughtily at him. "I think we both know what I mean, Severus."Snape felt his blood run hotly through him at the boy's cheek. "Weasley!"He did not turn to see the boy, but he knew he had jumped in his seat judging by the clatter it produced. "Yes, Professor," the child squeaked."Leave us! Your detention is over and your work adequate. Defy me, Weasley, and the next detention will leave your fingers bleeding."The boy scurried from the room shouting, "Yes, sir!"Severus had not lifted his glare from the blonde, but he allowed it to move over to the fireplace in his office. He hoped for the boy's sake that he would remain where he was. He flooed the Malfoy residence waiting for Lucius to answer. It took one more second of shouting for the man to come running into the sitting room. "Lucius! Get here, now! I am going to strangle your offspring!"The man snorted but came through the floo as soon as Severus moved from the grate. The blonde looked as well-groomed as usual and was wearing dark navy robes. Severus rolled his eyes. "Dressed like that at this hour, Lucius? Honestly?"The blonde smirked. "Jealous, Severus?"Severus scoffed, glaring hotly. "Hardly, Lucius."The blonde got in closer to him, causing Severus to narrow his eyes at the man. "I was just about to call my male suitor; however, it seems he called me."Severus rolled his eyes. "For good reason. That blonde delinquent was in detention for pulling a wand on another student after bullying another, which will be why he serves the next few weeks of detention. I set them to writing an essay and came back to it not written and to the boy giving me an attitude. Fix your child before I ring his skinny little neck."The man looked less than amused after he had told him what the boy had done, and Severus stormed into the classroom with Lucius following him. Draco was smirking when Severus first stepped into the room, but once Lucius followed him in, the flocking peacock deflated before him looking like the scared first year he was. Severus felt sick satisfaction at his fear."Draco, remain in your seat. As you can see, your father has come by, and I thought it to be an even better detention for you if he were to try and penetrate that stubborn blonde head of yours. As I know why it will be a waste of my voice to try, Lucius has gladly decided to take over your scolding."The blonde corrected his slack jaw, by setting it in anger. Severus smirked, settling himself onto the front of his desk. He wanted a good seat for the show. "Draconis Lucius Malfoy! Pulling a wand on another student, bullying, and then having shown a lack of respect for your Professor, you really are wanting a punishment. What were you thinking?"The boy stumbled with his words before looking down. "It was Potter, Father."Lucius looked back at Severus, but Severus just rolled his eyes with a shrug. Lucius turned back on the boy, towering over him. "That makes no difference, Draco. You do not bully people. It will not make you a better man or wizard, and it is beneath you. Do I make myself clear?"The boy nodded. "A verbal response, Mr. Malfoy," Severus sneered."Yes, sir," the boy spit with a glare."About that attitude you have with Severus, Draco, that is ending right this instant. Your mother left to be with her boyfriend, not because of Severus."The boy scoffed. "Poofs," the boy said under his breath.Severus almost jumped as Lucius smacked his son across the face. Severus was on his feet in the next second, grabbing Lucius and dragging him away from the boy. Lucius shouted, "Don't you dare disrespect me you, wretched whelp! I made you, boy!"Severus understood it was hard to be called that by someone you loved, but he would not allow another child to be hurt in his presence. "Lucius, stop! Go home! I will take care of this!"The man growled, but he nodded his head and left the way he had come. Severus went over to the shaking boy sitting in the same desk as he had been while his head was ducked. "Draco, I apologize for Lucius's actions. I am sure he will as well once he calms down. What he was getting at was also what you just did. We would like you to stop disrespecting us, and maybe somehow we can come to an understanding."The blonde boy looked up at him with anger in his eyes. "I'm going to live with my mother before one of you poofs buggers me. Sod off, Snape."The boy spat at his feet before running out of the room. Severus had occluded as soon as the slurs were thrown, and it was lucky he had. He would have hit the boy as well. The disrespectful sod never appreciated anything they did or gave him. He was the biggest git Severus knew, and it was entirely Lucius and Nacrissa's fault.He finally stood from his seat and incendio'ed the parchment where the boy had failed to write his discrepancies. He glared at the spot and sent a charm to clean it of the ash and black. He stormed to the floo and whisked himself away to Malfoy Manor. "Lucius," he called as he made it into the entrance hall.He heard crashing and the sound of spells rebounding, which made him correctly deduct that the man was in his dueling room. He went to see the man exploding dummies and burning half the room in his anger. Severus sighed and settled himself into a chair to wait the man out. Lucius sent one last dummy into extinction with a bombarda before turning to where Severus sat."What did that little… where is he?" Lucius bit out.Severus sighed. "He stormed off. Says he is living with Narcissa. You might warn her."Lucius nodded before coming over to him. "What did he mean about Harry Potter being the one he was bullying? Shouldn't a Gryffindor be more brave, more brash?"Severus sighed harder this time. "This will be a longer conversation than I am prepared to give. I still have to go over it myself. I'm not ready to speak of it, just know Draco caused the boy to bust his nose and degraded the boy.""Yes, he seems to be very good at using words to degrade people. He continued once you left, but I highly doubt I can get through to him."Lucius growled and whipped his wand, sending a laceration spell at a well placed dummy. Severus understood it was painful for family to hurt you in this way as his father and mother had been the same with him. He rested a comforting hand on the man's shoulder and pressed his lips to the top of the man's head. "I must leave, Lucius. I am not supposed to leave the school, but I invite you to come to my rooms if need be."His partner nodded before turning to kiss him full on the lips. Severus smirked against the lips before kissing him back. He winked before sweeping away from the man and heading back to his rooms by floo. He settled himself into his favourite armchair and allowed himself to drop his masks fully.He looked to the heavens expecting Lily to be there looking down on all this. His sister in everything but blood, his closest confidant, and the mother to the boy he was now trying to save. He knew too much about the boy now from his poor childhood to his poor habits caused from that abuse.He did not know how to use cutlery. He expected to be given nothing and thought of himself as a freak. He did not cry from pain like most eleven year olds and could speak of his abuse with no emotion. The boy was shaky and nervous, and his body often made itself hunched and smaller. He flinched on reflex from any loud noises or movements and angled away from touch but could not stop from pushing toward comfort.He had seen all of this in both his talk with the child and at the meals, where he had kept his eyes on the boy. He had sent food to the boy, but knowing what he knew about the child, it would be hard for him to get much of the food down as malnourished as he was. He had seen how malnourished he was, he had seen the screaming large man in his head, and all of it made Severus feel things he had thought only Lucius brought out of him.He wanted to protect the child. He wanted to help him. And though emotion and comfort were not his strongest skills, he would be there for the child. He was going to help him get out from under the Dursley's guardianship. He was going to help him find new guardians, who would be there for the child. He was going to do everything in his power to make it up to his sister.He rubbed his weary eyes. "I am sorry, Lily," he said to the ceiling. "I should have been there for Harry, and I should have been there for you. Albus sent your boy to your sister. She tortured the boy as did her husband and son. I am sure you have no love left for your nephew, so I will be frank when I say he is a whale of a boy with a brutish physicality aimed at your son. They hurt him, Lily, and I am so sorry. I should have been there, and then today, I was too late to stop him from getting hurt. Lucius, as you should know, is my partner. His son Draco is not very respectful and is an ingrate. He is the one that hurt your boy, and well, I tried to punish him, but it seems everything I do is a mistake, Lily."He sighed at himself, talking to her like this. She was long dead, and still he missed her. He missed his friend, his sister, and he felt the weight of both that and the undeniable disappointment she must feel at how he has been proceeding with his life.He got to his feet and went to his personal bar. He was not his father, but he would not lie and say he did not enjoy a nightcap every now and then. It would be more than that tonight. It needed to be to calm the moving thoughts and ideas in his head. He poured three fingers of scotch and lifted his glass to Lily. "What's one more, Lily?"He downed the drink in one go before setting his glass back to the bar. He didn't feel it as of yet, and he expected he would need more to feel anything. He poured another and downed it before having another on standby as he went to his seat.He looked back to the sky as a good buzz filtered into his thoughts. "I know this isn't what you meant for me, Lily. I want to do better, and I will. For you. The boy needs my help, and I want to be there for him. Hopefully, I can find someone who loves him to take him."He downed the third glass and stood up to go to bed. There was no reason to stay awake worrying over things. He would also not be able to make any better preparations in the state he was in now. He changed into his bedclothes and moved to his bed. He would have to settle more of these variables in the next few days and get the process for Harry's new guardianship rolling. He let those last thoughts leave him as he fell asleep.

The world of Harry Potter is not mind and I included portions of Book 1 in this chapter because I love Severus's speech and could not let it be discarded. Hope this pleases everyone, because I am really liking this chapter.Chapter SixHarry didn't know why he was there of all places, there waiting outside the Professor Snape's office with his nose chilled from standing in the Dungeons for too long. He was supposed to be heading to breakfast in an hour and the Professor would be too, but there was something wrong, and he didn't know who else to tell. He didn't really know anyone else here besides Ron and the Hermione girl from the train, and they would both be kinda useless at this too. He needed to speak with the Professor.He sighed, running a hand through his messy hair and then trying to flatten the straying back from sticking up. What was he thinking, trusting someone with more after already letting go of so many of his secrets? Was he going barmy, why was he all of the sudden feeling so obligated to share his problems with the man? He had tried waiting for three days now, but he just couldn't stop thinking of how helpful the man had been, how comforting, and how safe. Why was he doing this?"Stupid," he hissed.It was then the door swung inward and a blur of black robes strode out right into Harry, who fell to the ground with a small oomph as his hands scraped the surface of the stone corridor. He heard a curse from above, pulling his gaze to look up at the dour man. He felt off-kilter and wary to hurt as he saw the man looking down at him from higher than usual, his towering height casting even more of a shadow on him. He shook in his place on the ground before seeing the man's try at a smile and a reached out hand.Harry's mind and his heart slowed down as the factors and actions came together to a completely different pattern than at the Dursleys, leaving him staring at the hand in front of him. The man snapped his fingers, and Harry took the proffered hand that pulled him so quickly he let out a surprised yelp, much to his own embarrassment.He caught the Professor looking smugly at him, and Harry flushed to his toes. "Um… Sorry... Sir, I wasn't… I mean," he intertwined his hands behind his back and bowed his head to look at the floor. "I'm sorry, Professor. That was my fault."The man's whole body turned to him in a curious tilt, pulling Harry to peak up at his face, and he was met with an arched brow. "It is of no consequence, Potter." Harry's mouth floundered. What had happened to Harry? "No harm came to yourself, correct?"Harry nodded, and the man made a relieved nod back. "Very well, what brought you so early down to my office on this fine Wednesday morning, Mr. Potter?"Harry flushed and looked down at his torn sneakers he had put on by mistake this morning. He scuffed the toe against the stone floor and used the other to toe at the holes in the stitching. He wanted to have help from the Professor, but he was losing his bravery as he stood there. He hoped he wasn't being a baby bringing it to the man, because he really never wanted to waste the man's time.He untwined his hands when the Professor tapped them lightly with his own hand, and that one action reminded him how the man could be if only he let him. Harry looked up to see the stern gaze and nodded. He needed the man's help.Yesterday and the day before had been weird, and he needed help to get through the problems, and he had only met one nice adult to turn to so far, and that was the Professor. Best to start with the small problem, and see if the Professor would help with that at least. He turned his head to fully make eye contact with the man and smiled weakly. "I dunno how to use quills, sir."The man smirked slightly and angled his head so that Harry knew to step inside behind the man. The comfy chairs from two days ago were brought back with a wave of the Professor's hand, and Harry took his blue chair and picked up tea again. It seemed like a routine even after only one other previous meeting.The man also sat down and took his tea without sugar. Harry couldn't understand how and added scoops of sugar and cream to his before sipping it with a happy hum. The man tapped the table between them, and Harry looked up from the small happy dance he was doing in his seat. "Well, Harry, we will, of course, get to having some remedial lessons to cover that oversight, but what seems to be the real cause of why you didn't eat dinner last night? Because you see, I am certain you are not so fickle as to let something of such little magnitude as being unable to handle a quill stop you from eating, and most assuredly not when I had sent food to your plate."Harry winced having forgotten he had ignored the man yesterday. How did the man always know though? Harry had not said anything to anyone, but the Professor could almost read him like he was an open book. Harry's hands fluttered anxiously until he got a tap to them that made him aware he was doing it and even more aware that the Professor was trying to get him to stop. The man's gaze was stern, and Harry couldn't help but to feel bad for not listening to the man. But, honestly, he couldn't eat. He was so nervous and his head had hurt so much that he was sure he would sicked up all over himself and his only friend. He just had to get the man to understand."I… um, well, you see, my scar… it was all prickly, and it hurt all day, and I, well, I know it's dumb… it's just, it gave me such a headache, and I couldn't…" he filtered off as the man looked to be giving him a curious look.He felt a little more at ease to have gotten the story out to the man. The Professor nodded, leaning forward slightly and resting his palms on his thighs. The slow movements had Harry's nerves easing significantly. "Has this ever happened before that you can recall, Harry?"Harry nodded his head avidly. He would have remembered if this ever happened before Hogwarts, and now, it had happened three times in as many days. "Yes, sir, but not before coming to school here."The man frowned and scooted forward a tad more. "May I take a look at the scar on your forehead, Harry?"He nodded his acceptance, moving closer to meet the man half-way. The Professor took his face in warm, firm hands and seemed to gaze directly at the scar that still felt red and irritated. The man didn't poke or prod at it, which Harry was grateful for, but he did take out his wand and wave it over the mark with the wand tip lit. Soon enough, the man pulled away, putting his wand away as he did. Harry leaned back also, taking sips of tea to occupy his nervous hands. "So, Professor?"The man arched his eyebrow. "I cannot seem to find anything through the means I tried just now, but I see the scar to be irritated. Would you mind if I treated that for you, Harry?"Harry shook his head, and the man went to a cabinet by his desk and took out the same type of jar as he had on Monday. Essence of Murtlap was what the man had called it, which Harry knew from before would heal him. The man came back over to him and gently took some of the potion to his forehead, causing a cooling sensation to come over him. He sighed in relief, letting his tensed shoulders relax some.He looked up to see the Professor looking him over with concern. "How is your headache, Harry?"Harry smiled at the man. "Already gone, Professor! Thanks!"The man nodded minutely while putting away the jar. The man came back to his seat and leaned forward once more. Harry felt his body tense back up, but he wasn't as nervous as he had been last time he sat here. "Could you tell me when this happened to you, Harry?"Harry gulped, getting nervous as he knew what he had in answer to the man's question. He placed his cup down as his hands began to shake, and he wanted to fidget with them but stopped himself by sticking them under his thighs. He couldn't look back up at the man, so he glared at his knees. "Um, well, the first night, sir, and in every defense class since."Harry peeked up through his fringe to see the man's eyebrow raised and the stern frown was back. Harry felt his panic pick up and rushed to explain, "Uh, sir, t-the thing is, I thought it was you. I looked up and my scar hurt when I saw you at the Welcoming Feast. B-but, it hasn't happened around you since, and well, then it happened when I looked at Hagrid the next morning and then in defense the first day, which was when I got that really bad headache, but it stopped, but then the next defense class it hurt even worse when I was standing with the Professor while he demonstrated a spell, and it hurt so bad I thought I might sick up. I'm really sorry for being bad and not eating and disobeying, and I am just some useless.""Harry," the man snapped, stopping him from his rambling.Harry looked down sheepishly and blushed. The man tutted and lifted his gaze with a finger under his chin. Harry's embarrassment faded at the man's softened look. There wasn't a smile, but Harry could see it in the man's eyes, and it reassured him. "I am no longer disappointed over you not eating, and you are not bad; however, I am quite displeased you saw it fit not to mention this to me Monday."Harry looked down again, feeling his chest tighten with nerves. "I'm sorry, sir. I just forgot with us talking so much about… well, the other stuff. And, well, I didn't want to bother you."He looked away sheepishly, feeling vulnerable even mentioning their talk over his home-life. The Professor settled a hand on his knee, and Harry peeked up to see a reassuring look pasted on the man's usually frowning face. The comfort was automatic, and he lifted tear streaked cheeks to see the man fully. "It's something I can understand, Harry. After all, you were not up to speaking with me, and I am grateful you came so soon to get help."Harry's body flooded with warmth at the praise, and he stopped second-guessing telling the man his problems. The man had listened to him about the Dursleys. The Professor could help him. "Thank you, sir, but how do we, um, well, how do we fix it?"The man frowned, leaning back in his chair with his hands steepled to his lips. "I will discuss it with Madame Pomphrey, the matron here at the school, but until we know more, I would have you come to me when it is bothering you so that I may heal it as I did today."Harry looked at the man in awe. The man was inviting him to get his help multiple times a week, but wouldn't that bother the man? Wouldn't he become a burden, and then the Professor would stop helping him? Maybe he could nick some of the healing potion the man had, and then well, he would only bother the man if his headaches were really bad. "Um, yes, sir, I will."Harry bit his lip anxiously, thinking about how to get his hands on the potion without being caught. He scraped the bottom lip, trying to smooth it out in his nerves. He was stopped by a hand grabbing his chin and tapping his lip. He looked to see the man giving him a stern frown, and Harry ducked his head. "No more of that, Mr. Potter. You are hurting yourself needlessly, and if I find you hurting yourself again, it will be a detention."Harry froze for a moment with shock before shaking his head. "No, I won't… Honest, I'll stop. 'M sorry, Professor."The man nodded before leaning away from him with his arms and legs crossed. "We have one more matter to discuss before breakfast, Mr. Potter."Harry honestly hated being called Mr. Potter by his Professor. He hadn't really known his name until grade school, but being called Harry by an obviously cold and well-mannered Professor Snape had felt like winning something, and being back to Mr. Potter felt like a demotion. He would have to do better, to win the man over.Harry straightened in his chair, his hands going under his legs and his teeth clenching to keep from biting into his lip. "Yes, Professor?""I have been in conversation with the matron here, Madame Pomphrey, and she has been made aware I have a new student for her to examine."Harry knocked his foot into the table as he stood from his chair. "You told her!"He didn't want to be angry with the Professor, but the man had promised. "No, now, sit down, Harry, and watch your tone."Harry froze at the cold tone in the man's voice, but he sat without shaking too much. How could he let himself have an outburst like that. Who did he think he was? This was an adult, and he was a freak. "I'm sorry, sir."The man sighed, and Harry looked up in time to see the man rub at his temples. "It is fine. I apologize for snapping. As I was saying, I have spoken with her about having another student without naming you specifically so that I may have your blessing beforehand."Harry felt like the biggest prat in the school. "Oh."The man rolled his eyes. "Indeed. I made the appointment for tonight if you will agree to letting her in on our investigation."Harry flexed his fingers nervously. "But, why, sir?"The man leaned forward, a serious look on his face. "Harry, telling me was only the first step. I need her to scan you to diagram your medical ailments throughout your life so that we can take that with us when filing the Dursleys unfit with the Ministry. While there, she can tell us how to heal you from some of the more chronic pains and disorders caused by their lack of care. Do you think you would be amiable to that?"Harry went to intertwine his hands before catching himself and moving them quickly under his thighs. "I-I think I could, but um… could you…" Harry trailed off unsure of himself.He had lost his nerve, wishing he could have something he never had, but he was being a prat. He was shocked when the Professor placed a hand on Harry's thin shoulder. "Could I what, Harry?"Harry wiggled in his seat, his lip coming between his teeth again. The tap to his chin wasn't unexpected, and he let go of the lip and clenched his teeth. He looked uneasily at Severus's black boots. "Tostaywithmeatthecheckup," he rushed out in a mumble."To clarify what little I understood of that, you would like for me to stay while the matron scans you?"Harry blushed, ducking his head, before nodding shakily. He really wanted to have the man be with him as he wasn't comfortable being checked over by anyone, but his Professor knew everything already and was sure to be unsurprised by the findings. He wanted someone safe and well, like Professor Snape.The man scoffed loudly, drawing Harry's eyes to the smirking man. "Well, of course, I would be present. I cannot have an errant matron checking you over and spoiling you rotten with her matronly ways. I needed to be there to oversee and document it as well. You cannot get rid of me that easily, Mr. Potter."Harry could see through the flippant way the Professor spoke, and he knew that the Professor was going to be there to make him feel better. He understood the Professor's need to not show his feelings, but the Professor took it to a point where he wouldn't even show how nice he was. It was probably because of that reputation Snape had talked about Monday.He felt tears coming close to falling and wiped them away quickly. He had no reason to cry, not because someone was finally going to be there for him. That wasn't a reason to cry. He wasn't a bloody baby. He tried to stop it, but he buried his face into the man's sternum and wrapped his arms around him. "Thank you! Thank you, sir!"The Professor patted him on the back, and Harry knew the man felt awkward, probably as awkward as he did. He let go of the man and pulled back into the chair. "Well, yes, of course, you are welcome. I would have it no other way."Harry blushed and looked down again. "You will have lessons with me on Sunday mornings to lunch time, and on Mondays on my open fourth period that seems to be open for you as well. Understood, Mr. Potter?"Harry nodded excitedly. "Yes, thank you, sir! I'll be early every day, I swear!"The Professor inclined his head. "Yes, I believe you. I think we will begin with the quill at first. I will have you write some lines as you must have learned when you were learning how to write. Then we will progress from there. How would you feel learning about magical culture and customs?"Harry nodded, excited to learn anything the man had to teach him. He wanted to be able to impress the man with his skills, and maybe he could just spend more time with the man. "Good, I am glad you could agree to my ideas, and now, here are my terms. You will not slack on your school work, you will let me know when you need more time for homework rather than attend our lessons, you will stay out of trouble, and you will inform me of any material you need to cover in depth. Do you agree?""Of course, sir! Anything, all of it!"The man seemed amused as he smirked. "I will walk you to the infirmary after dinner, but for now, we are going to be late to breakfast if we do not leave in the next few minutes."Harry followed the man's lead as he stood up from where they had been sitting, and the Professor had just agreed to spend more time with him. He was looking forward to their time together.SnapeSeverus was shortening his steps for the small child to keep up with him, which he could admit he had never done for anyone. Why had he been so odd lately? He had kept secrets from Lucius, mostly about what he had been doing in his spare time, that of which he had little as Malfoy junior was in detention every night, because he could not seem to wrap his head around who he had become. He was going soft, the child was making him soft.He had made extra time and reserved extra attention for the child to help him to grow. James Potter's son was going to be taken under his wing as his mentee. He was unsure when he had gotten to this point. He had spent two days conferring with Madame Pomphrey and hiding his doings from Albus Dumbledore. He had never trusted Dumbledore as far as he could throw him, but he was changing for the Potter child. Who would he be by the end of the year?He concealed a weary sigh as he lept them on their path thinking to himself, 'Merlin, help me!'He walked the boy as far as the corridor to the Great Hall. There he stepped back from being inline with the child and made it look as if he was walking a dunderhead to his doom. He guided the boy by his shoulder to the doors and left him to walk in on his own. He strode his way down the center aisle, catching a blonde headed boy slipping in behind him and into a seat at the Slytherin table. He saw the glare on the boy's face, and for once Severus noted it was not directed at him, but it being directed at Harry was not going to make his life any easier.He made himself take what had happened and what he knew and hide behind his Occlumency shields where no one would find them. Walking toward Dumbledore, he brought up a false anger directed at Potter. He did not have to focus on which Potter, and the air of not differentiating would keep his cover. He sat by the madman and inclined his head to Filius sitting at his other side. "Good Morning, Filius."The diminutive man looked at him in disappointment. "Ah, Seveurs, another detention with Mr. Potter?"Severus smirked, all a part of his mask. "The errant boy found it his duty to prank my personal office this morning. He, in his foolish Gryffindor absurdity, deemed my waking hours to be much later than they were and was caught red-handed."The twinkle in Albus's eyes made Severus sneer. "Ah, Severus, boys will be boys."Severus sneered at the man. "That is always your take on it, Headmaster. You never change."The old man frowned. "I haven't any idea what you mean, Severus."Severus scoffed before turning to Filius. "I will be dealing out his detention tonight alongside the young Malfoy Scion.""Is that wise, Severus? I have heard the Malfoy boy is already becoming a problem for the Potter child."Severus looked to Filius, the man giving him a way out of having to deal with Draco tonight. He looked down the table to Minerva. "Minerva, may I trouble you with something?"The scottish witch looked down at him with an arched eyebrow. "Ah, of course, Severus. What do you need of me?""I would ask you to take the Malfoy boy tonight for his detention, and I keep Potter. Consider it a fair trade, a snake to a lion and a lion to a snake."She smirked and turned in her chair with her head cocked. "What will you give me in return, Severus?""Scotch?"She nodded. "I will take the boy, but I expect my scotch by tomorrow."He inclined his head. "Why of course, Minerva. I am a man of my word."She chuckled and moved back to her food. Severus took that time to look at Harry at the Gryffindor table, and he could see the boy picking at his toast, mostly ripping it to pieces. He took his wand under the table and silently moved some food to the boy's plate. He didn't acknowledge the child looking to him this time, not with Albus's attention on him.He glared and swept his look across the room, settling on Draco. The boy was glaring between him and Potter, and Severus could deduct the boy had seen them walking calmly up from the Dungeons. He would have to threaten the boy. Maybe blackmail, maybe detention on his weekends, maybe with telling his mother what he has been saying to Severus and his father. He would think of something for after his first class, first year potions. He would have to inform Draco to see Minerva tonight, and that would be his time to speak about what the ungrateful snot saw.He left before the students, taking the back exit to the alcove before steering toward his dungeons. He opened his classroom for the children to enter, but he was having his first class with the first years, Harry's class. He had settled on who he would be taking down a peg, and he knew it would be risky.He waited until the time was hitting the hour for class to begin, and then he swept into the room. It was silent immediately, and he began with a roll call. He paused on Harry's name, "Ah, yes, Harry Potter. Our… new celebrity."The boy looked confused as his Slytherins snickered at his expense. Severus would make it up to the boy later or explain if needed, but he doubted Harry would not recall his reputation speech from Monday."You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but Severus had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort, most likely in fear of him. "As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death—if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."This is where he would put his plan to the test. He had never singled out a Slytherin before, but to see his godson's head turned from him and ignoring him made his determination set. "Mr. Malfoy! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"The blonde looked up at him in shock. He had heard about his first class his whole childhood, and Severus saw the realization of who Severus had chosen to belittle come over him. "I don't know," the boy spat.Snape's lips curled into a sneer. "Tut, tut-money clearly isn't everything."He ignored the bushy haired girl's hand. A classic know-it-all muggleborn thirsty to prove herself in a world she did not originate. She would be a nuisance. Back to the glaring hotly blonde Slytherin, who had been a thorn in his side. "Let's try again. Malfoy, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?"The boy sneered. "I don't know, Severus."He swept closer to the boy, towering over him. He wanted to wipe that smug look from the boy's face, and this was the best way. "Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Draco?"He ignored the shaking muggleborn girl with obviously no manners or sense of the room. "What is the difference, Malfoy, between monkshood and wolfsbane?""I don't sodding know, Snape, but it seems the filthy mudblood is dying to tell you."No one made a sound, not even his Slytherins. His blood boiled within his veins and his heart thrummed in his chest. He grabbed the boy by the ear, pulling him to his feet and steering him to a corner of the room. He planted the boy in the corner and used a sticking charm on his feet. "Maybe your immature, petty name-calling can be cured by a child's punishment, eh, Draco?"He turned on the rest of the class and sneered. "Sit down," he snapped at Hermione. "For your information, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat, and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?"He swept back to behind his desk with a glare. "And one point from Gryffindor for your lack of decorum, Miss. Granger."He continued with putting their potion on the board, a potion for curing boils, and then split the children up to complete the potion. and swept around like the bat he was known for being. Fifteen minutes into the Malfoy boy's timeout, he let the child sit down with red cheeks stained in embarrassment. He was emboldened by the child's humiliation at his hands and smirked through most of the class, at least until the Gryffindor Longbottom managed to melt the Finnigan boy's cauldron.The Longbottom child was covered in potion and moaning in pain, but Severus was angry that his spite was struck short by the failures of this child. The other child of the prophecy; the one who could have been taken rather than his sister Lily. He hated the boy, actually hated this boy, not for the father or mother, but for what he stood for, what could have been had Voldemort only chosen him."Idiot boy!" Severus snarled at the shaking child. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?"The whimpering boy was a lame lion, a poor excuse of a Gryffindor, better to have been sorted into Hufflepuff. "Take him to the hospital wing," he spat at the Finnigan boy, who had already been several times for exploding any time his wand was waved.Pitiful excuses for wizards. He steered his anger in another direction. "You, Granger, the hand waiver with all the answers, where were you when he was adding those quills too soon? No answer this time… Pity. Another point you have lost for Gryffindor."He saw the Potter boy stand, but luckily, his red-headed friend kicked him. The boy sat down, and Severus was saved from having to scorn the only child in the room he was not trying to tear down. Though it seemed, the child would have words for him. "Continue your potions."He turned from the boy, reigning in the anger he had felt from the beginning of class. He knew why he was angry, and he wanted to curse the Malfoy child more. He hated that word. Mudblood. That word had nearly ruined him, had cost him years with his sister, and had lost him his soul in servitude to a madman. He hated that word, and he had let it get to him, had let the boy get to him.He occluded his mind of the class and let himself go through the motions of berating the children for their failures and slights, except for Harry. He could not stop himself from just ignoring the boy's presence, but he made up for it by tearing into the Weasley boy. It was not his finest insults, but he was now off his game, keeping so many emotions behind his shields.He saw the few minutes they had left and tapped the chalkboard. "Clean your tables and leave. Mr. Malfoy, stay behind to discuss your behavior."The class did as he said, and when the time for everyone to leave came, the Malfoy boy was going for the door with his cronies. He stuck the boy to the ground and swept all other children from the room. He was left with a frustrated Draco, trying unsuccessfully to unstick his feet. Severus swept a hand in the boy's direction, causing the struggling boy to stumble forward. "What kind of sick bastard are you? Buggering my father, convoluting with Potter, and then today!"He swept over the boy in a second, prowling into his space. "Sit, down," he hissed with great restraint. The boy collapsed into his seat, Severus's magic reacting to his orders. "I grow tired of your loose tongue, boy! Continue on this path, and I will be forced to do more than detentions. As it stands, Filch is more than happy to take you on for your new Saturday detentions. Be sure to keep the polish from getting onto your clothes, lest you stain them."The boy looked ready to scream again, but Severus had had it with the boy. He snapped a wrist, and the child was silenced indefinitely. "Try this spell for the rest of the day, Draco. You need to learn not to use such words, or you will be using no words at all. Meet Minerva at her office after dinner for your detention. She has agreed to look after it as I have more important endeavors to accomplish, much more important than you, Mr. Malfoy."The boy glared, breathing deeply with his mouth moving without any noise. Severus smirked. "About Potter, I am not sure what you think you saw, but I can tell you I can show your mother what I have seen of your behavior lately, and living with her, well… that will become a different beast entirely. Do we understand each other, Malfoy?"The boy nodded, his eyes watering. Somehow, Severus did not feel moved. "Get out of my sight."The boy scurried from the room, and Severus smirked into the open classroom. Well, that was until Harry came storming into the room. It was lunch, so he did not have to worry if the child was missing classes. He sighed and sat, exhausted already by just one set of double potions.The boy looked so much like Lily, red with anger and retribution.Severus put up his hands. "Please, allow me. I apologize for my behavior because I am sure it blindsided you. I did not mislead you or lie, and I am not going to be cruel to you. I told you before, I have a reputation, and that is what you just saw. I may have gone too far with Mr. Longbottom, but at that point in the class, I was angered by the word Mr. Malfoy had used to speak of Miss. Granger."The boy looked stunned and drew his head back. "What word? Mudblood?"Severus glared sternly at the boy. "If you ever think of using that word, Potter, your timeout will be in the Great Hall for all to see. Am I clear?"The boy nodded hastily, but he cocked his head, the curious whelp. "What does it mean, Professor?"Severus sighed pinching his nose. He released it and gestured the boy to a stool. He took up one across from the child and levelled the boy with a frown. "It is a slur used for muggleborns, and it means dirty blood. In the wizarding world, some wizards, namely Purebloods, consider people born to non-magical parents to be lesser than those born to magical parents. The followers of Voldemort believed this.""And, Draco?"Severus sneered. "Obviously, Mr. Malfoy has his views, but his attitude is usually not so bold."Harry nodded. "He was really disrespectful, sir, but I think you might have made him feel bad."Severus looked at the boy like he was a conundrum. "What of it, Mr. Potter? Draco has made it quite apparent how he feels about you and has now insulted one of your fellow Gryffindors, so why care how I treat him?"The boy shrugged. "I don't like what he said or how he acts, but you were acting like a bully, sir. Neville seemed really scared as well, and well, I don't think that was right. And, I know Hermoine can be kinda annoying, we all think so, but well, she really just knows a lot of stuff."Severus looked down at this child, this nearly fearless boy, who earlier was cowering, but when faced with defending others… This was why he was a Gryffindor then. Severus inclined his head. "You are right, of course, but this is what I meant, Harry. I am not proud of it, but this is the person I must be. I do not wish for it to get between us, but at this time, I cannot act any differently."The boy bit his lip, and Severus tapped his chin. The boy let the lip go but flexed his hands to show his nerves. "I think I understand, Professor, but could you maybe try not to degrade anyone?"Severus sighed. "I will try, Harry."The boy beamed at him, and Severus felt the class to not be a complete loss if he got to see the boy smile finally. This was what he had worried over for days. The boy was changing him, and he was allowing it to happen. Who was he going to be by the end? Would he even know?

Chapter SevenHarry was walking to defense with dread in his every step. He had finished eating lunch in the Professor's office, which had been nice even though he was still slightly angry with the man, but he did understand. Hermoine was annoying, Harry knew, but he didn't like how hard the Professor had been on her. He was glad he stood up for her, even if it made him feel so nervous afterward. He had been jumpy for all of lunch, but the Professor had been really understanding.Harry sighed, pushing through the crowds to get to the class. He had already spoken to the Professor about the pain he had felt every time he had been to the class this week, but yesterday had been so much worse. It had been when Professor Quirrell used him for a demonstration that his head had nearly split in two. He really didn't want that to happen again, but he would not skip out on class.He met Ron at the door to the classroom and took a seat next to his fellow Gryffindors. There was a commotion going on over by the Slytherins. Harry peeked over to see some people crowded around Malfoy either whimpering in mock comfort in the girls' cases or mocking the boy in the boys' cases. Harry heard from Professor Snape that he was silencing the boy for the day for what he said to Hermoine, but it seemed the blonde Slytherin was going to receive more embarrassment from the punishment.Harry wanted to say that he didn't think it was right, but the blonde had been really disrespectful to Professor Snape, and Ron had even said that Malfoy had not even done their detention correctly. It seemed to Harry like the boy was a complete stuck-up git that liked to bully people, so if Professor Snape wanted to silence the boy, Harry was okay with looking the other way just this once.Harry nudged Ron, "Professor Snape put a silencing spell on Malfoy."His red-headed best friend looked like he might faint. "No way! Snape? He would never?"Harry shrugged. "Well, he did."Ron looked over to the blonde with a smirk. "Watch this."Harry reached out for the boy. "Ron, I don't think…"Ron was already halfway across the room, and Harry wanted to stop him but couldn't seem to make himself. He wanted to be brave, but what if Ron decided that that was why he would stop being his friend. He bit his lip in his nerves to see Ron had reached Malfoy. "Well, what do we have here? Well, Malfoy, what are you? A mute? Slytherin got you tongue?"The Slytherins were even snickering at the blonde's expense, and Harry winced in slight sympathy. Ron leaned toward the boy. "I can't hear you, Malfoy? I heard you like to call people names, what am I, Malfoy? Am I a handsome, brave Gryffindor? Say nothing if you agree… nothing heard. Wow, Malfoy, do you fancy me? Or wait I know who you fancy, it's Granger, right? Say nothing if you agree… Well, there you have it. Malfoy is a muggleborn lover."Harry stood up. "Ron, I don't…"The whole room was snickering until they heard the snap of the door closing. Harry looked to see Professor Quirrell staring at Ron with a confused glare. "M-Mr. W-wealey, p-please, s-sit."Ron ducked his head as he came to sit beside Harry, and Harry smiled to his best friend in reassurance. The red-head smiled weakly in return and turned his head down as he flushed all the way to his ears. Harry could understand as he saw that Professor Quirrell was still staring at Ron with an odd glint to his eye. Harry was shocked to see those eyes turn to him, and his scar flared in pain. He winced, dropping his eyes to look at the desk. What was wrong with him?The class began with instruction on some curses that no one took seriously because the class was a bit of a joke. It had been a waste of time since the first class when Harry and most of his classmates had realized the man stuttered too much to get anything out of it. The man wouldn't even tell them more about his time fighting zombies, real life zombies. Harry was in agreement with everyone, save Hermoine, that this class was a waste of their time.The class finally ended, and Harry was lucky to not have been called up for any demonstration or lack thereof since the man didn't perform one that class period. Harry left the classroom with Ron, who was excitedly talking about how Malfoy had gotten his comeuppance. Harry nodded along, like the good friend he was, and followed the other boy to Charms class.Professor Flitwick was much more interesting even if he did fall from his stack of books too often. They went over the spell from their last class and then split into groups to practice. Harry was practicing with Ron when he felt a slight sting in his arm. He turned to see Malfoy glaring at him. He pulled his eyes from the boy when Ron asked him how the wand movement went, but he could feel the eyes on him for the rest of the class.After Charms, Harry and Ron went to the common room, and even though Harry was making sure to do his homework, he couldn't convince Ron to do the same. It was a few hours later that they were heading to Dinner, and Harry felt his feet dragging. What had he agreed to? Another person to know what had happened to him, was he going barmy? If his Uncle found out… He'd be dead come this summer.Harry sat with his friend and their dormmates, and Harry's head hung as he tried to avoid the dark gaze on him. It was unsuccessful as a tactic as he saw the not so mystery floating food make its way onto his plate. He peeked a look at the Head Table to see the Professor glaring at him.He almost put up a fight this time because honestly he deserved to, he was going to get a check-up, and he hoped it wasn't anything like the muggle ones. Afterwards they would call the Dursleys to get to the bottom of what they found, and the Dursleys would lie and the nice nurse became not so nice and they would call him a liar. His arms would be so sore from how they pushed the shots into him too hard.Now, the Professor was gonna take him to someone like that. He wanted to trust the kind man, he really, really did, but he was so scared. Harry sighed in resignation, knowing he would have to eat even though his stomach was churning with worries. He tucked into his food, his eyes finding the Professors every so often."Hey, Harry."Harry looked over to Ron to see him looking at him with concern. "Yes, Ron.""Mate, why does food always float to you?"Harry felt his face freeze. "I-uh-don't know what you mean?""Sure you do. Every time you get nervous and don't eat, food gets floated to your plate. Is there something wrong, Harry?""No, nothing, Ron. I just get stomach aches sometimes.""Is everything alright, mate?"Harry nodded. "It's fine. Someone is helping me with it."It didn't take long for everyone to finish dinner as he had arrived later than most. He waved off Ron, lying on why he was waiting at the table, and watched Ron walk away worried and not reassured. Maybe he should tell him what's going on, but to do that would mean explaining the Dursleys, defending Professor Snape, and waiting for Ron's reaction. Harry didn't think he could stand if Ron didn't like him after that.He didn't get to worry about that too much as Professor Snape swept past him and directed him toward the doors with a finger. Harry felt like he wasn't present as he got up from his seat and followed after the man. He felt himself shaking, and his hands were intertwined, wringing nervously. He got the tap, but he didn't think he could stop and that realization just made him more nervous.He bit into his lip and whimpered as his mind panicked at another outcome. What if Professor Snape believed the Dursleys too? What if he will hate him too? The thought forced him to stop abruptly along with his breathing. If this led to Professor Snape hating him, he didn't know what he would do. He-He didn't know why he cared, but he wanted to be the man's exception. And, then the Dursley's could ruin that too.The tap to his hands once again made him startle and look up to see the stern professor looking down at him with an arched brow. "Mr. Potter, what do you think those taps to your hands were meant to mean, and furthermore, what do you think my tapping your chin means?"Harry flushed, recalling the many times already the Professor had tapped him on both places. He stopped the actions and lowered his eyes to the floor. Why hadn't he listened the first time? He knew what he was supposed to do, but he had to be an idiot. The man cleared his throat, and Harry felt his shoulders move up to his ears as he flinched. "T-to not do those t-things, sir. 'M sorry."The man made a tutting sound before a stained, pale hand came out and pushed his head up by his chin. The man looked a lot less stern now, which Harry was sure was because he felt near tears. He dug his palms into his eyes to force them back down. He wasn't supposed to cry, but he was just so worried and scared, which just made him feel stupid. "None of that, Harry. You are not stupid, but I do those things to stop the action and to curb your anxiety. There is no need to fear this check-up, Harry. I will be there."Harry's mouth dropped open near the beginning of the speech because he knew he was stupid, but by the end, he was opening and closing it rapidly. "No, sir, you don't understand. The Dursleys… t-they'll… they'll…"Harry cut himself off. What would the man care? Soon he will be on their side too. The man's eyebrow raised. "They'll what, Mr. Potter?"Harry felt a tear spill over. "They'll lie. They'll do it like they always do! They'll… they'll tell the nurse lies and… and you'll hate me."Harry watched in confusion as the man rolled his eyes. "Really, child, do I seem that daft to you? I am not some muggle that can be swayed by some low intelligent, brusque muggles. Believe me, Harry, magic will not allow for their lies. You will not go back there, I will not and could not hate you, and this check-up is only a formality to document their actions as we have already spoken about their abuse. Have I alleviated these idiotic ideas in your head?"Harry found himself nodding rapidly. "Yes, sorry, sir. I just… it always happened that way. They would ask, and I never lied."When put as the Professor had said it, Harry really was being daft. The Professor was a lot smarter than Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, and Harry should trust in that. He felt his nerves lessen as the Professor took his shoulder and steered him in the right direction. If the Professor was around, he was safe, he was sure of it, nothing could hurt him then.They made it to the hospital wing without any more incidents, and they felt reassured with the Professor beside him as the man led him through to one of the many white sheeted, hospital beds. "Sit, and do not move," the man said with a stern look.Harry sat down on the edge of the bed already pushing his hands under his thighs. The Professor walked away, and Harry bit at his lip and took his hands from under his thighs to ring them. He knew for now he could get away with it. Professor Snape came back with a woman in a smock and a funny looking hat. Harry assumed she was Madame Pomphrey.Professor Snape came over to him and glared at his hands. Harry looked away from the man as he pulled his hands apart and sunk them under his thighs. "Good evening, Mr. Potter. It is nice to meet you, of course, though I do wish it were under better circumstances. I am Madame Pomphrey, the school's resident matron."Harry nodded to the lady, smiling nervously at the kind witch. "Hello, ma'am. I-It's nice t-to meet you."She nodded before fluttering around him to get to where he was sitting. Harry tried to contain his flinch when she came near him, but he flinched back anyway, causing her to step back in response. "Don't worry, Potter," she said with a pat to his knee. "This won't hurt a bit. All I shall be doing is giving my wand a wave to run a diagnostic spell, alright, Mr. Potter?"Harry nodded, and she smiled. "It should only be a minute, of course, and then if need be, we can get you healed up."Harry nodded through his now trembling body, looking to Professor Snape for help. Professor Snape nodded and moved closer to him. "She is speaking honestly, Harry. There is nothing to worry about."Harry bit his lip, his hands flexing nervously from beneath his legs. He felt the tap to his chin and realized he had been biting into it. He let his lip loose and stared at his knees. "None of that, ask your question."Harry smiled up at the man, who seemed to read him so easily. He always knew what he wanted. "You are staying, right, Professor? Please?"The man's eyebrows rose, but Harry noted with some small amount of relief that he inclined his head. "Of course."Harry smiled faintly in thanks before turning his gaze back to the smirking Madame Pomphrey. "I-uhm I'm ready, Ma'am."The Matron nodded and waved her wand in an intricate pattern, producing a bright light over Harry. He felt a slight twinge in his chest before a piece of parchment appeared out of thin air into Madame Pomphrey's hands. Harry licked his lips nervously as the woman's face went white as the sheets underneath Harry. "Uhm, is everything alright? Did I do something wrong?"Professor Snape went over to her after patting Harry on the leg in reassurance. Harry watched in growing concern as his face went red with what could only be rage. The man seemed so angry for a second before his face cleared of all emotions. Then he looked at Harry, and it was back. "Those monsters," the man seethed.Harry flinched at the tone, moving away from the two angry looking adults. Professor Snape seemed to notice first, and then he was suddenly emotionless again. He tapped Madame Pomphrey and nodded toward a door in the back. He and the mediwitch went toward a back office while Harry tried to calm his panicked breaths.He spent the time trying to realize what he had done wrong. The Professor had seemed so angry when he had looked at him, and he knew he was supposed to be calm, supposed to be trusting the man, but he could hardly stop himself from nearly panicking. What if what they saw wasn't going to help him? What if they knew he was a freak now?It wasn't long before Professor Snape came back to him, caring vials of what must have been potions. "Calm yourself, Potter. We are not angry at you. We were having an adverse reaction to your relatives and their treatment of you."Harry's head cocked to the side in his confusion. "Why?"The Professor's brows drew together. "Because it was deplorable, Harry. No one deserves that. No one. You were a child in their care. You deserved more."Harry shrugged. "I'm used to it."That didn't seem to make the man feel any better. "You should not be accustomed to this, Harry."He thought he heard the man say something, but suddenly, the man was there beside him, having him sit up and lean against the pillows. The man silently, but not unkindly, handed him each potion, which Harry took without complaint. By the last one, he felt very drowsy and succumbed to the feeling as someone pulled the sheets over the top of him.SnapeSeverus looked down at the child in the bed. The boy was very strong to go through what he had. He had endured so much at the muggles' hands that Severus himself was contemplating hurting them in ways that he had not imagined since he was a Death Eater. He had hated being a Death Eater, had hated torturing muggles, but now, when a child had been threatened and hurt, he was coming back to those thoughts more and more while thinking of that lengthy piece of parchment produced by Poppy."Is he asleep?"Severus turned to where Poppy stood by the door to her office. "Yes, a dreamless one at that. I thought he deserved it after all that he has gone through."She nodded, looking at the boy in bed. "Did he have any questions?"Severus glared at her, his eyebrows lowered. "None. You would have known that if you had not decided this called for hysterics. Honestly, Poppy, you call yourself a professional when one abuse case sends you spinning."The matron glared at him, but Severus stayed by his statement. She was meant to be a professional, like he was. She should have kept her head. Harry deserved better than some weak willed witch. "Well, I'm sorry, Severus, some of us have feelings for the boy and his family beyond hatred and petty childhood revenge."Severus felt his hackles rise. "Do not presume to know how I feel or deem yourself able to tell me, witch!"She looked slightly apologetic and that was more than Severus was accustomed. He would take that small nuance. "I am capable of compartmentalization, that does not make me unfeeling. Especially not in cases like this."Severus was not one to talk about his feelings, but he did not need some witch presuming to know him. He could be whoever he wanted to inside of himself, and no one told him how he felt. He had only so many things he could decide for himself about his character, and his helping of children hurt by abusers was one he had picked and was fiercely protective of against scrutiny of any kind.She turned away from him, messing with papers on her desk. "I will inform Minerva and Albus."Severus snorted. "As if the old fool will listen. Be sure you bring evidence because he will never believe you otherwise. And be sure to only bring copies, no need to lose originals to the old man's skewed views of the world and his god-complex."She looked shocked, but she nodded all the same. "When should I go then, Severus?"He sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Not any time soon. I need time to gather my information and work with it. I will allow Minerva to know as Potter is a Gryffindor, but I think it best that you convey discretion to her."She nodded and then left, and Severus became unsure of where he should go. He had gotten the boy to the nurse, healed him as much as he could, and had settled things with the witch. Where should he go now?He looked down to the boy. He could not leave the boy because to leave him vulnerable now would be a chance for Albus to sink his needling words into the boy. He needed to speak with someone, preferably Lucius, who would be in charge of the next steps of his plans. He spelled two chairs, a more comfortable and regal one for the pureblood. He would just need to firecall Lucius from within the infirmary.He went to the fireplace and took the powder from the shelf overhead before sending a pinch into the flames. He shouted the password to Lucius's office, kneeling with his head near the flames. He received a fiery head of the man with a bothered look. Severus smirked at the man from his position. "What is it, Severus? I am currently in no mood to kneel here on the floor like a common pauper."Severus internally chuckled before standing back and gesturing for the man to come through the floo into the infirmary. "Come through then, Lucius."The man sniffed arrogantly before coming through, looking like a regal peacock. Severus closed the connections between the two floos and gestured Lucius over to the rows of beds. The man nodded and strode forward to the set of chairs Severus had left for them. He picked the correct chair and sat in it with his regal masks still in place.Severus sighed while warding the floo and drawing privacy wards around their small portion of the room. He joined the blonde haired man in the open seat and rubbed at his temples. The once snide look melted, and the concerned frown Severus expected took over. Trust Lucius to see when he was bothered when no one else had in the past few days."Where have you been these past few days, Severus?"Severus growled low in his throat. "I have been busy."Lucius looked less than impressed by his irritation. "So, what, have you forgotten how to communicate completely? No letters, no floo calls, just complete silence, and after the last time we met?"Severus shrugged. "What of it?""Well, you do remember how agitated we were, and how you said you weren't ready to speak to me yet? I have waited patiently, Severus, but I am not a patient man."Severus folded his arms over his chest. "I have been pursuing another case."Lucius raised an eyebrow. "Well, that does change things, but honestly, Severus, you haven't treated a case of child abuse like this in years."Severus sighed and uncharacteristically ran a hand back through his hair. "Don't you think I know that, Lucius."The other man's face pinched. "Why is it so special to you then, Severus?"Severus leaned back in the chair he had taken up, his body feeling exhausted. "I was very mistaken for all these years, all the petty thoughts and feelings. They were all wrong, and well, we, the wizarding world, were all wrong."The blonde leaned forward with his eyebrows drawn together and his hands twitching. Severus could see how much Lucius wanted to do more, and how the lack of information on how he could help was killing him. Severus hated how he needed to speak with the man, but he would have to be more specific if he did not want to put up with a frustrated Lucius Malfoy. "In the bed is Harry Potter."The man's face did not change from the worried, anxious frown that marred his usually smirking lips. Severus was only partly surprised. "He has been abused, Lucius."The man moved to the edge of his chair, most of his upper body resting on the head of his cane, probably to keep from drawing his wand in his anger. "You discovered it of course," the man acknowledged.Severus nodded, even though it was unnecessary as they both knew it was always he who discovered the abuse cases in the school. "The muggles, I assume?"Again, Severus nodded, causing Lucius to curse this time. The man raked a hand across his face and levelled Severus with a softened look. "This was why you have been acting so off these past few days?"Severus cleared his throat, trying to go for his usual cool responses. "It has been trying of course."The other man arched an imperial brow. "I know what she meant to you, and I also know how personally you take these cases. It must be a great deal harder than trying, Severus, but I will let you come to me when you are ready to discuss it. For now, how bad?"Severus closed his eyes, his mask was coming apart for a moment as his hands smoothed at the ache between his brow. He had wanted to speak more with Lucius these past few days, had needed to really, but he had been so caught up in all his thoughts and the old feelings Harry had brought up that he had been unable to make himself. He regretted that decision now as he would need the man's help with not only Harry but also getting through his own thoughts and feelings."He had full malnutrition starting at age fifteen months, broken bones left to heal incorrectly, illnesses left untreated, burns, concussions, and that is just what Poppy's spells can tell us. It cannot provide for the emotional or mental abuse suffered at their hands. However, Harry's actions speak loud enough as well as the legilimency I performed on him as a record to use in a case against those beasts.""Harry, Severus?"Severus barely kept himself from flushing in embarrassment. "The boy opened up to me, and I find myself unsure, Lucius. It feels odd acting as I have around the boy. The care I take to keep myself from scaring him. The way I accommodate him. I even offered him lessons, Lucius! Lessons with me! He didn't deserve what they did, and… I am acting so out of character with him. Caring even."The man chuckled. "You act as if you do not act caring, Severus. Besides, you treating an orphaned, child abuse case kindly is not the end of the world. You care for a child. It is not so hard to believe. You have cared for all the children that have fallen under your care."Severus shook his head. "It is different with Harry. I want to help him more than just to heal physically but emotionally as well. I want to teach him, and I worry for him. I feel responsible for him, and it is maddening."Severus felt his face flush in anger at the bark of laughter he received. He glared at the blonde affronted. "Severus, you make it sound as if being a father figure to the boy is some crime. He is Lily's son, your best friend, your sister in all but blood, and he is abused. Truthfully, I am not surprised. Just allow yourself time to get through your feelings and to build a rapport with the boy. Spend some of your time with him. He could use the support, I am sure!""Are you mad, Lucius? I am no father figure. Do you know me at all? I would be a mentor, a guide. Yes, that will be how I help him. I will mentor the boy. Give him support in knowledge and skill."The blonde snorted. "Yes, that is all. I am so sure of it, Severus. Just a mentor, no feelings involved. Well, if that is all you need me for…""No, I feel I may need you to help me get around the Ministry as well as the old codger. I need to work with the Child Services department, and I am sure Albus will be unconcerned and try to dissuade me and Poppy from our pursuals. I believe we need to usurp the Dursley's guardianship while also keeping it from the press."The blonde smirked, his Slytherin showing. "And who shall take over his guardianship in the interim?"Severus shrugged. "No one yet, of course. We have time. I promised Harry we would discuss it and do so extensively to get the most favorable candidate."The man smirked wider at Severus, his eyes amused. "But of course."Severus glared. He did not like what his partner was getting at, pushing him as he was. "Back to the topic at hand, I have his health report and his statement for you. The rest you will accomplish quietly, understood?"The man leered. "Now, Severus, you and I both know I am the picture of discretion."The wink and accompanying smirk sent his way was not missed, and Severus scowled. "Good, you can see your way out now, Lucius."The blonde chuckled as he stood and began the walk back to the fireplace. " I will contact you with the guardianship papers filled out for you, Severus. I am sorry to say you will have to take the guardianship until a more permanent option is found."Severus nodded as it seemed to be an option to keep the boy out of ministry hands. He would hold it until an actually suitable guardian came along. "Very well, Lucius. I will call you soon."The man smirked. "You had better, Severus. This certainly would not make up for the lack of attention paid upon me in the last two days."He entered the floo, and Severus was left with the young boy in the bed as his company. He had made a promise to the boy to be there, and he thought he had served his time to the fullest. He could be back in the morning and leave wards up to know if the child was disturbed in the night. He was not one to sit at bedsides and worry over children. No, he was a mentor, nothing more or less than that, and the sooner he started acting that way, the better.

Chapter 8 (Thursday)Harry scowled in his sleep as his eyes felt the slight touch of light. He opened his eyes to see the lights on in the infirmary and other people being seen to by Madame Pomfrey. He looked around his own blocked off bed space for the Professor but was left sad and hurt when he realized he was nowhere close.Harry thought the man would be, but well, he hadn't asked, and well not like he was special or anything to the Professor. He was just a stupid student, a freak. That was all he was.He sighed and jumped when he realized Madame Pomfrey was headed his way. He should be up, freak like him weren't allowed to mope around in bed. He should be up, not laying in the nice bed. He shouldn't even be in a bed. He was going to be in so much trouble.He scattered from the bed, stumbling as his short legs found the floor and nearly sent him to the ground. He was sent backwards onto his bum as he saw the nurse was in front of him. He scooted back, knowing he was in so much trouble. How could he have been so stupid? He was daft, and a freak, and ungrateful!"Mr Potter, you're fine. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise. I actually would like you to get back into the bed so that I may look you over. I just want to be reassured that you are healed and discuss further treatment."Harry was shaking. He didn't believe her. He couldn't believe her. It was a trick to make him get into even more trouble. He knew this game. He had played it often with the Dursleys, but he didn't want more punishment. He was already in for it. He wasn't allowed on beds, he knew it. He was such a freak.He scooted under the bed, feeling secure in the enclosed space, like his cupboard. He was safe, like in his cupboard. Safe."What is going on here?"Harry whimpered at the angry tone while at the same time wanting to see the dark-haired man. His Professor was here. His body froze because he was scared but also wanted to examine the man with his own eyes, to know he was there to save him. He couldn't decide where to move, if farther under the bed was safer or where he could see the Professor was safer. He just didn't know anymore, and he was so confused to have woken up here all alone."The child has huddled himself under the bed, Severus. Please, I don't think I am getting through to him. He was very disoriented waking here this morning."Harry listened to the nurse speak to his Professor, but none of her words mattered. She was going to lie. She had tricked him into being on the bed, he just knew it. He heard the steps coming closer and hoped they were his Professors. He wanted to see the man to be reassured. Black boots stepped up to the edge of the bed, and Harry felt his heart pounding in his chest.The man knelt by the bed and leaned over where Harry could finally see his face. He didn't look pleased to see him, but he also didn't seem very angry either."What is the meaning of this?"Harry whimpered at the scolding tone and folded his face up in his bent legs. The man was going to be angry with him then. Why had he even hid here? It was just a check-up, and they had put him on the bed. Why had he let himself act like such a freak?"M'sorry," he bemoaned from his hiding space in his knees.He heard a snort and peaked to see his Professor was sitting on the floor faced away from him. He felt slightly better at not having more attention on him. "I am sure this was another incident brought about by the Dursleys."Harry nodded but realized quickly that his Professor wouldn't see it. "Yes, sir. I... well, they told me I wasn't allowed on beds. They said I would ruin them, and sometimes, they'd trick me. I thought... I'm not sure why, but I thought Madame Pomfrey was going to trick me like them too so she could punish me more."Harry looked around nervously at that admission. Why had he even said all of that? He wasn't supposed to go around belly-aching over things. He was acting like such a little cry-baby. So what, he wasn't allowed on beds, doesn't mean he had to go acting like a twat."Harry, I want you to know that here, you can sleep on any bed offered to you. Furthermore, if I find out you have not been sleeping when you are supposed to, where you are supposed to, I will be very displeased."Harry smiled shyly as he saw the Professor catching his eye. "Yes, sir. I will sleep in my bed from now on."The man sighed and gestured with a hand. "Come out now, Harry. I will call the Matron back so she can check you over, and then I will send you to breakfast and to your classes for the day."Harry blushed but did as the man said and left his place under the bed. The man was already standing once he escaped and helped him to his feet as well. He clenched his teeth as he felt the urge to bite his lip, but he kept himself from that and from flinching as the man helped settle him onto the bed. His Professor swiped his wand over him a few time to remove the dust from his pyjamas before moving toward the back where the nurse's office was.Harry waited patiently and contritely, already feeling bad for how he had acted this morning and not willing to act up more. The two adults came back to him, and the Matron smiled disarmingly at him without a hint of irritation. Harry relaxed slightly at her good mood and allowed her to wave her wand over him while his Professor stayed close to his side, watching over him.The check-up finished quickly, and the Matron mentioned continuing on some nutrition potions during breakfast before leaving Harry with his Professor. Harry watched as the man settled into a chair by his bed and wondered when the man had conjured it. Since it had been in the last hour, he could only assume the man had sat there last night after he had fallen asleep. The thought warmed him from the inside out and left him smiling at the man.Snape"Well, Mr Potter, have you any questions?"Severus watched as the child smiled at him so unabashedly and felt his own blackened heart warm slightly. What right did he have to receive such joy from a child? He was unaware why the boy was smiling, but he would enjoy it for the short time it remained. He was sure the child would be upset to hear that he would have to take his guardianship until another alternative could be found. Still, Severus was sure the boy could be consoled."Uhm, yes, sir. She said, something about potions."Severus nodded and gave the boy a reassuring look. "Yes, Harry, you will have to take a nutrition potion for about three months to help combat the malnutrition you suffered from your relatives."The boy's nose scrunched up. "Three months? That's a long time."Severus smirked hearing the boy give a slight complaint. He doubted the child realized he was complaining. However, it was still nice to know that potions were universally disliked by all children, abused or not."It was a long time without proper nutrition, but not to worry, I will be sure you get the potion every morning with your meal. Any other questions, Harry?"The boy looked down at his hands and shrugged. "I just, does this mean I don't have a guardian anymore?"Severus sighed and looked briefly to the heavens for strength. "No, a friend is taking our proof to the proper authorities to oust the Dursleys from their place as your guardian. At such a time as that happens as quickly and quietly as possible, your guardianship will transfer to me for the brief time it takes us to search for you a proper guardian."The boy looked placated. "Yes, sir."Severus smirked standing from his place by the child's bedside and gestured to the food and clothes by the child's bed. "There you will find breakfast and a change of clothes, and your bag is at the foot of the bed. Is there anything else I can do for you, Harry?"The boy smiled at him with a shake of his head. "No, sir. Just, uh, thanks for helping me so much."Severus nodded and swept away from the bed, knowing he would need to get to the Great Hall as to not raise the suspicion of a certain twinkly-eyed Headmaster.Severus arrived at the Great Hall in time to see the owl post arriving. He was happy to have received none this morning, even if he was looking forward to hearing from Lucius. He was a tad short with the man, more so than he usually allowed, but he was sure that the man understood.It was hard for him to be this fazed by a child. He had always helped those abused children, but their plight and their emotions had never effected him to this extent.After a long night of meditating and Occlumency, Severus had made peace with the idea that Harry could change him. Harry was Lily's son, and the boy had his own merits and his own personality. He was kind and courageous, and Severus did not want to feel bad for being helpful to a child who deserved so much more.Severus was going to mentor the boy and make him whole so that the child faced as little adversity from his background as possible. After the boy had finally picked his guardian, Severus would even be content to continue to mentor the child. He could be a temporary guardian to the boy, but he doubted any child would want more from a man like Severus Snape.He sighed and turned back to his breakfast. Albus seemed to be focused on other things today and was leaving him be, but Minerva was practically shouting at him with her eyes. He inclined his head to her and gestured for the alcove at the teacher's entrance.She was already sweeping away while he allowed himself to sip from his morning tea. He finished the cup and swept from the table to the side entrance to have what was sure to be a stimulating conversation with the Gryffindor Head of House.Severus saw her pacing and sighed as he warded the room for their privacy. He was already aware of what they would be speaking on, and he had prepared himself mentally for this kind of conversation. Poppy had obviously told her about Harry, and Severus could see from the open emotions on her face that it had eaten away at her all night."Minerva?"She spun, looking at him with anger in her eyes. "Why? Why, Severus, have you not told me? Why would you even know before me? What were you doing to Harry to find out this information?"Severus felt tense all over and arched a brow at her. What did she think of him to ask him that last question? "What is it that you are implying, witch? And, take care in your words?"She sighed, seeming to deflate in the face of his ire. "No, no, Severus. I-I am sorry. I don't mean anything of that sort. I just... why didn't he tell me?"Severus sighed, his anger leaving him in that breath. He could understand her reactions and would even excuse them in this case. Another change he was going to contribute to Harry Potter and his confounded effect on Severus Snape."He hardly told me, but luckily, I am able to see the signs. He didn't want to go to anyone, Minerva, but I have been able to get through to him."She looked at him with pain. "Is it truly as bad as Poppy said, Severus?"Severus wanted to reassure her, but in this, he had to be honest. He nodded and watched as the usually stern witch let a tear slip from her eye. Severus felt a tad uncomfortable seeing someone he had seen as a mentor act so well, human. He would have to get used to such actions as he was sure the boy was just as human if not more than the adult witch in front of him. "He has been healed as far as we can at this juncture, but he will be on nutritional potions for the next three months. However, his growth might be stunted irrevocably from the treatment. Time will tell, of course."She nodded, stemming her tears faster than Poppy had been able and centring herself. "What are we doing about this, Severus?"We. Minerva already included herself on his side of things, but to say he had a side was to create an opposition. He supposed the enemy could be the Dursleys, but they were hardly a worthy opponent. If he was honest with himself, he would admit his current enemy was Albus. They would have to work around the man to get Harry into a safe home and to keep him there."I have someone working within the Ministry to get guardianship swapped silently."She nodded, already understanding what the silence referred to, or incorrectly assuming it was only to do with the press. Either way, discretion was one thing Severus was sure Minerva was capable of, especially in this matter. "What is to be done with the vermin?"Severus arched an eyebrow at her vengeful tone but smirked to himself. "I have not yet decided. Traditional methods are out as the publicity would harm Harry more than help him. Thoughts?"She smiled like the cat she sometimes was and nodded. "I am aware of where they reside and can come up with some ideas."Severus thought of letting her take over the punishment. It would be much less lethal coming from her, and Severus would not have to worry about being taken away from H... helping Harry. He was needed here, and he did not trust himself to be around those monsters for longer than the time it would take to gather their signatures. Even in that, he was sure he would entrust the duties elsewhere."I only ask to see the memories afterwards, Minerva."She nodded and strode away. Severus breathed deeply at the feeling of near happiness that had brought. Harry could have his retribution even if he never learned of it and would never ask for it.HarryHe could see everything: the hairs on his arms, the little scars across his hands, the threadbare look of his pants. Everything there was to see, he could see. His face hurt from smiling so much, but he was so happy he could hardly contain it.He looked to where his Professor was waiting for him by the entrance to the eye doctor. The man's face had hardly changed from the usual stern look, but there was that smile in his eyes that Harry knew to look for. Harry bounded his way over to the man with a laugh and threw himself into the man's sternum. He heard a chuckle from behind him, and it was probably the eye doctor, but he could hardly contain himself. He could see!Harry's Professor was a little less tense near the end of the hug, and Harry allowed himself to be moved away from the man slightly. He was still smiling as the man looked down at him with a raised eyebrow. Harry laughed because not even the man's somewhat stern face could ruin this moment for him. "Thank you, sir! Thank you so much!"The man seemed to turn very red, and Harry realized that his Professor was blushing. Harry bit at his lip to keep from laughing and turned back to the Doctor. The man was looking at them slightly curiously and with a wide grin on his face. Harry kept himself from hugging the stranger, but he really did want to show his appreciation. "Thank you, sir! They're brilliant!"The man nodded and patted his shoulder. "You are very welcome, young man. I hope to see you again in six months for a check-up." The man turned his attention to his Professor with a slight frown. "You will bring him back, won't you?"His Professor glared and nodded. "Of course."Harry could tell the man had held back from saying something snappish, so Harry patted the man's hand. His Professor looked at his questioningly before rolling his eyes. "We are going. Thank you, Doctor."Harry smiled as he followed his Professor out of the room and through the waiting room. He waved at the receptionist and pretty much every person he saw because he could actually see them!His Professor placed a hand on his shoulder and steered him from the room. He didn't seem angry, but Harry knew he could be short-tempered. He didn't mind as his Professor always treated him nicely. Harry was sure it was because he was his exception.They went next to a clothing store. According to the Professor, his clothes weren't fit for a garbage heap. Harry had felt nervous when the man said they were getting more than glasses because the deal had been he needed glasses as to not hurt anyone in the Professor's class. What was the reason for clothes? He had clothes. None of them fit, but he had them. Freaks didn't need new clothes.Harry sighed, following the man. His Professor stopped them both and looked down at him. "Why do you sound like a kettle?"Harry grinned at the man's attempt at humour, but it didn't last as his feelings came back. He flexed his hands as he felt the need to twiddle them anxiously. He just didn't understand. This was more than they had agreed to get. He was going to be a burden."Sir, you said I was getting glasses today."The man didn't seem to understand where he was going as his look did not change. "That I did."Harry sighed, running his fingers through his messy hair in frustration. "You never said anything about clothes."The man sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. His Professor knelt in front of him and grabbed his arms in his hands. "Harry, when we spoke on Friday, what were you wearing?"Harry felt shame roll through him. He had been in his clothes from the Dursleys after having gone to see Hagrid with Ron. Any clothes from the Dursleys were too big and old cast-offs. He knew what they must look like to someone like his Professor, who always seemed so put together. "Clothes, sir."The man sighed again and tapped his chin. Harry took his lip out from between his teeth reluctantly. "Those were hardly allowed to be called clothes, the same as the ones you are wearing now. I am only asking you to allow me to get you a few things to last you the school year. That is all, Harry.""But why, sir? I have clothes. They are what I deserve."The man seemed frustrated, but he didn't change his loose hold on his arms or get upset. Harry knew the man was different from the Dursleys, but Harry was still a freak. A freak in anyone's care was just a freak. He had clothes, he would be ungrateful to ask for more.The man seemed to flinch back from their staring contest, and Harry wondered why the man seemed to affected. Harry hadn't said anything in the last minute, but the man looked shocked."Harry, what are you?"Harry was surprised. Was this where his Professor made him say what he was, confirm it aloud so that everyone knew? Harry was upset, but he resigned himself to that fate. "A freak, sir."The man flinched again, and Harry looked up from where his eyes had dropped. The man looked so upset and red in the face. Harry wanted to move away from the man, but he had a hold of his arms. "Harry, if I ever hear you call yourself that again, in your head or not, I will have you in detention for a month."Harry looked at the man in confusion. "But, sir, I'm a f-""Harry, I suggest you stop there. I am telling you, now, that what those vile creatures called you was wrong. You are no freak. They are the freaks. What they did to you was freakish and wrong. You are a normal boy. A normal eleven-year-old boy who did nothing wrong to cause their treatment of you."Harry looked at the man and felt tears pooling in his eyes. Was he wrong all this time? His Professor said he was, and the man was usually right. Still, he had been told he was a freak for so long. How could the man be so sure?"How can you be so sure, Professor?"The man did something so shocking, Harry had dropped his mouth open in surprise. The man grabbed him, and well, he hugged him. It was only a moment, and afterwards, the Professor was on his feet and a foot away, but Harry was hugged by someone else! His Professor had hugged him!"Now, I know it will take time, but I will keep reminding you that those creatures were wholly incorrect in nearly every word they spoke."Harry smiled at the man and nodded his understanding. He might not feel confident that the man was right, but he would try to understand the man's point of view.His Professor led him by a hand on his shoulder into the store. Harry was shocked at the size and everything around him. Muggle stores were so much larger than wizarding ones, and Harry felt himself edging closer to his Professor as they made their way inside.They went straight to the boy's clothes and wasted no time in getting everything the Professor said. The man grabbed him a few shirts, jeans, underwear, socks, and shoes before leading him to the pyjamas and allowing him to pick two pairs of those. Harry was content with that amount, and the man seemed less irritated as well.His Professor bought the clothes, which left Harry somewhat uncomfortable but also warm inside. He had never had anyone buy him something like this. His first pair of new clothes ever had been for school this year, but even then, he had had to buy them. It felt almost like a gift as the man handed him a set of clothes and sent him to change into them.Harry was giddy as he pulled the t-shirt, jeans, and new trainers on, but he tried to rush and not linger. He took his old clothes with him to meet his Professor, but the man just directed him to the trash can near the entrance. Harry felt an odd feeling surge in his stomach as he tossed away the clothes that had never really been his.His Professor grabbed his shoulder and steered the way they had come that afternoon. They entered the Leaky Cauldron and went straight to the floo, and just like when they came in, Professor Snape took him with him through the floo with a hand on his shoulder.They were spat out in Professor's Snape's office, and Harry smiled up at the man who steadied him on his swaying feet. His Professor smirked at him before handing him his shopping. Harry took the bags with a grin and turned that same grin back to the man. "Thank you, Professor. I will be sure to pay you back when I can get to Gringotts."The man sighed as he gestured him to sit at their chairs in the man's office. Harry took his blue chair and allowed the bags in his hands to curb his nervous habits. "I will not accept any money."Harry looked up, shocked at the straight-forward announcement. "Why not? I can pay. I have the money."His Professor stopped him with a hand. "It is not about money, Harry. Consider the clothes as a gift, one I would like you to take care of. Can you do that, Mr Potter?"Harry nodded. "I will make sure they stay clean, sir."His Professor rolled his eyes. "I do not mean you cannot wear them to their full extent, Mr Potter. I mean, do not lose them or give them away like some boys do with their friends. Please, have fun and use them as much as you like. And while I am making demands, throw away everything those vile creatures gave you. Understood?"Harry nodded, and his Professor seemed to relax. "Good, you may leave, I am sure you have homework to attend to, but I will see you tomorrow to go over quills."Harry nodded happily and jumped up from his seat. He was already so excited to show Ron what he had got. "Thanks again, Professor, and see you tomorrow."The man waved him off, and Harry ran for the doors and down the corridors. He was so excited and happy. He was the man's exception, and he had been given a gift!

Hey, everyone, glad to let out some more chapters on this one. I have made a good outline, but this was a lengthier chapter. I also added some stuff outside the outline, but eh, it was dope. I wanted to let anyone who is reading any of my other stories that this will probably be my last chapter for the week as I have some guests coming this weekend for my 22nd birthday. Promise, I am coming back probably on Monday night to give you all another update to this story and Farce hidden Father. Glad you guys are reading, and well have a good weekend, everyone!Chapter NineSeverus was pacing, waiting on the boy to join him for their afternoon lessons. He had gotten a book typically used for young children learning their letters and procured a practice quill for the occasion. He even had debated and decided to draw up some tea and biscuits for the too-small child. The slight boy could use some more meat on him, and Severus would only be doing what he should as the boy's mentor.It was five minutes till when the boy knocked on the door as timidly as expected. Severus strode to the door and opened it slowly, allowing the easily startled child time to process the movement. He looked down as the door opened fully, taking in the child in his new clothes and his cheeks a tad red most likely from running down from lunch."Come in, Harry."He stepped to the side and gestured the child over to a desk with a hand. The child settled down in the chair tall enough to reach the edge of Severus's desk, and Severus followed, sitting in his own chair behind the desk. The child was already smiling at him and seeming cheery in his presence. It was not what most children would consider a matter of cheer, but Severus was already aware Harry was different from other children."Well, Harry, I am glad you could make it here on time. As discussed before, we will be going over quills and writing with them. Now, show me how you hold your quill?"Severus watched as the boy demonstrated his improper hold. Severus gently and carefully showed the child the correct form for holding the quill and then set him to doing repetitions of the alphabet. The child smiled and did as he was told while Severus spent his time completing grading he needed to have finished for the week.The boy had finished two to three sheets, and Severus noted his competency increasing as he finished the lines. Severus tapped the child to gain his attention and gestured to where the tea and biscuits were waiting for them in the sitting area. The child jumped to his feet with a grin and sat in his blue chair. Severus joined the child in the chair of his own and set about giving the child his tea in the overly sweet fashion he preferred."Thanks, Professor. This is really great."Severus inclined his head and took his own tea, sipping from the saucer. The child looked to him his teeth near biting his lip. Severus arched an eyebrow and saw the nervous glance to the biscuits on the tea service. Severus rolled his eyes and placed two of the treats onto a plate for the child. "Eat, you are much too thin."The boy grinned all boyish and full of happiness as he ate the two biscuits. Severus wanted to flush at having caused such an innocent child such emotion. However, he was more in control of himself today and could negate that reaction. He was slightly pleased with himself to have caused such boyish excitement from the child.Severus was unsurprised to hear the floo go off as his expected visitor arrived. Harry, who had not been expecting Lucius, jumped in his chair, nearly spilling his tea. The boy righted himself and looked nervously to the man that was walking to join them. Severus waved a hand at the boy and waved a wand to conjure another chair for their guest. He took the time Lucius used to strut to his place to ward the office and floo for privacy, not taking chances that the old codger would not be listening in on them.Severus turned back to his guests to see the boy had sunk into his chair and seemed to be wringing his hands nervously. Severus tapped the boy's hands and watched the stare Lucius had had on the child turn to him. The man was incorrigible, smirking at him, knowing how that look made Severus feel.Severus shook himself and looked to the boy, his face automatically softening. "Harry, this is my friend I mentioned. He is the one helping at the Ministry. He wanted to speak with you. Lucius, this is Harry Potter."His partner extended his hand and allowed the boy to meet him halfway. Severus appreciated the man's ability to act slowly and carefully to stop the child from flinching. Harry grasped the man's hand with a wane smile and ducked his head. "Nice to meet you, sir."Severus was surprised at the genuine smile on Lucius's face. "Nice to meet you as well, Harry. How are you today?"Severus kept his eyes on the boy as the child grinned. "Great, sir. The Professor was just helping me with quills, and now we're having tea and biscuits. I even had two!"His partner smiled at the child, and Severus was left to contemplate how excited one child could become from a mentoring session. "Ah, I am glad to hear it. Well, I came to speak with you about what I am doing for you within the Ministry."That caused the excitement to fade from the child and for the boy to curl into himself. Severus was happy to see the child had not started with his anxious hand twining or his lip biting. Still, there was something more disconcerting about the child curling into himself so tightly. Severus found his hand already reaching for the child and settling gently on his too-thin knee in reassurance. "Try not to look so frightened, Harry. Lucius is only going to explain what he has done so far as well as get a feel as to what he will do next."Severus glared at his partner to see how the man responded, and Lucius surprised him by already crouching by the child's chair with a kind face. "I do not wish to upset you, child."Harry nodded to the man, and Severus was reassured when he unfurled a little. "I-I uh, know, sir. Sorry.""Forget that. I was only trying to explain how I have taken the evidence your Professor gathered and made contact with a member of the Wizarding Department of Child Services."The boy bit his lip, and Severus tapped the child's chin in reproach. "Who, sir?"Lucius smiled kindly. "She is a kind woman, one who has been made aware of the need for discretion. She is working with a solicitor to declare the Dursleys unfit. She will then file the necessary paperwork with the Ministry without alerting anyone to the change."The boy seemed to shake as he listened to Lucius. Severus was surprised that the child was not relieved to hear this, but he also knew the child was always capable of surprising him. Severus tilted the boy's ducked head with a finger to his chin and saw the tears in the boy's eyes. Severus sighed, gesturing for Lucius to sit back in his seat. Severus was surprised to see his partner listen to him, but disregarded the notion of being obeyed by the bull-headed man."Harry, are you alright, child?"The boy nodded, his breathing slightly harsh as he stared at Severus. "I-I... I never thought it would be real.""That what was real," Severus prompted.The boy's eyes were teary, but they stared at him with so much emotion. "That people would listen to me. You... You got people to fight for me."Severus flinched at the near admiration in the boy's voice. "Harry, I do not believe I... Anyone would do the same in my place."The boy shook his head, his lip between his teeth again. "No, they didn't. They all listened to the Dursleys and thought me a liar. You... You believed me and made others believe me. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much."The boy flung himself into his arms, and Severus caught the child in his arms. The tiny limpet clung to him, his teary face in his chest. Severus tried to avoid the eyes of his partner as the man watched their interaction with a smirk. Severus glared at him but was distracted as the child pulled away from him with a blush covering his face."M'sorry, sir. I shouldn't have done that."Severus tried for a grin at the boy. "It's fine, Harry." He coughed as he realized his reassurance would have to come. "I have come to understand that comfort is something I can provide to you should you need it."Severus watched as the child grinned at him, but to save himself from more sentimentality, he placed the child on his seat and took his own. "Lucius, have you anything more to discuss?"The man smirked as he stood from his chair. "No, not at all. I think I will just take my leave. Nice to have met you, Harry. Please take care. Severus, if I could have a moment?"Severus nodded and stood from the sitting area. "Harry, please wait here while Lucius and I speak. Afterwards, we can discuss some things regarding further lessons as well as this one."The boy nodded, allowing Severus to lead Lucius over to the floo. He set wards to hide them from sight and sound before turning to the waiting man. Lucius was smirking and looked to where the boy should be sitting. Severus sighed, leaning against the wall as he regarded the man.His partner crowded his space, his lips twisted into a mocking smile. "Oh, Severus, I can now see why you have begun to act with such predilection. Merlin, the child is adorable. Is that all it takes to get under the skin of one Severus Snape?"Severus growled, stabbing a finger in the man's chest. "Do not mock me, Lucius."The man's smirk turned into a genuine grin as he took Severus's hand from where it was stabbing him. Severus watched with confusion as the man took his hand and kissed it. Lucius smiled at him and gestured back to where the boy should be sitting. "I only jest, Severus. I am honestly taken with the way the child causes you to act. So protective and caring, and the way you reassure the child. Severus, I love you so much for doing this for the boy."The look of adoration on the man's face caused Severus to blush as he had yesterday but for a completely different reason. "Stop, Lucius."The man kissed him finally before pulling away. "Till later, love. Take care of the boy, though I know I have no need to tell you that."Severus was still flushing as the man took the floo out of his office. The man had wanted under his skin as well and had promptly succeeded. The man was a menace, but Severus looked forward to seeing him later to discuss this 'adoration' the man had.He came back to himself, taking down the wards he set for his conversation with Lucius. Severus returned to his seat with the boy to see the child happily sipping his tea, his legs slightly swaying where they could not reach the ground. Severus put another biscuit or two on the child's plate before going back to his own tea as he thought over what he would need to discuss with the child.He allowed the child to eat his treats before tapping the table to gain his attention. The boy's whole body seemed to draw up as he turned his full attention to Severus. Still, Severus noted the boy had not become apprehensive. "Harry, I would like to discuss some things I have noted that we should cover in our lessons. As I will try not to take much of your time, we will have to cover those in our lessons and then have you practice on your own. That is not to say that you cannot come to me for help. I will always be able to help you should you come to me."Severus noted the bright look in the boy's eyes as he nodded. "Yes, sir. I will practice as much as I can."Severus pointed at the boy with a stern frown. "That does not mean you can slacken in your studies. I expect you to do homework and study for exams."The boy seemed to hunch in on himself, his lip obviously between his teeth. Severus was about to prompt him when the child blew out a harsh breath as he released his lip. The child turned those fierce green eyes on him with determination, and Severus saw the same child that had scolded him. The courage must have come out of the child."I, uh, well, I don't know how to study, sir."Severus nodded, calling a pad to his hand where he could make a note of it on his list. Severus turned the list to the child and left him to pursue it. Severus noted the boy blushing furiously and smirked to himself. "Well, child, any questions?"The boy nodded. "Why... Uhm, not to say I am not grateful or anything, but what's wrong with how I use forks and stuff?"Severus snorted. "Indeed, you may not be aware, but there is a proper way to hold utensils."Severus conjured some cutlery and demonstrated for the boy. He handed the child the same pieces and had the child show him his understanding. Severus knew it would be awkward for a while though the child would undoubtedly try until he succeeded. "Good, Harry. I think that is enough for today. I will send you along with some sheets to practice your writing. We will meet again tomorrow during our free fourth periods to discuss more. Still, I think this was a very productive first meeting."The boy grinned, and Severus gestured the boy to the door. Severus walked the child to the door and followed him with his eyes as the boy walked down the corridor. He was almost to the end of the hall when he turned and smiled back at Severus. "Bye, Professor. See you tomorrow."Severus looked blankly at the child as he waved before fleeing from the corridor. Severus shook himself from the stupor before closing himself back in his office.HarryHarry had spent all his free time that week practising on his ability to write with a quill. When he wasn't doing that, he was doing homework and taking time out with Ron to play these new games he had learned called Gobstones and Exploding Snap. The other boys in their dorm also played, and Harry found Neville's quiet presence rather likeable when compared with Seamus's boisterous attitude. Dean was mostly normal, though he seemed to like football and knew a lot less about the wizarding world than Neville and Ron.The five of them had spent meals together as well as with Ron's older brothers Fred and George, who to Harry seemed to be a little barmy. They loved playing pranks, and Harry had even seen them attempt one on his Professor. They hadn't succeeded and had ended up in detention with Filch, but they were still funny.Harry was having a better time at mealtimes, even if the weird way his Professor showed him to use his fork and knife sometimes made his wrists feel funny. By Friday at lunch, Harry could eat at a reasonable pace with the new movements and had also been able to eat more. Harry grinned at his Professor as a treat hovered onto his plate, but the man wasn't looking at him.Ron elbowed him and gestured to the doors. "We have to go, Harry. Flying class is this afternoon."Harry's eyes widened. He had forgotten about the extra class they would have this week. Maybe he needed to ask his Professor for help, or maybe he should just go to class like everyone else. Harry shouldn't rely on the man for everything, or the man would find him a burden.Harry followed Ron out of the room to the courtyard. Most of their year mates were already outside and in groups by their perspective houses. Harry and Ron joined the others from their dorm. Seamus and Ron immediately started to discuss Quidditch and their flying skills while Harry stayed near Neville, who seemed to be near panicking. Harry wasn't that nervous, not at all. He wouldn't give Malfoy the satisfaction because the boy seemed to be watching him with venom in his eyes.Madame Hooch arrived and had them all line up with some brooms. Harry looked to see the old broom he had stepped beside. It didn't look like the most stable of objects, but Ron seemed excited. Harry was sure if his friend was fine that Harry could also be just as brave and ignore his nervousness.They went through some exercises, and Harry was pleasantly surprised to find himself doing better than most. Using the broom almost seemed like second nature to him, and his success was noted admirably by Ron and with greater despise by Malfoy. They had just gotten to mounting when everything went wrong for Neville. The boy went flying through the air and fell from the broom onto the ground.Harry wanted to run to the boy, but Madame Hooch had them stay where they were while she went to Neville. The boy seemed to favour an arm, and Madame Hooch was already herding him off to the Matron. Harry was confused at to why should we leave them there, but he wasn't allowed to think long on that as Malfoy had gotten his hands on a familiar object.The blonde-haired boy smirked as the Slytherins gathered around him. "Well, guess, Longbottom must have forgotten this. Maybe if he had had it, he might have remembered to fall on his fat arse. Stupid squib."Many of the Slytherins were chuckling while Harry pushed through the crowd to get to the boy. "Hey, Malfoy, give that back."The Slytherin boy narrowed his eyes at him with a smirk. He took to the air, flicking the Remebrall in the air. "Or what, Potty? Gonna call the Professor and whine to him some more? You pathetic baby."Harry flushed as his anger flared. "I'm not some baby, Malfoy, and give it back or... or I will knock you off your broom."The other boy snorted, throwing his head back to laugh hauntingly. "Fat chance of that, Wee Baby Potty. No chance you come up here like a big boy when you could get the Professor to help you."Harry snarled as he took off on his broom, shooting for the other boy. Malfoy ducked out of the way with a less confident smirk. The boy was looking at Harry with barely concealed shock, and Harry found himself glaring at the other boy. "Give it here, Malfoy!"The blonde seemed to shake himself before glaring at Harry. "Go fetch, Potty."The Slytherin threw the Remembrall, and Harry had a moment where everything faded. His body took over chasing after the object, his body pushing him to go harder before he caught up with the ball and snatched it from the air. His excitement at the catch hit him then, and he looked at his somewhat prize in admiration.Harry shook himself from his internal celebration and landed with the rest of his class. Malfoy was there as well and was stalking toward him. Harry was startled from the feeling of success, realizing he might be in danger."Harry Potter!"Harry and the rest of the class were surprised to find Professor McGonagall stalking toward them, her severe expression on her face. Harry gulped and handed the Remembrall to his friend before going to meet her. The woman looked down at him, an odd look in her eyes as she gestured for him to go the way she had come.Harry ducked his head, keeping out of her reach as he went the way she directed. He couldn't stop from flinching as the woman put a hand to his shoulder. He didn't move as she settled her hand there to his shoulder and turned him in her direction.Harry kept his head ducked as he looked up at her, grasping onto his robes to keep from twining his hands. He wasn't in the presence of his Professor, but he knew the man was trying to keep him from doing it at all."Harry."Harry looked up to see his Head of House looking down at him, her face peculiarly blank. "I'm sorry, Professor. I know I shouldn't have done what I did, but Malfoy was going to break Neville's Remembrall. I couldn't let him."Harry was surprised to see Professor McGonagall waving him off. "Enough of that, Harry. I am sure you won't do it again. I wanted to speak to you about a proposition I have for you.""Proposition, ma'am?"She nodded and waved him forward. They started walking down to the dungeons, and Harry was shocked to see her leading him toward his Professor's classroom. Was she going to tell his Professor? Why would she tell him? Why?"I need Wood, Professor."Harry was floored and felt his breathing pick up in pace. Was she going to beat him with something? Was that why they had come to his Professor? But, his Professor... He wouldn't! Would he?"Ah, Professor McGonagall, and..."Harry looked up to see his Professor standing in the doorway. Harry's lip felt like it was in a lot of pain, and he could feel something running down his chin. His Professor stepped forward, shutting the door to his classroom and waving a hand at the door. Harry was surprised to find the man's eyes on his own as he glanced up from where he had ducked his head to hide what he realized was a bit lip.His Professor tsked, coming to his side. Harry stayed where he was as the man knelt in front of him and put a hand on his bleeding lip. The man was glaring at him sternly and pulling things from his robes. Harry saw the same potion he was given last time brought to his lip and smeared onto the cut. The man was just as gentle as usual though he did seem much more irritated than usual."What have I said about biting your lip, child?"Harry slumped, feeling dejected for causing his Professor to be upset with him. "To, well, not to, sir."The man nodded sharply before standing and placing his hand to his shoulder. "Now, why are you mutilating yourself, Harry?"Harry flushed, looking away from the man and woman. He had just noticed Professor McGonagall staring at them curiously. Harry was ashamed now that he thought of what he had done at flying class, and he was sure his Professor would be even more displeased. He really didn't want to tell the man about it, but he would never lie to his Professor. "I-I heard Professor McGonagall ask for Wood, sir. I was scared she was going to punish me, sir."The man still gripped his shoulders but was kneeling in front of him without the stern glare. He seemed to be trying to make his softer face, the one Harry knew meant he was trying to smile. Harry was unsure why the man would be doing that when he had been so naughty, but he wasn't unhappy to see the expression from the man."Harry, even if you had done something horrible, no one will ever hit you again. No one is allowed to punish you that way, and should anyone ever try, you will come to me so that I may deal with them. Do I make myself clear?"Harry nodded, ducking his head as he could feel his smile try to overtake him. His Professor really was the best person he had ever met, and the man was going to protect him from even other professors. "I will. Thank you, sir."The man nodded and gripped his arms, causing Harry to look to the man's eyes. "Why are you afraid of punishment, Harry?"Harry wanted to bite his lip, but he kept his eyes to his Professor's and kept himself from injuring what was just healed. He had to be brave and hope that this didn't make him any less his Professor's exception."I flew in class, sir."The man arched a brow. "Well, it is flying class, Harry. I see no reason to expect punishment if you were to be flying in class."Harry winced. "Well, we weren't. You see, Neville had fallen from his broom and gotten hurt. Madame Hooch took him to get healed, and well, he dropped the Remembrall he had gotten this morning. Malfoy picked it up and was insulting Neville. I told him to give it back, and he made fun of me some. Then he went into the air and taunted that I wouldn't get it back. I couldn't let him hurt it. Neville had really been taken with it, and well, I didn't want to look like a baby. So, I went into the air, and then Malfoy throw it. I went flying after it and caught it."Harry had tried to keep himself from making excuses. He knew he wasn't to make excuses. Harry was in the wrong, and his Professor didn't need to hear his whinging. He would even take whatever punishment the man dubbed if it meant Harry was still his exception."Severus, if I may?"Harry looked up to see his Head-of-House standing over them with a small smile on her face. The expression was odd coming from her, but Harry found himself smiling as well. "What is it, Minerva?""I didn't come here to have the boy get into trouble, Severus. I was asking for Wood because I would like to extend Harry a position as Seeker on our team.""He's a first-year! Are you mad?""Seeker?"Harry hadn't meant to speak at the same time as his Professor, but the man didn't seem to even notice him as he glared at his Head. She was smirking at his Professor. "I am aware of his year, but if you just saw him, Severus! The boy is a natural!"Harry was surprised at her words and felt a warm glow in his stomach. He was a natural at something, he was good at something. She wanted him to play Quidditch. Harry had never played on a team before, and he found the idea to make something close to excitement build within him.His Professor had stood and was towering over his Head while one hand remained on Harry's shoulder. "I don't care how much of a natural he is. He could be hurt, and he has only flown the once.""Severus, honestly, you sound like a mother hen. Hundreds of children fly before they reach Hogwarts, and Harry here is better than most of the fifth years I have seen. If you are so worried, we could always let him show you for himself."Harry perked up at that suggestion since it seemed he needed to convince his Professor he could fly. He really wanted to fly again, and his Head-of-House seemed to want to let him fly more. Harry couldn't wait to show Severus everything he could do, and then he could play Quidditch on a team."I could show you, sir. Please," he begged, turning his hopeful eyes to the man.His Professor seemed to soften at his look, and Harry was rewarded when the man seemed to sigh resigned. "Very well, I will finish this class and meet you with Oliver Wood at the pitch. I want to explain, no matter what the decision regarding your playing, Harry, we will have words on your exploits."Harry nodded, his excitement curbed by the prospect of what punishment may be in store. His Professor left them to settle his class. While the other students exited the class, Harry and Professor McGonagall waited by the door for his Professor and Oliver Wood.His Professor exited the room with a boy who must have been at least a fifth year. Harry could see from his robes that he was in Gryffindor, but Harry could admit he hadn't met very many upper years. The four of them walked down the corridor without another word.Harry followed his Professor up to the main floor and then out onto the grounds. He hadn't spent much time there yet, but it seemed to be pleasant and green still even in mid-September. They went past the castle to the Quidditch pitch, and Harry waited with the two Professors as the other boy, Oliver, went to a supply closet.The boy came back to them carrying two brooms. Harry was unsurprised to see them and took the one offered to him by the older boy. "Well, not sure why Professor McGonagall wants to demonstrate for Professor Snape, but I am up for seeing what you got, Potter."He was gestured to go on, and Harry took the command and took the broom between his legs. He pushed off and felt less nervous than the first time. It showed as he carefully went into the sky, but it only was a moment later that he understood he needed to show off if only slightly. He took off, doing small turns at first and then feeling more confident. He took a few dives and turned in the air with a happy yell."Potter!"Harry looked to see the other boy was in the air with him, and he could hardly contain the grin on his face. He smiled at the other boy, who looked shocked while grinning. "Well, it seems we might just have a seeker for this year, but Professor McGonagall asked me to let a snitch go.""Snitch?"Harry looked over to the boy's hand to see a fluttering golden ball with wings. It looked beautiful and kind of small, but Harry was already taken with the small orb. He wanted to feel it in his hand, but he assumed Oliver had something else planned. "I want you to catch this, Potter. This is the snitch, understand?"Harry nodded, and not a second later, Oliver had let the snitch go. Harry followed it with his eyes and darted after it on his broom. The snitch was already bobbing and weaving away from him, but Harry wanted to have it in his hand. He needed to show his Professor he was good enough to be on the team, that he wasn't some little baby.He went into a dive with the snitch before darting in an upward angle after the feisty ball. It was on that angle that he outstretched his hand and snatched the little ball in his hand. It stopped flapping its wings almost immediately and curled up back into a golden ball in his hand. He looked at it in surprise before whooping with joy. "I caught it! I caught it!"He dove down and landed in front of his Professor, and with another shout, he jumped into the man's body, throwing his arms around the man. Seconds later, the man relaxed and hugged him back before pushing him away slightly. "You did well, Harry."Harry felt his eyes tear up as the man praised him for his flying. He had done well, and he felt so proud and filled with happiness. He grinned up at the man, and his Professor's look softened. The look lasted a moment before the man looked past Harry to Professor McGonagall and Oliver Wood. "Minerva, will you give us a moment?"Harry looked back to see his Head smiling at him. His fellow housemate was looking confused and curious, but he seemed to be quick to move away with his Head-of-House. Harry looked back to his Professor, who quickly led him to the benches at the edge of the field.His Professor pushed onto the benches then knelt in front of him. "Harry, I want to discuss this with you before you make your decision as you are the only one who can."Harry nodded his head quickly, wanting to talk with the man as well if he could get his Professor's opinion. "Okay, Professor.""Good, now if you are to take this position offered to you, I want to be clear that will not negate the punishment for disobeying and acting out in class, understood?"Harry nodded, his gaze fierce. "Yes, of course, sir. I will take any punishment, I swear. I just... I really want to play."The man sighed, looking to the sky. "But why, Harry?"Harry clenched his hands, keeping from nervously wringing them. "I-I want to be good at something. I want to help the Gryffindor team and make friends. I-I just have never been good at anything. Never."His eyes had started to water near the end, and he stuffed the palms of his hands into them to stem the flow of his tears. His Professor tapped his shoulder and handed him one of his hankies, which Harry took to wipe his tears and blow his nose. He knew not to pass it back and stuffed it into his robe pocket."Thank you, sir."The man waved off the thanks and gestured to the pitch. "If this is what you want, Harry, of course, I believe you should do it, but only if you think it will really make you happy."Harry grinned as he thought of flying before focusing back on his Professor. "Yes, sir! It... it makes me feel so light, and when you told me I did good... well, I like that feeling, sir."His Professor sighed as he stood from where he was kneeling. Harry looked curiously up at the man only for him to offer him a hand. "I fear I will be losing the Quidditch Cup this year."Harry took the proffered hand while still looking curiously at the man. "What do you mean, sir?"They began to walk back to the two others. "I only speak of how I fear with you as Gryffindor's seeker that this year's Quidditch Cup is already secured in your favour.""Me, sir? I don't think I'm that brilliant."His Professor smirked as he gestured to where Harry had flown. "I am certain that you are, Harry."Harry paused, hearing more praise from the man, and before the man could stop him, he had thrown himself at the man again. His Professor caught him and hugged him to him. Harry was so happy to be embraced by the man that he decided to ignore the idea that he would be facing punishment. It seemed it didn't matter that he'd done wrong because his Professor still treated him as his exception.

Disclaimer: I took some sentences and ideas from the books for this portion. Just to let everyone know now. (before writing) Gonna be honest, went a little deep on this one, and learned something as I wrote. I was a tad surprised. I get why I shouldn't even write CP in my stories. Damn, odd seeing that now. (during writing) Wow, this is long and I went a little deep. Going to give fair warning on triggers for child abuse near the end. Nothing too graphic, but it's mentioned with some detail. (after writing)Chapter TenThe youngest player in a century... Harry blushed to the tips of his toes, his whole body warm warring between pride and embarrassment, as Ron and the twins talked about their chances this year. They were in high spirits, and Harry was feeling rather good himself. He had done something astonishing, and his Professor had said he was proud of him. Not much could ruin his mood.The one thing was Malfoy appearing behind him, Crabbe at his side. Harry could wonder as to where Goyle was, but the boy seemed less likely to follow Malfoy around after their first encounter. Malfoy sneered, his face looking white and pinched. "Well, Potty, when are you going back to being a Muggle? McGonagall looked ready to tear into your arse."Harry glared at the boy, but he could see from the behind where he stood that Harry's Professor was watching them with narrowed eyes. Harry was already in for it, lines for two days the man had said, every day this weekend he'd promised, and Harry didn't want to make that worse."You act pretty tough here on the ground, Malfoy. Especially with Crabbe at your back. Lot different than facing me yourself."The blonde-haired boy sneered, his hand going to his wand. "I can take you, Wee Baby Potty. Tonight, a wizard's duel. Wand only. What? Too Muggle to know what a Wizard's duel is, Potty? Do you need to ask the Professor for help?"Harry bristled at the taunts, but he was stopped from replying when Ron shoved to his feet. "Of course, he knows. I'm his second, whose yours?""Crabbe. Midnight in the trophy room that's always left unlocked. Oh, and Potty, do try not to tell the Professor. No one likes little whining babies."Harry could only watch as the boy stalked off, Crabbe following behind. "What does Malfoy mean by mentioning the Professor all the time, Harry?" Ron's question interrupted Harry's thoughts and was not a welcome interruption. Harry wasn't sure he was allowed to tell anyone Professor Snape helped him, and he was confident that Ron wouldn't take it well. He would just have to distract the boy. "Nevermind that, Ron. What even is a Wizard's duel? Why do I need a second?"Ron's eyes flew wide, but he didn't make any taunts about Harry's lack of knowledge. That made Harry feel a little better. "Harry, mate, a wizard's duel is just what as it sounds. You shoot hexes and curses at your enemy, and if one of you dies, your second steps in your place.""Dies! Ron, are you bloody mad!"The red-headed boy put his hands up. "Come on, Harry, I wouldn't put you into danger. Most that will happen is the two of you shoot sparks at each other. It isn't like either of you know any spells."Harry sighed, raking a hand through his hair. He felt like this was something his Professor would want to know about, but he also knew that Malfoy was right. No one liked a whining baby, and if Harry told the man about the duel, he would be worse than a baby, he would be a rat. Harry couldn't keep going to his Professor for such small things, or the man would think him weak and a baby."Excuse me."Harry turned to see Hermione Granger standing behind them. She looked to be carrying her own shelf of books, and her face was pinched with irritation."Can't a person eat in peace in this place?"Harry felt the same at this point. Hadn't they been interrupted enough today?"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying...""Bet you could," Ron sniped.Harry elbowed his friend, not liking the look his words brought to the girl's face. She seemed a lot less sure of herself now, and Harry could see the slight trembling in her arms. "You really shouldn't go wandering around the castle at night. Think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you are bound to be. It would really be rather selfish of you."Harry felt it would be even more selfish of him if he were to tell his Professor. He didn't like the guilt the girl brought out in him, so he glared at her. "And it's really none of your business," Harry snapped at the girl."Good-bye," Ron pronounced before turning back to his meal.Harry agreed with the boy's words and turned his back on the girl, hoping she didn't feel terrible. He didn't want to be mean to anyone, but the girl needed to mind her business. This was no concern of hers, and if she kept on, she'd make him feel guilty enough to tell his Professor everything Harry had done wrong. Harry couldn't have that happen, not after he already got in trouble for the day.SnapeSomething was definitely going on with Harry, but Severus decided to allow the child to deal with it on his own. The boy was not an invalid, and Severus was no Nurse-maid. If the boy needed his help, he would seek him out.Severus's Friday night was looking a lot better than his day had been, even if seeing the excited look on Harry's face had made him feel a degree of happiness. Lucius was set on them having a date night, but as Severus was needed for his duties at Hogwarts, they were going to have it in his quarters. Severus had even forgone food at dinner so that he may eat with Lucius.Severus made his way to his quarters and was unsurprised to see the man was already there, a meal prepared and the record player set to some sort of muggle music. Severus rolled his eyes as his partner smirked in his direction, but he allowed that to fade into a light smile as he took his seat. Lucius joined him, fire-whisky in hand, and Severus found his own tumbler of the liquid waiting on him by his plate. Severus raised his glass at the man before draining it in the one go."Well, are we having a go of getting sloshed or was your day just that good?"Lucius already sounded more inebriated than usual, his usual proper tones fading. Severus smirked at the man and called the bottle to him, pouring himself another. "Let me catch up while I inform you, hm?"The man nodded, sipping at his own drink. "Please, go on, Sev."Severus rolled his eyes at the nickname, allowing it while the man was so... disarmed. It was as attractive to Severus as the way Lucius was smitten with Severus's Harry persona, or so Lucius had dubbed it. The two of them were a pair, falling for each other's least guarded personas."The first-years had flying class today.""What did the little ankle-biters do?"Severus let himself snort in an undignified manner. "Ah, only two blighters deigned to cause a ruckus.""Two? Well, if you are so exhausted, one was Harry."Severus nodded, taking another sip of his alcohol. "The other was Draco, of course. He had stolen something from the Longbottom boy, a weak-willed child, and then taunted Harry. The little hero that he is, he jumps onto a broom for the first time and saves the object in a fifty-foot dive, at least that is how McGonagall tells it.""Fifty feet on his first go... A Potter he is."Severus snarled. "Do not remind me."Lucius looked surprised. "Is that what has you so bent out of shape, Severus? We already know the boy could be less like James Potter than any random child on the street."Severus sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "You are right. That's not what has me so tense. The boy is going to be the Seeker.""AS A FIRST-YEAR? Are they mad?"Severus shook his head and allowed it to collapse into his hands in his frustration. "They aren't. Merlin, he's brilliant on a broom, Lucius. Minerva had the boy demonstrate for me, and you should have seen how he moved. I wanted so terribly to yank him from the air, but his face... Lucius, I have never seen the boy so relaxed. It was like he was a part of the broom itself the way it responded to him. He did this on a Cleansweep, Lucius, and now, he will be the youngest Seeker in a century."Severus was surprised to hear his partner laughing and turned from his resigned position to glare at the man. "I'm sorry, Severus, truly. It's just... You get so worked up just to fawn over the boy. He has you wrapped around his tiny finger. Merlin, you let him convince you to let him on the Quidditch team. Did you even punish the boy for his actions in class?"Severus blushed, thinking of his lame attempt to be stern that afternoon, telling the child he would be doing lines for the next two days. "He has detention for the next two days with me. Filch is taking Draco."Lucius sighed. "Yes, Draco. Still into trouble, still acting out, but what am I to do? What does he want from me, Severus?"Severus sighed as well because he knew he could not answer that for his friend. Draco wanted what every little boy wanted, his family to be together and whole, and sadly, that could not be the case. His parents had already moved on, and Draco was unable to accept it. Severus knew Lucius knew that already, so there really was nothing Severus could provide as an insight. It might be better if the boy spent some time with his mother to see how pleased she was with her new beau."I have nothing more to offer on the subject, though I gather the time with his mother may help matters. It may be best to leave it up to Narcissa for now, Lucius."The blonde nodded and downed the rest of his glass. "Pass me the bottle, love."Severus rolled his eyes at the pet name and conjured water into his partner's glass. "I think we have had enough, 'love.' I think it's time we had dinner."Lucius groaned but began sipping the water and taking bites of his food. Severus smirked in the man's direction before following his lead. They finished after some time and retired to the bedroom. Severus was sure they wouldn't be disturbed for the night and trusted his wards to alert him to the needs of his students.HarryThere had been a gigantic three-headed dog, huge and monstrous, a-and... It had almost eaten them all. Harry had nearly gotten all four of them killed or at least caught out of their beds, and why? Because he didn't want to look like a baby...Now, he looked stupid, letting Malfoy lead him out of bounds in the middle of the night, almost getting caught by Filch. Why did he let the boy get under his skin so terribly? It wasn't as if Harry was an idiot... Well, maybe now he should reconsider how he saw himself. He had to be an idiot because, here, he was out of bed again in the middle of the night, standing in front of his Professor's office door.Harry was going to tattle on himself because he still felt guilty, and the guilt was eating away at him, not letting him sleep. Ron and Neville had already fallen asleep, but Harry had just stayed flat on his bed, dreading his thoughts but being unable to stop them. How could he have been so stupid?Harry raised his hand and knocked on his Professor's door. He waited, knowing it was late but hoping that just maybe the man was in his office, but that was an even dumber thought. Why would the man spend his night in his office? Why would he even come to the door for Harry? Harry had acted like a git. A stupid, selfish git, just like Hermione had said."Harry?"Harry glanced, from where he was wringing his hands, to see his Professor coming from farther down the corridor. Harry snatched his hands apart, stuffing them into his robe pockets. His teeth scraped over his lip one last time before letting go. "Professor."The man's eyebrow was tilted at an angle, and his arms were crossed over his chest, and even though Harry knew that meant he wanted an answer, he just couldn't get the words out this time. His gaze dropped to look at the slippers the man had gotten him last weekend, and the guilt ate at him some more for having woken the man. Why did he feel the need to burden his Professor so much? The man must hate him, or at least find him irritating."Come."Harry looked up from under his fringe in confusion as the man gestured for him to go in the direction he arrived. Harry stepped past the man, keeping his distance, but that was for no reason as the man grabbed his shoulder and gently steered him to a door down the corridor. His Professor opened the door after whispering the password and led Harry to a couch just inside past the entryway.Harry was unceremoniously pushed onto the couch, his robe magicked away onto a coat rack. The blanket from behind the sofa snaked its way around his shoulders, bringing his attention to his shaking body. He clasped his hands in the soft fabric and tightened it around his body as he curled his legs up to his chest and pulled himself into a ball. His breathing, which he noted was running fast, slowed as the seconds ticked away."Better?"Harry looked up to find his Professor seated in an armchair directly across from him, a cup of tea in his hands. Harry looked down to see another waiting for him on the table between them and reached for it. He didn't check before taking a sip, knowing the man would have made it perfect. The small drink warmed him inside, but his mind still felt racing with guilt and thoughts."Are you able to discuss what brought you here, or should this wait till morning?"Harry's eyes shot up to his Professor's in shock. "Let me wait?"His Professor cocked an eyebrow. "You hardly seem able to form a coherent sentence. If time is what you need, I am agreeable to give it. However, you will stay in these quarters if all you are going to do is have another panic attack."Harry's eyes felt misty, and his hands started shaking. His Professor shot a spell at his cup, and Harry watched as the liquid stopped from spilling. He flashed a small smile to the man before looking back to the drink that awaited him. "Stay here?""If that is what you need," the man pronounced slowly.Harry felt too insecure about looking up, but the offer to stay had seemed precisely what he needed. Well, it wasn't an offer exactly, more of a threat, but the idea of being so close to his Professor made him feel safe. Harry wanted to feel safe and less like a burden and less guilty and less stupid... He should just tell the man the truth."I was outta bed."Harry heard the man snort and glanced up to see him smirking. "I can see that."Harry flushed, digging his fingers into the blanket. "B'fore this, sir. Malfoy wanted to duel at midnight. It was just supposed to be Ron and me going, but Hermione and Neville got locked out of Common Room cos the Fat Lady had left for something else."Harry cut himself off as tears started to fall. He jammed his palms into his eyes and huffed, exasperated with himself for crying when he was the one at fault. Harry should have never gone in the first place. He was so stupid, and now, he was crying like some baby."What happened at the duel, Harry?"Harry's eyes found his Professor's, and the man's face betrayed none of his feelings. "Nothing, sir. I-I was tricked by Malfoy. Filch was there instead, and well, we ran off. We were on the third floor, and then we hid behind this door when Filch got too close. But... There was this giant monster, and it was right there behind us, and... Sir, could we have died? I-I think we could have."Harry cut himself off with his own sobs, and his breathing was heavier than it had been as he tried to choke down on his tears. He felt a dip in the couch before he was pulled to the chest of his Professor. Harry let go of the blanket and grasped onto the man, burying his face in his Professors chest as he sobbed.He could have gotten them all killed, and all because of some stupid rivalry with Draco bloody Malfoy. He would never do something like this again. He couldn't take it if he got someone hurt. He would be bloody stupid to let his pride get to him like this again, and it hadn't even meant anything. No one would have even seen the duel, no one would have cared about some first years firing off tickling jinxes at each other."I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I won't do it again, I promise. Please, sir, I'm sorry."Harry found himself babbling apologies as his sobs lessened enough for words, but he was hushed quickly by his Professor as the man patted him on the back. Harry was soothed by the man's calm presence and the comforting hug enough that he found his tears ending and his breathing slowing. In the next second, he fell into sleep, allowing the tiredness he had been fighting to take him.Harry blinked as he looked up at the stone ceiling above him. His eyes were blurry, and he couldn't feel his glasses on his face. He didn't remember taking them off, but they were obviously missing. He sat up, looking around in confusion as he saw he was on a couch in someone's sitting room.No, not someone, his Professor's sitting room. Had he really slept there last night? He remembered crying and being hugged, and then... Well, he must have fallen asleep.Harry spotted his glasses on the end table and put them on so he could see better. He looked around, seeing a kitchenette behind him as well as a small table and chairs. In front of him was a fireplace with a fire warming him as Harry took in his Professors rooms. Bookshelves were lining the walls, and he followed them to a desk in the corner of the room, a desk where his Professor sat.Harry blushed as he stood up, coming around the sofa to where his Professor had sat, glancing at some parchment on his desk. Harry stood by the desk, waiting for the man to say anything at all, but he was left waiting for what might have been three minutes. The man glanced up at him and gestured to a chair placed by the man's desk, facing... The chair faced the corner, and Harry felt his stomach sink to his feet.Time-out... His Professor was going to put him in time-out, but that was a babies punishment. Harry wasn't a baby, even if he kept acting like one with all his whinging. He could take a real punishment, he would just have to explain."Sir, I can take a thrashing, promise. I can take anything, really. I know I keep crying, but I promise, I'm not a baby. I can even take the cane, really, sir."His Professor stood and lifted Harry from his feet. Harry tensed in fear, but all that happened was the man placing him on the chair. Harry turned to argue again, but he was met with the man turning his head to face the wall. Harry sighed, his shoulders sinking in resignation. He would just have to face a babies punishment until the man let him up, then he could convince him he was tough enough."You will sit there for twelve minutes, barring any need for the facilities. We will then discuss what you did wrong, and all will be forgiven. I will not hear any more about you being hit, Mr Potter. Have I made myself clear?"Harry felt shocked. This was all the punishment he was going to get. He couldn't let himself get off so easy. "Sir, this isn't enough. I-I did something awful."His Professor sighed. "We will discuss after your time is up."Harry nodded, his shoulders slumped. His Professor thought he was too weak to get a real punishment. No one besides babies got time-outs, and they weren't even a punishment. All Harry could do was sit here and think about everything he had done... Was that the point? Was he supposed to sit here and think about how much he screwed up? That did kind of seem like a punishment, but not one that Harry had ever had.Did ordinary people get punished like this? Fre... People like him, well, they got the belt or the cane or whatever else suited Uncle Vernon, but was that all wrong? Was that why his Professor kept from hitting him even when he got into so much trouble. Maybe he should listen to his Professor, the man seemed to always be right."Okay, you may turn your chair around, Harry."Harry did as the man said and faced his Professor. The man was seated at his desk and had his hands steepled to his lips. Harry felt himself shiver just a bit at the stern look, but he knew he deserved that and more. "I-I'm sorry, sir.""What are you sorry for, Harry?"Harry blanked. Didn't the man remember, or was this also part of the punishment? "Uhm, well, I'm sorry for being so stupid and selfish...""Stop. You will stop berating yourself, in your mind or here while we speak. You are just to state what you did wrong and understand it was a mistake. We are all humans, we all make mistakes. We are not infallible. You will only tell me where your actions went wrong, and then we will move on with our day."Harry's eyebrows disappeared into his hairline, but he continued as his Professor prompted. "I snuck out after curfew. I ran from a teacher when I was going to be caught. Uhm, I went to the third-floor corridor. I let Malfoy get under my skin and trick me. Uh, I think that's all, Professor."The man nodded. "Yes, because if you hadn't come to me, that would have been your last offence. When something bothers you, or you think your actions made lead to trouble, I want you to come to me, Harry. Preferably, before you scar yourself for life, which I am sure is the case now."Harry smiled weakly at the man, but his Professor was also giving his trying for smiling face. "I'm sorry again, sir, but I don't think time-out is enough. I could have gotten Ron killed."His Professor sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Who accepted the duel, Harry?""What?""I just want to know, who was it that said you would be at the duel?"Harry felt his hands want to wring nervously. "Well, Ron, sir, but I agreed.""Now, Mr Weasley was the one to accept, what was his position in this duel?"Harry flushed. "My second, sir.""And he gave himself this position as I assume you had no idea what even consisted of duelling in the magical world. Correct?"Harry nodded, lightly scraping his teeth over his lip. "Yessir, but Ron isn't the only one.""No. You are right. I am also trying to explain that Mr Weasley made his own choices to be there with you.""What about Neville and Hermione?"His Professor smirked. "Did you force them to come with you? I doubt Ms Granger would allow such a thing, though I can see where Longbottom would not have the gall to disagree."Harry glared at the man, his temper riled. "Neville chose to come with us because he couldn't get inside, but he's not as cowardly as you always say. He's a Gryffindor too, and he's my friend."His Professor didn't lose his smirk. "So you agree, he can make his own decisions? What a surprise. Everyone there made the decision to come along, knowing it was not where you were meant to be."Harry flushed, realizing his Professor had tricked him, and he couldn't even argue it because he was the one that said so. His Professor was right. He had made mistakes just like everyone else. But, that didn't mean a baby's punishment was all he deserved. "Sir, I still think I deserve a harsher punishment."His Professor stood, grasping his shoulder as he knelt before him. "Harry, the punishment I gave you was enough. Let me ask you, do you think what you did was wrong?"Harry nodded, almost outraged the man would ask. "Of course, sir."The man smirked. "Would you do it again?"Harry shook his head, fiercely. "No, of course, not. I couldn't do that again."The man almost smiled. "Then you have gotten all the punishment you need. You learned your lesson."Harry was still confused. "But, sir, punishment is supposed to hurt?"Harry found himself pulled against the man, the man hugging him to his chest. "No, Harry it is not. Punishments are meant to teach you that you had done wrong, not to hurt you. Pain is not a tool to use on children, no matter the circumstances."Harry was so confused, but he grasped onto his Professor and tried to understand what the man said. If what the man said was true, then every punishment he had ever received was wrong. Was everything from the Dursley's wrong?Severus"Harry, have you finished your lines?"The small child looked up from where he was writing his lines in his office. Saturday's lines were already at his desk, but Severus had not even counted them to verify the child had done the two-hundred set. The child had argued for more punishment the same day. There was no possible way he would have shirked even a letter."I have about ten more to go, sir. Should I finish up soon?"Severus felt the need to tell the boy about his meeting with his caseworker, but he had not gotten up the courage to explain to him after the weekend they had experienced. She was coming by before dinner, and it was only twenty minutes until she and Lucius were due to arrive. It was now or never, and Severus would hate to blindside the child."Finish up and then join me."The child nodded and began writing away with his quill. The work he had put into his writing showed in his lines. The boy was a hard worker who gave all his effort. Severus watched from his desk as the boy finished the ten or so lines. The child brought the lines to his desk, and Severus made a cursory pursual of the page before dropping it to settle with the other."Good job, Harry. Thank you for putting in so much effort."The boy smiled, and Severus took the lull in conversation to lead them to their usual conjured chairs. Severus called for tea and biscuits for the boy, being answered with the requested items nearly immediately. He began making the boy's tea and serving his plate before handing both to the wide-eyed boy. Today was supposed to be their lesson time, but Severus found himself dreading the meeting too much to put in the effort.Severus was unsure how the boy would react to the news, but there was no reason to prevaricate. "Harry, I need to inform you that in a manner of minutes, we will be meeting with your caseworker. She is a kind lady, and she wished to discuss with you some details that you already told me. Would you be alright with that?"Severus watched the boy's hands as the trembled slightly, but the boy seemed mostly together if a little too pale. The child nodded and went back to his tea. Severus could understand avoiding a topic until absolutely necessary, so he didn't badger the boy for more.It was nearing five when the floo sounded. Lucius stepped through and settled at the entrance with his hand extended. The witch that followed took the hand and allowed him to steady her as she exited. She had black hair, arched eyebrows, and a face that reminded Severus of someone he had long thought in Azkaban. Severus knew Bellatrix to be in Azkaban, and he knew this woman as well, she was the eldest sister, Andromeda."Thank you, Lucius. Honestly, I have such trouble with the floo, as does my daughter."Lucius was smiling, though Severus noted it was his half-genuine smile, and he kissed the witch's hand before gesturing her forward. "Please, take a seat, Andromeda."The witch's smile reached her eyes when she caught sight of Harry, and she made her way to him, stopping short of his personal space and extending her hand slowly. "Hello, you must be Harry. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Andromeda Tonks, but you may call me Andromada."Severus was pleased with her introduction and mannerisms. They were slow and cautious, allowing Harry to process them. The child took the hand after a moment with a shy smile. "Hullo, I'm Harry. It's nice to meet you."Severus would have to teach the boy more about wizarding customs as he was supposed to have stood for that introduction. Still, there was something to say about how polite the child was. He would discuss the topic on a later, less taxing date."Thank you for meeting with me, Harry. Would you mind terribly if I took a seat with you and your Professor?"Severus watched the child shake his head, his eyes wide. Severus knew the boy was surprised to be asked, but in this matter, the boy's opinion trumped all others. Severus stood as Andromeda approached. She smiled kindly as she grasped his hand. "Hello, again, Professor Snape. I am glad this is the first time we have seen each other this year. I assume we will have less frequent meetings now that Nymphadora has graduated."Severus smirked. "One can hope, Madame Tonks."She rolled her eyes. "Andromeda. But, yes, I hope we never have to attend to matters like these, but I am always glad to help."Severus frowned, nodding at the mention of his other cases. If only she knew how different this one was for him, she might understand how much he never wanted to see another case. "Thank you for coming. Please, take a seat."She and Lucius both sat in the other armchairs, Lucius closest to Severus and Andromeda closer to Harry. Severus retook his seat and kept his attention on the boy as Andromeda began. "Now, Harry, I wanted to ask you some questions and see how you are doing, would that be alright?"The child nodded, his hands tapping restlessly on his pant legs. Severus appreciated it more than the hand wringing or lip biting, so he would allow it for now. "I think that's fine, ma'am, uh, Andromeda.""Good, first, can I ask you about where you slept when you were living with the Dursleys?"The boy gulped. "Well, the, uh, cupboard under the stairs, ma'am."Severus noted Andromeda's professionalism. "Thank you, Harry, and how long did you sleep there?"The boy's lips received a small scrape of his teeth. "Since I can remember. Then when the letters started coming, they got worried they were being spied on and moved me to my cousin's second bedroom.""Second bedroom?" Lucius asked.The child nodded, sitting up slightly. "Yeah, I mean, yes, sir. He had a room where he put all his broken toys. They were still there when I slept there."Lucius frowned. "I see. Sorry for the interruption, Andromeda."She nodded slightly, turning back to Harry. "And did you have any toys, Harry?"The boy frowned, his eyes staring at his feet. "There were these toy soldiers I kept from the bin. They were broken because Dudley thought them rubbish, but I kept them."Andromeda nodded, and Severus focused more on the child and keeping his face as schooled as possible. "Was there anything else they gave you that was Dudley's?"The boy nodded, his eyes not resurfacing. "Yeah, his old cast-offs. They were massive on me, cos I'm small. I got new clothes now though, but I have to keep from losing them the Professor said. Dudleys were always getting lost or turned to rags. They were always stained too, and I never could keep them clean while I did my chores.""Chores, Harry?"Harry's eyes resurfaced his eyes less dim. "Yeah, I did all the chores. I cooked, cleaned, weeded the garden, did the washing, and anything else they could think of.""And your cousin, what did he do?"The child looked back down at that question, his hands slightly twining. Severus tapped the child's hands and was rewarded with a small smile from the boy. Severus tried to smile back, to reassure the child, and Harry faced Andromeda again, his eyes meeting hers. "He didn't do anything, ma'am. He was their precious son, and they loved him."Severus was happy she didn't ask the boy if his guardians loved him. He could do without seeing how broken that would make the boy. It was hard enough seeing the light dimmed in his eyes. "Now, what happened if you did something wrong, like not finish your chores?"Harry winced, rubbing his stomach in what might have been remembered pain. "They liked to lock me in my cupboard without food as punishment. The worst punishments were if I did magic.""And did you do magic a lot?"Severus watched as the boy shrugged. "Sometimes. Once When Dudley chased me at school, I ended up on the roof. Another time a teacher was rude, and I turned her hair blue. Then there was this snake at the zoo that my cousin and his friend were bothering. I let it out of its cage, and Dudley got scared.""And what did the Dursleys do to you?"The boy's eyes filled with tears, and his lip was pierced by his teeth. Severus tapped the boy's chin and watched blood drip from the wound as the child let the lip slip from his teeth. "They beat me. They would hurt me, and Professor Snape says punishments shouldn't hurt. He says they should make you understand you had done wrong. I never knew I was doing anything wrong. All I knew was I had to stop being freakish, but I didn't know how. Honest. I didn't."Severus gathered the boy close, hugging the child to him as he sobbed. He glared at Andromeda, watching as her eyes filled with sympathy. He did not feel any kinder at her apologetic face. How could he when the boy sobbed so heavily against him? "I think that's enough."She nodded. "I agree. Would you like to settle him somewhere then we should speak?"Severus nodded, gathering the boy into his arms as he stood. He carried the child to the entrance to his quarters and didn't bother whispering as he said the password. Now that the child knew where he lived, there was no reason to hide how he could get to him if he needed him.He sat on his couch, placing the boy beside him. The child was wiping at his eyes with his robe sleeve, and Severus tsked as he handed the child one of his handkerchiefs. "Use that, child."The boy nodded, wiping his eyes and blowing his nose before pocketing the cloth. "Thank you, Professor. I feel a little better now."Severus nodded and gestured to the couch. "Lie back."The boy looked confused as he followed the order. Severus spelt the boy's robe to the rack and his shoes to the front door before taking the blanket from the back of the sofa and draping it over the boy. "Sir?"Severus smirked as he tucked the child in, making sure he was secure. "I think you would do better with a rest while I go speak to the caseworker. If I find out you have gotten up in my absence, well... you will regret it."The boy giggled before nodding. "I'll rest, promise."Severus nodded as well before sweeping out of his quarters. He shook his head, trying to understand what had just happened and who he was before returning to the other two. It was for nothing as his head still spun when he stepped back into his office."Ah, Severus, thank you for joining us."Severus sneered at Lucius and turned his black gaze to Andromeda. His emotions felt uncontrollable and fierce as he thought of how she had made him cry. "Just what were you doing? You already saw the Pensieve memories, you heard already what he told me."She nodded. "I know that, Severus. I was only here to confirm the details and see how the boy was mentally. In comparison to the first time, he was much better emotionally. His words didn't speak of brainwashing, and their actions were not defended by him. In only two weeks, the boy has managed to at least question everything they said, but you know that because you are the one helping him, aren't you?"Severus rolled his eyes. "Well, of course, I am. The boy needs my help."She was smiling now, her grin stretching across her face. "Yes, he does seem to favour your help. So, I suppose the hunt for a guardian is finished?"Severus snorted. "Hardly. The child will only want to be with me until we find him a proper guardian.""Proper guardian? Severus, you do realize that anyone can be a guardian, anyone can take in a child, including you?"Severus sneered at her sentimentality, her optimistic views. "The boy does not deserve me as a guardian. He deserves someone better."Lucius decided now was the time to bud into the conversation, "Does he think that?"Severus glared. "He doesn't know any better, as you can tell from his past guardians.""I disagree. It seemed, he was very sure who was correcting the mistakes of his past guardians," Lucius said with a smirk.Severus growled low in irritation. "He deserves someone better than me. Why don't you understand that?"Andromeda stepped forward her face masked, but her tone gentle, "He deserves to be happy, and if his happiness is found with you, would you turn him away?"Severus glared at the gall of the woman. "I would never turn him away."She nodded. "So it is settled. You will take Harry's guardianship until such a time as he considers someone else. If that time never comes, well, I suppose you are stuck with him. Agreed?""Agreed," Lucius said grinning.Severus sighed, nodding his head in resignation. "Very well."Andromeda smiled kindly, patting his arm. "I will have the paperwork drawn up and signed by the correct officials by next weekend."Severus could feel nothing but nerves eating away at him.

Hey, you guys and gals. I am so sorry for going away for so long. I think I am back to normal now or at least getting there. I plan to write a chapter a week for each of the current stories. If you have any ideas or comments, please make them. Also, it is easier for me to respond if you leave a name or email. I try to respond to each comment, but alas, I cannot for guests. So, if you want me to respond, leave an email or something. Thanks.Severus looked down as the boy unwrapped the parcel carefully, almost reverently. He had no idea why he was wasting his period of instruction with the boy with such... niceties, but the boy had so little. Severus had watched the child at practices this week, in secret as was necessary, seeming almost restricted to the use of the Cleansweeps that Hogwarts allowed by those without their own broom. The boy was stunted by such outdated models, and it was utterly unacceptable how crude the models were, how faulty the safety charms could become.While there were other models, the top of the line Nimbus 2000 had praises rang onto it enough that even someone such as Severus Snape knew it to be the fastest... and safest broom. It had all of the speed and the added charms necessary for an overly small eleven-year-old going head-to-head with overly broad older years. He had, of course, had Lucius assist in procuring the broom from Diagon Alley as Severus would rather eat a pickled-toad then be seen in that store. It had been a rather gruelling success as he put up with the behaviour in which Lucius nearly fawned over him and his new-found "soft-heart," as if Severus could be described as such.Now here he was, heat on the back of his neck and the tips of his ears as he watched Harry open the gift with such reverence. It should have been a crime to look so mystified by a gift with his name on it, but Severus was well aware of how it was only the second gift the boy had ever received in his life. The boy was almost too gentle as he opened the parcel to find the broom before him.Severus felt a smug satisfaction as the boy's eyes went wide with wonder and his hands wandered across the broom as tenderly as if the broom was sentient. Satisfaction bled into panic as the child began to weep. Severus was moving on instinct around the table separating them and found himself kneeling in front of the folded inward child. The boy's hands were stuffed over his face, his chest was heaving, and his shoulders trembled, and all Severus could do was put cautious hands on the child's shoulders.It seemed his reactions were fruitful as he found the tiny blur of a child forcefully knocking him to the ground in a desperate grip. Severus found his arms already around the child and bringing him closer to where he could cup the head digging into his neck. There were words he could hear now between hitched breaths."Thank y-you. N-Never... had a g-gift b-before. T-too much."Severus did not bother to contain his scoff, rising with the child still clutched to him. He moved them to the other side of his desk, settling into his own chair and allowing the boy his mobility to move as he pleased. Said child found it his purpose to settle onto his lap and tuck himself tighter to Severus's person. Severus silently rolled his eyes and stroked the messy mop of hair on the child's head."It was not too much for both your safety and your ability. I had to even stop Professor McGonagall from doing the same because I assure you now, Potter, I will not have you on some over-ridden, failing old broom while you twirl about hundreds of meters in the air. Do I make myself clear?"The boy nodded, his eyes bright with wonder and tears. "Yes, sir. Thank you so much. It's so wicked and amazing, and I don't even know how I am going to repay you..."Severus sighed, tapping the boy's twirling hands. "Enough of that, Harry. Not only will you not be repaying me, but you will also not ask to ever again, are we clear?""But sir!"The boy flinched, tightening himself inward. Severus knew it was from fear at his response to the boy's raised voice. Severus tried his usual reassuring expression on and tilted the child's ducked head to level his gaze. The boy looked at him from under his fringe before relaxing once again. "I need no payment for giving you a gift, Harry. Take it as the gift it is as there will be plenty more in your future.""Uhm, yes, sir."Severus smirked, pulling a handkerchief from his robe pocket and handing it to the child. The boy brightened visibly and took the token to wipe his face. Severus discarded it with a spell and moved to set the boy onto his feet. Once the child was once again calm and standing, Severus took over leading him back around to the broom. The boy looked just as awed but more restrained as he looked over the broom without touching it."Go on, Harry. Our instruction can wait for another time. I suggest you take Mr Weasley with you to the pitch and familiarize yourself with the broom."The boy's eyes went wide as saucers. "W-we aren't going to learn anything new?"Severus smirked. "Not today. I do believe it better you are comfortable on the broom as you have practice tonight, do you not?"Harry nodded his head, his eyes still wide. "And you think I should go now?"Severus rolled his eyes, taking the broom from the desk and sticking it into the boy's arms. "Go, Potter. Take Weasley and be safe. I will know if you disobey a single order I have stated. Understood?"The boy gulped, nodding his head avidly. "Yes, sir. Thank you again."Severus nodded at the thanks and steered the child from the office. He shut the door once he saw the boy making his way from the dungeons. Severus's head was lit with a warmth that he could not explain, and his chest was tight. Maybe he was coming down with something and should visit Poppy.HarryHarry tried not to rush down the corridors as he attempted to make his way to where Ron was waiting for him in the Great Hall. He peeked around the doors to see Ron waiting at the Gryffindor table. Harry grinned, yelling Ron's name to get his attention and then motioning him out into the hall. The redhead looked bewildered at the display from Harry, but Harry could hardly contain his excitement.His Professor had gotten him a gift, and not just any present, but a Nimbus 2000, the fastest broom on the market. The man had given him the highest chance at winning over his own house, and that had to mean something. His Professor really cared about him so much that he would risk losing the Quidditch Cup, which was huge from what Oliver had told him. Oliver had said that Professor Snape being present for his demonstration was weird and then had explained there was a legendary rivalry between the two houses, especially between His Professor and Professor McGonagall.Harry was grinning like a loon he was sure because Ron was looking at him like he'd gone mad. His best friend settled a hand on his shoulder and then seemed to see what was in that hand. The other boy's eyes went wide, and his mouth dropped open. "Bloody Hell, mate! That's a Nimbus 2000!"Harry nodded avidly, not caring as his glasses went askew. He just righted them with the other hand and proudly held up the broom for Ron's closer inspection. "Yep, I just got it as a gift from... Professor McGonagall."His best friend's eyes seemed to try to grow larger at that information, but his hands were already rubbing over the broom handle in reverie. Harry smiled as his friend seemed just as in awe of the broom as he had been, minus the tears, of course. Harry felt a touch of embarrassment creep over him from crying over the gift, but he was sure that his Professor would never mention it."Mate, this is the best broom on the market!"Harry's eyes caught the hint of blonde hair before a scoff interrupted his response. "And what do we have here? A broom, Baby Potty. What will the Professor say?"Ron was the first to react, his face reddening and his body whirling to face Malfoy and Crabbe. Harry felt his own face reddening, and his eyes were glaring at the blonde. The boy looked jealous and pinched as he looked to the broom in his hands, and Harry was ashamed to feel a bit of vindictive satisfaction."It's not just any old broom, Malfoy. It's a Nimbus 2000. What is it you said you had at home, Malfoy? A Comet 260?" Ron looked to Harry with a satisfied grin. "The Comet looks flashy, but they're not in the same league as the Nimbus."Malfoy sneered at Ron, and Harry took another step forward to be level with Ron. "Save it, Malfoy. I didn't come to argue with you. Come on, Ron."Ron looked stunned, and Malfoy seemed just as offended at being cut off. Harry found an arm pushing him back when he went to step past Malfoy. "Where are you off to, Baby Potty? Going to go spend your time grovelling at the Professor's feet for a morsel of attention and affection? We all know the muggles think you're useless. He will too. Who wouldn't see that about you, Pitiful Potty?"Ron snapped to look at Harry, who felt like a chasm had opened in his chest. Malfoy was right, of course. There was no way his Professor would keep seeing him as his exception. Harry was useless and a fre... he wasn't wanted. He knew that as well as he knew his own name. He was kidding himself thinking the broom wasn't the beginning of the end and that the Professor would see he was a burden now and stop talking to him and hate him..."Harry! Mate, breathe!"Harry flinched at the arms on his shoulders, looking up to see Ron hovering over him. He tried to understand why his chest hurt and why his throat burned all the way to his lungs. Malfoy and Crabbe were still there, though if he looked around Ron, he could see the diminutive form of Professor Flitwick. Why was his chest hurting him, and why wasn't he breathing?"Mate, you're scaring me! Professor!"Harry was made to sit on the ground, and Professor Flitwick was now in from of him. The small Professor waved his wand, and Harry felt his eyes water as air rushed into him. The spell must have kept at it because Harry found himself not in control as the air came into and out of his body. Tears of embarrassment and fear rushed to his eyes, and he tried to duck his face into his knees."Mr Potter, please wait for a moment. I need to be assured of your recovery. Then might I suggest the hospital wing?"Harry nodded shakily but bringing his eyes back up made him able to see the ugly look on Malfoy's face. Ron must have noticed because he turned to Malfoy and told him to bugger off. Malfoy sniggered as he sauntered off, but he wasn't free before Professor Flitwick assigned him detention that night with him. Harry only felt slightly appeased by that as it didn't stop Malfoy from spreading the word about his breakdown.Now that Malfoy had left, the tears came harder down his face and his breathing, left in his control, hitched. He wanted... why was he doing this to himself? Why was he attaching himself to his Professor when he knew it could all be taken away in a moment? Was Malfoy right and he was desperate for even a small amount of affection? He didn't want Malfoy to be right about any of it.Professor Flitwick was still watching him as he cast a spell that caused a piece of parchment to enchant into a bird. Harry was distracted by it for a moment before it was sent flying. Harry wasn't sure for the need of that paper bird, but he did find himself wanting to know the spell. The small Professor looked down at him with concern, and Harry felt his chest tighten in shame."I-i'm fine, Professor. Honest. You can go."Professor Flitwick looked unconvinced and didn't move, and Harry could see Ron's mouth was opening and closing like a fish out of water. Hary assumed it was due to him sobbing and barely breathing correctly. He wanted to stop and get himself together, but his heart hurt within his chest. Harry wanted his Professor, but he was also unsure if that would give him the comfort he needed.Why did he let Malfoy get to him? His past experiences with adults reminded him how easy everything Malfoy said could come true and curled into his knees finally. He blocked out the conversation Ron was trying to have with him or the returned words Professor Flitwick was saying."Why are you two blithering idiots just standing there? Move, Weasley. Honestly, Filius, you have the emotional intelligence of a toad."Harry didn't dare look up as his Professor insulted both his friend and one of his friendlier Professors. Usually, he would have stuck up for them both, but he wondered if that would make his Professor hate him faster. The fear made him swallow the words and sob into his knees harder."You're upsetting him you, git!"Harry's head shot up to see Ron scowling at his Professor and looking red in the face. His Professor's jaw was clenched, and Harry could see the contained fury in his stance. "I am doing nothing of the sort, Weasley. Either be silent or make haste away from me before you find yourself scrubbing pus and cauldrons with me for a month."Harry was surprised at the controlled response from his Professor, but as the man turned to him and his face melted into concern, he found his answer. The man was civil for his sake, or as considerate as Professor Snape could be. Harry grasped at his pant legs to keep his hands from twining and resisted the urge to hide back in his knees.His Professor stepped closer, gesturing his hand around their space. Harry watched with wonder as the world outside of their immediate vicinity blurred and muffled. The man must have cast wards around them, and Harry felt immediately grateful for the consideration.His Professor moved closer, dropping into a kneel to be more level with him. Though the man still towered over him, Harry only managed to feel comfort from the presence. The man was trying at his smile, the genuine smile in his eyes as usual, and Harry felt something in his chest unfurl.The man glanced back to Professor Flitwick, who stood slightly back with a confused Ron. "What happened?"The smaller Professor cleared his throat, glancing at the broom in Ron's hands. "Two of your students had stopped Mr Potter and Weasley. They were exchanging words, and from what I heard near the end, Mr Malfoy was insulting Mr Potter. The child was having a panic attack before I could get to them to separate the two groups."Harry clenched his teeth as his Professors jaw set. He so badly wanted to bite his lip, but he didn't want to anger the man more. His Professor turned his head to the other side to glance at Ron, and the redhead jumped at the barked question."Uhm, well, sir, Malfoy stopped us to make fun of Harry. I tried to defend him, and then Harry told us both to stop and for us to leave. Malfoy stopped Harry from leaving and then told him that... Uhm, well, he said the Professor would figure out what his muggle family already did."His Professor glanced at him, his eyes curious, but Harry found himself ducking back into his knees at the look. "And, what did he say 'this Professor' would find out?"Harry heard the enunciation on the words and shivered at the tone. His Professor sounded angry, and there was a bite to his words. Harry was doomed."Malfoy said that his muggle family thought him useless, sir. But that's rubbish! No one could think that about Harry, sir! It's completely mad!"Harry was surprised to hear a hum of agreement from his Professor. "You are correct, Weasley. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not that children need to have 'use' to be valued by those who genuinely care for them. Wouldn't you agree, Filius?"Harry peeked up to see three sets of eyes on him. Ron looked as shocked as he had for the past few minutes, Professor Flitwick looked mostly concerned as well as pleased, and his Professor had that soft regard still aimed only at him. He noticed distantly that he was no longer crying and that his chest no longer hurt."Of course not, Severus. Children are a gift, not tools."His Professor caught his eyes, and Harry needed no more words to understand what his Professor was saying to him. Harry rushed from his position and flung himself into his Professor's arms. He wasn't going to allow himself to cry anymore, but he did bury his face into the man's neck and curled tightly into the man. His Professor just held him closer, rubbing down his back soothingly."Harry, we have spoken before about this, but I want to be clear, nothing you do will push me away or make me see you in any other light. Whatever Malfoy manages to snipe at you, I want you to try to remember this. I promise to be there for you no matter what, Harry."Harry nodded against the man, hearing his friend's gasp and Professor Flitwick's squeak. "A verbal response, Mr Potter.""I understand, sir. Honest."The man tapped his head, and Harry pulled his face from the man's neck without being told. His Professor was gazing down at him with a dark look on his face, but Harry knew he wasn't angry with him. The man stood, placing Harry onto his own feet, and crossed his arms across his chest. Harry fisted his robes in his hands and looked up at the man through his fringe."Why haven't you told me that Malfoy has continued to bully you, Harry? Especially when it seems to be about me specifically?"Harry blushed, looking to where Ron was staring between him and his Professor with wide eyes. "I, uhm, well... I would just be proving him right, sir. He calls me Baby Potty because I always run crying to you like some toddler. It's embarrassing."The man sighed, gesturing for Harry to remain silent. "It seems we have more to discuss then I previously thought. Filius, I assume Malfoy's detention has been arranged?"The smaller Professor jumped and began nodding. "Yes, yes, of course, Severus. Should I cancel it?"His Professor seemed to consider it before looking down again at Harry. "No, take the boy, but remind him of what I warned last time. He will know of the threat easily. Also, kindly impart to him, that if this incident gets around the school, his own dirty laundry is bound to be aired."Harry's eyebrows shot into his hairline. "Sir!"His Professor rolled his eyes, looking at him with his eyebrow cocked. "How I decide to punish my students is no concern of yours, Harry? Bullying is a serious matter, Mr Potter. Though I know your Gryffindor sensibilities make you think you must become a martyr, I am not allowing some boy to continue to grow into some bullying fool. He has shown he cannot be reasoned with, so another manner of solutions must be used. Understood, Harry?"Harry sighed before nodding his acceptance. He understood what the Professor was saying. Dudley had been the same, and there was no reasoning with him either, and Harry wasn't going to forgive either of them since it was plain they weren't sorry. Sometimes the only way to resolve a bully is to be mean back, but Harry didn't like being mean. It seemed his Professor had no such hangups."Alright. So you understand now that you will come to me if he bullies you again?""Sir, I really don't want to come off as some tattle-tale baby."The man knelt once more, his hands resting on his shoulders. "Harry, child, did you like how Malfoy's words made you feel about me?"Harry flinched at the question. "Well, no, sir. They made me feel horrible."The man nodded, his hand just barely wiping at the tear tracks on his cheeks. "Do you think I enjoy seeing you so upset?"Harry shook his head, knowing from the man's anger and response so far that the man was agitated that Harry was being bullied by Malfoy. "No, sir. I know how much you hate it too.""Then, can you please do us both this one favour and allow me to protect you from any more harm? I don't like seeing you so upset, Harry, and I want to make it better. Can you let me do that, Harry?"Harry scraped his lip with his teeth before nodding to the man. "Yes, sir. I can do it."The man nodded as he finished wiping at the tear tracks on Harry's face. "Excellent, Harry. Good boy."Harry felt his chest open and get stuffed with warmth at the words. His face lit up at the praise, and he dove in for one more hug with the man. Harry pulled himself away and looked back to see Ron looking at him oddly. Harry understood now would be the best time to explain things to Ron before he got more confused or angry that Harry was keeping something from him.His Professor took down his spells and gestured for the doors leading outside. "I think I will walk you and Mr Weasley to the pitch, if you don't mind, Harry?"Harry nodded and followed his Professor out toward the pitch with Ron carrying his new broom. Harry glanced over at his friend, the other boy already staring at him. Harry gulped and stuck his hands into his pockets to keep from twining them. "Uhm, I guess you probably have questions."Ron snorted, gesturing toward Harry's Professor. "You think, mate?"Harry winced. "Yeah, I'm sorry for not telling you sooner, Ron. I just... it's been a lot."It was Ron's turn to wince. "Well, I don't know everything, but I guess what Malfoy was saying about the muggles..."Harry nodded. "They, well, they never really wanted me in the first place. Professor Snape, he well, found out that day Malfoy hurt me."Ron gulped, his face white. "So, do they? You know?"Harry turned his face away, catching the briefest look of reassurance from his Professor. "They have, yeah. I, uhm, didn't think anyone would care, but Professor Snape did."Ron glanced at the Professor's back, his face unreadable. "Well, I'm glad he helped you, Harry. Uhm, do you know where you will be going this summer? You can't go back there."Harry grimaced. "I, uhm... not sure. Some lady from the ministry is sorting it, and well, Professor Snape said he would take guardianship until I found someone I want to live with."Ron's eyebrows shot into his hairline, but he managed not to scream his usual, 'bloody hell.' "Are you serious? That's... well, after earlier... Uhm, I think it will be good for you, mate."Harry grinned at his friend and looked to where his Professor seemed to manage to give them some semblance of privacy. The man had seemed tense, but Harry noticed that it was gone now. Maybe Harry wasn't the only one insecure about how people would react to his Professor being his guardian.They had made it to the pitch, and Harry allowed Ron to have the first ride on the broom while he lingered next to his Professor without actually invading his space. The man settled a hand onto his shoulder, and the comfort made Harry's heartbeat slow to normal. "I think Mr Weasley will be a good confidant, but please inform him this information is to stay with him, Harry?"Harry nodded, smiling up at the man. His Professor's softened look was returned to him, and Harry had to resist hugging the man once again.SeverusMinerva had entered his quarters looking as smug as the cat she changed into, but Severus did not have to wait long for the answer as to why. "The Pensieve, Severus. You won't want to miss this."Severus called the object to the coffee table and allowed her to deposit the memory into the Pensieve. Severus was gestured forward, and he sat on the sofa before falling into the memory...Minerva stood on the doorstep of Pentunia's perfect house in her perfect neighbourhood with Andromeda taking up the task of knocking on the door. The door was thrown open by a large muggle man, Vernon if Severus recalled correctly. "What you freaks want?" the boisterous man shouted.Severus felt his anger matching Minerva's as the woman moved forward to confront the man. Andromeda placed a calming hand on Minerva's arm and turned a sickenly sweet, false smile onto the man. "We are here to discuss your nephew Harry Potter, Mr Dursley. May we come in?"The man's nostrils flared at the mention of the boy, but he made this grunting huff and motioning the two witches into the home. "Well, hurry up then. No need for the neighbours to see you lot."Andromeda moved inside the home with grace while Minerva stomped her way past the man with a well-placed boot onto his foot. Satisfaction at the small slight filled him as he was now going into the house. The decoration was so conformed and precise that Severus found his eyes burning. He looked away from the eyesore and found himself in the parlour with the lout of a son and Petunia."What are you doing here?" she shrieked.Minerva smirked, but Andromeda was the one to answer her, "We are here to discuss your nephew. Please, do sit down."Petunia looked like she had swallowed a whole lemon, though that was hardly a change from her usual expression. "What of him? We sent him to that freaky school after you sent that oaf to scare us."Minerva seemed to barely be holding onto her sanity and decorum as she pointed at the woman. "You have no right to disrespect Hagrid after what you have done. We should have done more than threaten you after all you have done to Harry.""What has the freak been saying? He's a liar and a dirty little monster."Andromeda barely managed to stop Minerva from launching herself at the woman, and Severus had to swallow his disappointment. She would have most assuredly deserved it. The husband came in then and stomped his foot, his face red with anger. "I will not have it! We have done nothing to that disrespectful little twit! Now, leave my home at once!"Andromeda looked at him cooly, and Severus was reminded of Bellatrix once again. "We will leave after you have signed these papers in my hand. If you choose not to, well, we have plenty of evidence to go to the muggle authorities and run your name in the mud as well as have you charged for child abuse. Your choice, of course."Severus grinned wolfishly at the reactions on their faces. They would sign, no doubt, and after gathering themselves back with their anger, they both took a pen to the document. Andromeda smiled and took the papers away from them."Well, woman, what was it?"Andromeda glared at the man, her mask slipping. "You have signed away your guardianship of Mr Potter. He will not be coming back, and any stipend you have received for his care will be stopped. In the future, should Mr Potter wish it, your compensation will be back paid to him, and charges may be brought.""Charges! For what? The little freak had it coming, always doing those freaky little tricks of his! He needed the discipline to beat it out of him!"Andromeda's eyes flashed with something before she turned to Minerva. "I will be outside, Minerva. Please be brief."Minerva smirked and nodded as she took out her wand. Severus watched with bated breath as she cast the spell, and it washed over the two older Dursley's. She turned on the younger and cast a different spell, a much more forgiving one in Severus's opinion. "You will probably already be experiencing the effects, the dread and fear and sadness. That is what Lily and James must feel from the beyond from your actions, and now, you too will feel as if at any moment, no matter what you do, someone will come and treat your son the way you have treated Harry. It will never go away, not for at least eleven years, and if at that point the message hasn't sunk in, it will continue until you manage remorse for what you have done.""What have you done to my Duddykins!"Minerva sneered at Petunia and gestured to the child. "His is a much more forgiving spell, but it makes him feel like every time he bullies someone, the feelings they exhibit will be transferred to him tenfold. If the child ever grows out of being a bully, the spell will end. If not, oh well.""You can't... You bloody bint!""It appears as if I already have, Mr Dursley."Severus came out of the memory with a grin on his face. His whole chest felt vindictively pleased, and he found himself hugging the elder witch. She made a surprised noise before hugging him back. Severus could only smirk as he released her and moved to his liquor cabinet. "A drink, Minerva."She was smiling and looking at him oddly as she nodded. "Yes, a toast."He smirked, pouring them each three fingers of his single malt. He handed the woman a tumbler and held up his own. They tapped each other's glass and turned them up.Severus was waiting with Harry in his office. It was Sunday, and they expected to meet with Andromeda that afternoon. They had already had a tea service brought in for them both, and Severus had already given the boy a number of biscuits to keep him entertained.It had just reached the hour when the woman came stumbling from the floo. Unlike her daughter, she did not collapse, but it was a near thing. Harry looked sympathetic, but Severus was smirking at the woman as she righted herself and strode toward the nearly permanent sitting area taking up the corner of his office.She was already getting down to business, laying out the documents with the Dursley's signature. There were already colourful notes marking the place for his and Harry's signature, but he had already informed the witch they would speak to the child first. Severus leaned toward the boy, causing the bright, green eyes to stare at him curiously. "Harry, you are aware that Andromeda has been working on getting the paperwork for you to have new guardians, correct?""Yes, sir. Is that what that is?"Severus nodded, gesturing to the signatures of the child's previous... minders. "Yes, child, those signatures there are form the Dursley's. As was already agreed when we began this, I will take your guardianship."The boy was obvious in his attempts not to bite his lip or twine his hands, and Severus waited patiently for the child to express himself. "Until we find someone else?"Severus could hear the boy's hesitance to remind him. It was clear the child had no one else he wanted to be his guardian, and while Severus was always saying he wasn't fit, he could not begrudge the child he cared for so deeply. "Well, child... I would like to extend a new deal."The boy's head perked up, and his eyes were alight again. Severus found the change calming to his weathered emotions. "A new deal, sir?"Severus moved to kneel in front of the boy. "Yes, Harry, a better deal. Over this month, it has been made clear to me that I was mistaken. I would like to offer to be your guardian indefinitely, or until you find you have had your fill of me. I am not an easy man, but I... I find myself wanting to help you by filling that role."The child's eyes were wide, and Severus felt the creeping anxiety coming over him. "Really, sir? Y-you want me?"Severus cleared his throat, obviously affected by the biscuits from earlier. They must have been dry, he reasoned. "For as long as you will have me, child."The boy flung himself into his arms, and Severus caught the child fully prepared for one of his limpet attacks. The boy, for once, was not sobbing in earnest, but there were definite tears were clinging to Severus's neck. The boy was thanking him, and Severus found himself combing through the boy's hair with his hand and shushing him.Severus had so far avoided looking in her direction, but he caught a glimpse of the witch in the chair beside him dabbing at her own eyes. Severus gritted his teeth against the need to clear his throat again. "Harry, might we sign the papers?"The child nodded but did not pull away from him. Severus chuckled, grabbing the boy and carrying him with him back to his own chair. He settled with the child on his lap but faced the boy toward the table holding the documents. Severus helped the boy to sign in the correct place before doing so himself. It was only after they had finished that the parchment rolled itself up and disappeared with a pop.The child in Severus's arms looked fascinated, and Severus found himself smirking down at the boy. Andromeda stood, and Severus gave her his brief attention. She smiled at him and offered a hand. Severus tried to feel embarrassed he was not following wizarding customs, but he was too... happy, he supposed.He shook her hand and allowed her to see herself out while he took to rubbing the back of the drifting child in his arms. The child he was the guardian of... he was the guardian of Harry Potter.

Harry Potter was highly unusual in many ways. For one, he didn't have to live in an orphanage, despite his parents being dead. For another, he really wanted to go to school, but he had to focus on earning his keep with the Dursleys: Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and his cousin Dudley. And he also happened to be a chimney sweep's apprentice.It was nearly dawn and Harry and his fellow climbing boys -and girl- were sleeping black. The cloth and sacks Master Edwin used to capture fallen soot draped over them, bodies shaking nonetheless from the cold seeping through the dirty cellar floor.Harry untangled himself from the heap of bodies first. Treading with care as not to wake anyone up, feet unsteady. He shivered. Wrapping his jacket around him for warmth, eyeing his friends with their rising and falling chest with a glint in his eyes. Tempting. So very tempting. But Master Edwin would come soon. Shrill voice jolting them awake and among the hustle, Harry would miss the opportunity to wash up, be late and suffer Edwin's wrath.What would Uncle Vernon and Petunia say when Master Edwin complained to them? Hurtling Harry back home and declaring him useless? Uncle Vernon wouldn't take his small physique as an excuse and no doubt throw him out. Screaming that no sissy boy deserved to be housed under his roof.He shuddered again, not cold, and when he was ready enough the lofty steps of Edwin's boots echoed behind the door. A momentary fumbling of keys and the wood hurled open, smashing against the wall with enough force to wake the others.And if that wasn't enough to stir the heaviest of sleepers (namely Oliver), the ragged shouting certainly was."Wake up, 'ye useless clotpoles!" Erwin boomed, snatching the blanket from over the boys. Draping the fabric and sacks over his soot-stained jacket while the five others withdrew with sharp flinches. Sleep induced and tripping over their feet in the result, they scurried off to the morning routine none were too pleased to share.For once, Harry -thirteen year old and not showing it- watched. Sight a blur of shapes and shadow. Running wild like the thoughts in his mind. Another day. Another sun. And Harry Potter has woken once more to the void in his chest eating away the heart he prided himself to have. Oldest he might be, to these children… a brother that they didn't have and the hope they would better be without… but the light from life was starting to dim for him after all. Oliver… John… Little Joe and the only girl, Marie-Lue... All lined beside him, ash and dark and clothes that were never meant to be theirs.Another clench of his heart and Harry faced forward.Edwin, scowling in the face Edwin, took them in with a grunt. Eyes narrowed. Searching for a toe out of line, as the thought bolted in their minds , "That all of you?" he asked, adjusting his cap.Harry nodded, curtly, and only because the rest did not. Clenching his jaw hard enough to rattle his teeth, Harry allowed the man his petty fun of spitting at their feet. The hands clasped behind his back jarring his skin, drawing angry gashes over the ones already lining them."A'ight. Off with you all, then," Edwin said, banging his cane against the metal rails. Making small Marie, only six, flinch and duck her head. Launching for Harry's hand when Edwin marched up the steps, head ducking to get past the door when his hat almost fell off.Despite himself, despite what he told everyone in the business, Harry squeezed back. Hard flesh against Marie's soft, innocent skin snagged by two weeks of labour. Tears already forming, trails against red skin. The disappointment Harry had to learn to leave behind as not to stagger. As to win. As to earn his keep.As to earn the love that he now doubted he deserved to have.London, on this summer morning, wore fresh fog. Cold fumes, dirty and from the mines and factories. The ones the adults assumed as progress and what the children assumed as early death. Harry squeezed again, against better logic. Meeting Oliver's eye -the second oldest- and shaking his head. Oliver raised a brow and turned back around. And left. Left him all alone. Fending for the girl, whimpering and weak when he wasn't anything more.When the cart, a feverish clutter of dark shapes appeared, Harry tugged, pulling the girl closer. Eyes lifting from under the cap to eye Edwin, now smoking Edwin, and leant down to her ear."Marie," he whispered, sharp as winter snow, "You have to stop crying."Marie sniffled, shaking her head. She lifted an arm, wiped her eyes. Fast and fuming, though not scared, "I want to go home. To mummy and daddy."Mummy and daddy. The words winked from the corners of nightmarish nights. Glinting in the stars that sang of them, rose for others. Harry risked another look. This time Oliver nodded in his stead and Harry sighed. When he stopped walking, Mary slammed against his back.Her fingers lifted. Cradling the bridge of her nose, now tutted red and glanced up. Slow and trembling. The wind sweeping loose strands of black, once blond and no more the silk it used to be. Harry's hair wasn't much the same. Reddish-black now soothed dark and rough under the cap.Harry lifted a single finger to his lips, olive-skin and not from the soot, "We have to stop crying. Alright, Marie? Your-" he bit on his lips, blinking hard, "Your Mummy and Daddy aren't here... yet. So you must- you have to... you should be strong, yeah? You're a strong girl. Mummy and Daddy want little girls to be strong because everyone loves strong little girls," he whispered, standing up and tugging on her hand, walking faster to keep up.Marie-Lue sniffed. Wiping the soiled tears from her eyes -brown, doe eyes- and looked up when they stood in line to get on the carriage, "Will Mummy and Daddy love me when I'm strong?"Harry stared. Stared until Edwin was behind him. A hand smacking down on his neck, ripping off his cap and barking at his face. Smoke and spit coiling around Harry's nose. Taking most of the willpower Harry had to not scrunch.He bent down for his cap. Thanking Marie-Lue by lifting her into the cartridge for finding it, he jumped on. He took the seat at the very end for his tardiness and Marie-Lue cuddled to his side, rubbing her head against his chest. The others watched. Harry watched them back. Little Joe and Oliver... David and Rory and Harry number two (or as they called him Mums, since he never talked), all small and searching. All learnt of affection here, or the lack thereof. Not to look for it. Not to search for it. Keep the yearning inside you, where it won't come to harm you.And still, yearn you would.The carriage jolted. The children jolted with them. The driver's whips sliced the air, earning a shrill whine from the 'beast' that didn't look like it could pull anything but its own weight."Harry," Marie whispered, only six and so small, "Will they come back for me if I'm strong?"A family walked in his mind. Happy and laughing. A woman wearing dark blue robes and a man wearing a suit, smart and something Harry saw on the glass one freezing Christmas two years back. Getting a shaky look before the tailor chased him back, screaming about how he would scare off customers. He only found him because Harry had left his soot in the snow. Betraying him in the ally where he lied, frozen and beaten with blood in his teeth.Bad Christmas. But he'd seen his parents there and begged to join them. In his mind, his mother black-haired and kind-eyed. His father red-haired and green-eyed and only because he once saw a heard of red-heads and their own father in town. Poor, not well off but happy all the same. Happy. And Harry would doubt Aunt Petunia in these instances. How poverty, while making those five children Happy, made Harry Potter's parents leave him on his Aunt's doorstep one summer night.One summer night thirteen years ago, and even now Aunt Petunia refused to say anymore.And Harry wouldn't either.He cleared his throat. The girl, only a girl, looked up and returned Harry's smile, though it didn't resemble the grimace on Harry's face, "We'll pray for it.""Every night?""Every night.""Will you teach me?"Harry paused and looked up. Oliver regarded him with narrow eyes and crossed brows. The look Harry had become better at ignoring over the years.And ignore he did."I will. I promise. We'll pray... we'll pray for a family."Marie nodded. Harder than necessary and held up a curled pinky finger, "And for food. Yummy food, like in the big town."Harry opened his mouth. David, eight years old, talked instead, "And clothes."Rory, ten and a half, "And a warm house!"Mums, who communicated with hands alone, clasped his hands and faked sleep, winking at them when the rest fell into soft laughter.Well, most of them anyway. Little Joe joined in, despite not having said anything But Oliver stood stern. Cocking his head when Edwin -bastard Edwin- twisted his head with nasty threats of no dinner. Took Harry and Marie-Lue with a look that promised far more and turned back to the front with a grunt.Harry heard the curse. But smiled at Marie. Only Marie. Taking her finger with his own and shook, a deal well made. An oath well earned, "I promise, Marie."And Marie grinned with hope Harry had lost. She hugged with strong arms. Warm and still alive, and her breath fell soft and steady while Harry watched her closed eyes. Tufting a strand away from her face, Harry leaned back on the wood. Pulling his jacket tighter around himself, against the summer wind that sang of winter. Of sleep. Of today.The today masked by tall, grey buildings that swam in hasty shapes. Tall and beautiful and alive. Parents and children and families that were warm and not some wind to jolt them out a dream that wasn't real. Just them, and warm fires and someone's presence to look forward to. Despite the cold. Despite the fog. And no matter what London or England could be, a family it would stay.He frowned.And then Harry prayed.London, for all it's worth, was less grime and more stares. And climbing down from the carriage in an unfamiliar neighbourhood was always foreign and strange. Edwin called them all identical. So did Harry, with the shapes and colours so familiar in his eyes that he needed someone to tell him which house was which when Edwin wasn't looking.Taking one large sheet over his shoulder, Edwin turned to the street. Cupping a hand over his mouth and shouting with a voice no longer raspy, "Soot- Oh, Sweep!" over and over until there were at least two people peeked through their blinds, their curtains closing just as quick when they caught sight of them.Edwin clearly didn't mind being at the receiving end of the glares from the residence. Or he was good at hiding it. Or that these particular glares weren't as bad, seeing as most the buildings here belonged to tradesmen and shopkeepers, judging by the signs that lined over the brick architecture."A'ight," Edwin turned to the line of children. Dropping a pale sheet over each of their arms, he swept a look over each of them as he passed, the only black eye on his face seizing up Harry when he stopped in front of him, "You come with me."And with a sharp jab to his chest, Harry followed. Not sparing a glance behind him, Harry squared shoulders. Throwing the worn sheet over his shoulder and stuttering to the sidewalk.Harry's feet shuffled on the cobblestone. Cold, due to the holes in the soles and the socks that thinned to strings. Edwin didn't look behind him. Grumbling now and again to a passerby, complaining about their dress or shoes or the riches they most likely possessed and Harry was once again reminded of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. They too took great pleasure in gossip and complaint, sneering at anyone who looked to be better off them in any detail. Gloating over the souls that were unfortunate enough to have the little they didn't. Though, Harry couldn't call their assets little. With their servant and three large bedrooms and the kitchen that never seemed to lack food, they certainly weren't poor. And taking in Harry at a young age and keeping him in the cupboard under the stairs and rarely feeding him could hardly diminish their wealth. Especially when Dudley's birthday gifts showed a visible accumulation over the years.Harry, called back from his daydream by bumping against Edwin's back, looked up. Ducking his head at Edwin's scowl, he shuffled his weight from one foot to the other. Nodding when Edwin barked at him to wait outside. His ears pricking at the sound of the bell, though his eyes did not falter from the cracked stone on the ground. Interesting stone it was. Cracked, dark and not ugly like Edwin. Harry leaned against the glass, crunching the pebbles with his toes.His breath swirled in a white mist over his mouth and nose. Unsteady. Breaking. And his fascination lasted the three minutes Edwin spent inside before he was dragged in. Arm burning even after Edwin let go.The shop, in question, was warm. Not the uncomfortable warm that lasted two rare days of summer. Or the chimneys he climbed with their suffocating heat. No, this warmth was tender. This warmth smelled sharp of herbs and teas and flowers he didn't know. Of medicines terrible and strange that reminded him of... well, he wasn't sure.But it smelled of home.Either way, Harry made sure to keep his head down. Made sure that his eyes, green and not to everyone's liking hid behind his cap. Stay out of sight. If you can't, stay silent. Be the next best thing and keep still. Mummys and Daddys only like quiet, obedient kids, don't you know Potter? Not some scrawny dark-skinned boy with knobbly knees. Harry nodded, reluctant. But the voice in his head disappeared all the same. Leaving behind a chuckle and a slap on his neck.Harry sputtered. And then met the eyes of the client.Black, piercing, angry. Dressed all in black and a not someone Harry would like to meet on a midnight traverse. And though Harry's eyes dropped the black shirt, the man's did not. Continuing to listen to Edwin with his eyes not lingering."We settled on the price, then?""I suppose it's an adequate amount, in return for your, ah deliverance," the man said, smooth but snide, and Harry's head lifted in surprise. Breath jerking because the man was still looking and it wasn't what Harry would consider in his favour.A moment of silence. Then, "This way, please. I had the chimney in the shop swept not a while ago. The same cannot be said for the one in my personal quarters and laboratory," and he led them around the brown oak counter to a door behind a shelf of jars and glass bottles. Opening the door that led a flight of stairs, shadow drawn and narrowed between two black walls.Edwin cleared his throat, making the man turn around. His shoulder-length black hair falling curtain around his face,"Eh, Mr Snape-""Professor Snape,"Edwin clenched his fist, "Of course. Professor Snape. Do you want another worker for the second chimney, or would this lad be of use?"For Professor Snape, the question must not have been an easy one. His brows knitted closer and the lean form hunched forward, long arms crossing over his chest.And then the Professor did something that made Harry stagger down a step.He kneeled to his height. Taking the arm that wasn't holding the brush and sheet. And with a touch that should not have been gentle, squeezed.It was in no way familial. Nor parental and no matter how much the scent of the shop swirled the man, Harry told himself it wasn't home.He wasn't home. But now, with his dark eyes soot-black and searching, Harry's breath did hitch and his heart fell into an unsteady run. Fast, uneven and to his dismay, something the professor noticed. How he knew, Harry couldn't say. But after that bony finger slithered to his wrist and pressed down, the professor knew.The arched brow complemented his features. With those sharp and high cheekbones, and the lingering suspicion that the professor wasn't just a professor bothered Harry. Not much, but enough to take another step back before he was cornered by Edwin. Snatching his wrist back, Harry rubbed the skin and faced away.Professor Snape, quick to let go and quicker in gaining back his decorum, stood up. He clasped his hands behind him, and with a look positively bored, faced Edwin, "He will suffice, assuming that your...climbing boys clean more than a chimney per day.""Oh, yes. Mark me words, five and six if their luck. The economy as it is… Need some income, you know, not that you yourself-"Professor Snape held out a hand. And Harry allowed himself to grin under his cap at the way Edwin's face morphed into surprise and then rage."Yes yes. Very drastic. God bless the Queen. Now," he then turned, resuming the rest of the climb, "If you'd follow me?"They complied. But the sneer that pulled on Edwin's lips couldn't mean he was pleased. Harry could almost read the man's mind, after spending four years with the man. Something between a scoff and a chuckle sounding from his lips when Edwin's voice echoed in his mind. Complaining in a rigid voice, stomping over and over his mechanical brush while cursing at every professor that came to be.He hid it, of course. Behind a cough and a grin bit back, just in time for Professor Snape to open the door (oak and dark) on the landing, giving way a large living area.And it was nothing like Harry imagined.A dark shadow followed Professor Snape. In the corner, in his heart. A shadow that sneered and scowled and growled like a beast and Harry assumed... well, it wasn't right to make assumptions. No. But with the warm chocolate walls, wooden tiles beneath multiple dark green carpets and furniture that was welcoming more than menacing, Harry could admit that his taste wasn't half bad. Sure, the space was small. With a chimney in the corner below layers of shelves and a long couch and single armchair, there wasn't much area left to the circular dining table and two chairs, as well as the kitchen area lining the opposite wall. All warm and colours of dull brown and green. Not wild, not snark but some comfort to his eyes nonetheless."You have a nice house," Harry said, soft, certain. Then immediately clamped a hand over his mouth when the man's head whirled around. Making dear Harry pinch the inside of his palm and avert his eyes.A slap on the back of the head was Edwin's -cruel and disgusting Edwin's- response. Along with a hiss in the ear to behave while he apologised to the Professor, hands clasped together in apology, back bent.Disgusting. And people thought the kid's kissed up to others.Professor Snape waved a dismissed hand, one hand still behind his back, "I do not mind. Now, I'm a rather busy man. Hence I ask you to be quick about it, Mr Edwin.""Yes yes. Of course," Edwin said, honeyed. Grabbing Harry around the cuff the next second and dragging him across the parlour to the well-furnished chimney. He kneeled down to his knees, bones groaning in protest. Grabbing hold of the metal long holder and removing it from the hearth. Then, he lifted up a hand and Harry passed him the white cloth. All the while the Professor sat in his armchair.And watched.Harry wasn't about to return the gesture. So while Professor Snape watched Edwin lay the cloth over the hearth, Harry watched the ornaments that lined over the mantelpiece. Particularly a single picture showing a younger Professor Snape and a woman, long-haired and beautiful and laughing along with the man, pointing at the person taking the picture.Edwin's voice rose him, and Harry was once more pushed forward. Stumbling and finding his support on the brick fireplace.Professor Snape watched.Professor Snape didn't say a word."Eh," Edwin cleared his throat, "Will you be here, Professor Snape?""Why yes. I find it impractical to leave children unsupervised, considerably so when dealing with... hazardous tasks.""I's keeping 'em supervised, Professor."Professor Snape's arched brow was nothing short of humiliating. Seizing Edwin in a mock question and doubt, "Whatever for?""...You're keeping him under lock and-"Professor Snape held out a hand and Harry indulged himself in another grin at the pale-faced Edwin. Almost liking the man who was now crossing his slender legs, pants pulling high enough to share a glimpse of his black socks, "I shall endeavour to be abundantly clear. I am keeping the boy under supervision so I keep up my honour as a responsible man with proper moral. You, Mr Edwin, have a charge of children needing to be taken care of, to my precise knowledge, and no time to waste. The boy will do fine, and my chimney is in no rush.""We always keep on the lookout, Professor Snape. We-""Are not in a shop your opinions are favoured, as I have made clear to every single sweeper to cross into my quarters. The boy alone, please. You may collect him in, hmm, on your way back from a neighbourhood that hasn't been cleaned just yesterday by another hoard of children."These things happen, Harry told himself. Running a hand down the shelf, brows disappearing in his blob of hair when his finger came back dust-free. Some others were quicker. Sweeping the neighbourhood clean and making them search for another. Making the children grin while Edwin got scolded by the tenants of the houses. But never was it as fun as this."Whatever... whatever shall the boy do, when done with 'em both?"Professor Snape rolled his eyes, "Ensnare me, Mr Edwin. Actually, no. Rather not. But I imagine that in an apothecary, there is enough work to humour a senile child. I am a busy man and having some additional aid would be much appreciated. Of course," he added, looking right into Edwin's eyes, a smirk twisting his lips, "You'll receive the payment necessary."In a twist of fate called 'money', Edwin's crooked back straightened and Harry didn't even have the time to be offended at the word 'senile' before a nasty crack came from his spine, making Harry wince and Professor Snape's mouth twitch. Black eyes glaring at Edwin's hand, which was shaking the Professor's vigorously."That's a deal if I've ever seen one," Edwin said with a toothless grin and only Harry noticed the Professor wiping his hand on a handkerchief after he stood up and led them both to the door. But Edwin turned around just before disappearing. Back arched and on his toes to peek above the Professor's shoulder, a finger jabbing the air rather sharply."An' don' forget to buff it, boy!"A muscle twitched near Harry's eye. And when the door closed, masking the last of their ceasing steps, Harry rolled his eyes. Most adults in his life treated him in the same sense as the Dursleys and Edwin. Stupid, ignorant, arrogant, nuisance, burden… And a couple more which were less mundane. But stating the obvious to his face always got Harry's blood pumping the worst of ways and anger was never slow to follow.So when a cough from behind him interrupted him from striping from his pants, anger and surprise found themselves equally alive.Professor Snape, already by the door, had his arms crossed. Scowl still in his face, though less at ease snapped, "What are you doing?" eyeing Harry's hands.Harry frowned, "Buffing it, sir?""What?""It's to go in nude, Professor," Harry explained, patiently, like he supposed the Professor did at school. But when the scowl deepened, he grinned. Likely not, "It's easier to clean that way. Less likely to get stuck."Professor Snape hummed while Harry got rid of the remainder of his clothes. Now a nasty pile beside the heath, Harry greeted the man with a mock salute before entering the hearth, heart already thumping wild. This was fine. He'd done this before. For years, since the day Uncle Vernon finally kicked him out of the house and Annabeth helped him pack his bag, tears in both their eyes, he'd done this before. No need to throw a tantrum now at the sight of the dark, narrow chute that could mean a possible death with a single wrong movement.No need at all.So Harry breathed. Readied himself by pulling up by the walls and climbed. Using his arms and legs, he hoisted himself up. His brush ridding the flue line of the black soot. Keeping his head down as to breath as little as the poisonous material into his lunges, body moving much like a caterpillar up the line.Little help that did, Harry sneered. Over the years he'd spent, climbing chimney after chimney, always panic and little fun, the soot would get to him sooner or later. Suffocating him in an alleyway where nobody cared.Little left to take his mind off things, Marie-Lue smiled at him in the darkness and their clasped fingers were close behind.And then, Harry prayed.Prayed for love. Prayed for a family.Prayed for a mother and a father and wouldn't a brother just be perfect? A little family away from the world, away from the soot that would care not because they had to because Harry was Harry and that was all he had to be.Under the cap, no one heard him cry.That was a harsh reality to live and when his head shot through the chute, another day alive, the wind bit at his cheeks and burned his lungs clean.A harsh reality. An unfair life but Harry was always complaining, wasn't he? And adults complained about their complaining and loved to remind them life wasn't a silver platter and he would have to live his way through it.There's always a fine line between living and surviving.Adults told him to live. Live in the only way he could: Survive.Harry wanted to live, as the sun dawned upon the roofs. Silver and pale but nothing short of a sight when the bricks and steel glinted in the light of a new day. Harry wanted to live as he slipped back down, having enough of the London city tops starting to bustle with life.Wanted to live when he was falling fast. Faster than he should have. Wanted to live when he regained his hold to cushion his fall, still fast but not fast enough to die.Even when the Professor's face, wild with concern, danced in his view before finally, he closed his eyes.Black as soot.Peaceful as the night.

When Harry woke up, his body ached and heat suffocated his throat. The warmth driving him senseless and afraid until a tug in his mind reminded him where he was -what had happened - yet immediately failing him when a hand, cold and comforting, landed on his forehead. Lean fingers drew his hair back and placed a cold, wet rag on his forehead. The water slid down his head, tickling his skin.The hand left, and Harry moaned. Trying to lift his head for a better view before he was pushed down, stern fingers lead him by the shoulders and Harry complied.Cold, hot, burning, freezing.He fought to stay awake while the voices around him danced - broken, angry. Snippets of words leaked through the cracks."...fever still up… tomorrow…""...can't… work… Have to take him…"One silky, the other very familiar. Not Uncle Vernon, but close enough that Harry whimpered. Shaking his head from side to side because no. Not Uncle Vernon. Not here. Not Uncle Vernon, please-Uncle Vernon snorted, sauntering closer to the presence that was already beside Harry. A shadow loomed over his frame before the hand intervened. The owner slid between the shadow, slender but not Aunt Petunia, strong but not Uncle Vernon.Stern and not afraid."...Tomorrow…. need to discuss… unlicensed…"And then, Uncle Vernon was gone. The floor shaking under his weight, the door slamming after him, rippling the water in the basin beside Harry's head - rhythmic, appeasing. Afterwards, the rag left and came back colder than before, lulling him to sleep -despite the fingers that pried the sheets from him, despite the cold, despite the whimpers. For at the end, the voice did speak to him."... sleep, Potter."And he did.The next time Harry woke, his eyes opened first. He blinked at the dark-wood ceiling. Hard. Then again, until the fog in his mind lifted and sleep was just as nauseating as the heat.But the heat wasn't here anymore, was it? Nor the cold that chilled his bones. Not anymore. He altered between freezing and burning, leaving him confused in a stranger's bed with clothes that slid down his thin frame.Harry pushed himself up - groggy and slow, but desperate to get out. He tried to untangle the sheets first -prying away the light green blanket with clumsy hands, he shook the material free, and stepped out.And then he fell.An arm caught him by the waist before he could faceplant on the wooden floor.The arm, or rather the owner of the arm, stood still. Ghost-quiet. Harry perked his ears, searching for a sound, but not even the man's rising chest emitted one. Swallowing tight, Harry craned his head. Lifting his eyes to see the Professor's face twisted with furious creases. The glare hardened, emphasized by the purple bags under his eyes."Are you as arrogant as you are stupid?" he spat.The collar of the shirt cut into Harry's skin, but Professor Snape didn't let go."Does the prospect of death excite you, Potter?"Well, most days. When the cellar floor was particularly cold or when Edwin's belt was as sharp as his tongue.Harry shook his head, casting his eyes away, "No, sir.""Does the idea of playing the martyr tempt you, Mr Potter? Or perhaps it's the glory of the hero that drives you to saunter out of bed as if you haven't suffered head trauma? Malnutrition and injured bones aren't even the worst of the problems you have!"Harry froze. His mouth hung open, ears deaf to the Professor's voice. While his lips moved, spitting words like poison, all Harry could think was that despite his looks and tone of voice, the Professor seemed… concerned."... bruised body and a sprained wrist! Not to mention the filth that coated your skin and hair! The blasted water turned ghastly black by the time you were in an acceptable-""Did I worry you, sir? Were you concerned for me, a stranger? Even though…" Harry swallowed, rubbing his arm, "You had to go through the trouble?" Harry asked, hands clasped in front of him. Biting down when the hand that clasped his shirt faltered, planting Harry's feet firmly on the ground.The anger that broke into loss lasted a moment too long. Wavering between confusion and a scowl before finally landing on the neutral frown that greeted Harry and Edwin this morning. The hand left, and Harry cradled his neck uncertainly. He winced as his fingers stroked his skin, stealing the occasional glance at Professor Snape. Bruised, obviously. But now wasn't the time to worry.The Professor didn't snap. Nor did his rage return. Instead, he cleared his throat. Averting his eyes to the window in the corner when he spoke, "Into bed with you, Mr Potter. I shall not have you injuring my property any further."The hand that touched Harry's shoulder didn't have anything to do with the fear that plunged into his stomach. It stabbed him in the gut and twisted, pulled out and let the emotions gush wild in its wake with a grin.Harry fell once more. On his knees, this time. He stared up, eyes wide and shaking his head viciously from side to side, "I-I broke something?"The Professor raised a brow, opening his mouth to answer before Harry jabbed in again, "I broke something when I fell, didn't I? The chimney lining? The wood stands?" he said, heaving the words - rushing through them while his mind raced further, faster."That's why Uncle Vernon was here, wasn't he? I broke something and he had to come. Master Edwin told him that I ruined something and he came to take me back!""Mr Potter-""I'm sorry!" Harry shouted, sliding back until his back hit the bed. Lifting his arms, Harry squeezed his head. With eyes closed tightly, and now rocking back and forward, he cried, "I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I-I'll get the repayment, somehow, but please don't make Uncle Vernon pay for it. He-he-"The rest didn't come. Because now Harry was heaving. His breath raced, his heart clenching in all the wrong ways, and his stomach prickled with sharp needles over and over. He could no longer think.At first, Professor Snape didn't move. A confused look still firm in his face, lips thinned into a line. Harry didn't take much notice. Even as the Professor kneeled to his height, face now really concerned, Harry remained trapped in one flashback after another.Plates shattering, glass falling and the desperate hopelessness before he was hurled into the cupboard. Dark, small. The dust settled in his lungs, blood on his lips, and the smell of Aunt Petunia's perfume drifting into the cupboard. All the while, Harry rocked himself. When the fear came, when the door rattled closed on its hinges. Dark, small.Harry came back, eye-to-eye with Snape, and wiped the tears with his sleeve. The Professor's face was still sallow. Sallow and somehow grey. Black eyes searched him from within their narrow sockets."Mr Potter?""I'm fine.""Did you…" The Professor paused, then shook his head, "Nevermind. Up you get, Potter. To bed, now, or you will not get soup."Harry complied. Pushed himself up and slid under the covers, keeping his head down even after the Professor brought him a bowl of steaming chicken soup. He did not call for the Professor after he left, his mellow footsteps disappearing behind the closed door.He couldn't finish the soup.It was delicious, all the same.It wasn't Uncle Vernon that came the next morning. Instead, Edwin stood parading before the shop. He stomped harshly over the floorboards while the Professor, with much distaste, helped Harry down the stairs with a hesitant arm around his waist, stopping every few steps when Harry's head gave a hard spin."I don' see why I couldn'a come up myself," Edwin greeted, crossing his arms.The Professor chose to answer by dropping Harry in one of the leather chairs by the chimney. Then he straightened out the black shirt beneath his black waistcoat before turning to face him, clearing his throat, "So. The flue lining.""Wha' about 'em?""It's tarnished.""An' so?""It's your fault."Edwin's scowl was almost enough to rival Professor Snape's. Almost. The herbs and floral scents wafted through the air, ill-tempered and taking their rage out on Harry. At least for today. The herbs were pleasant the day before. A pleasant greeting in his nose. Now, they only distracted him. The room concealed behind a palette of odors."Now you listen to me, Professor," Edwin hissed, cocking his head to the side, gritting his teeth, "I am not payin' for none of your property. I told you I had to keep the boy in line. You told me to leave.""No supervision would have helped a boy falling down a chimney, Mr Edwin. And I find it hard to believe that you would have managed to catch him before his body collided with the stone. Can your meagre brain comprehend the damage the boy would have were it not for his fast-thinking? If he had not managed to restrict his momentum? A tarnished chimney flue would be the least of your worries."With his back to Harry, Professor Snape's face was hidden from view, but even then, by the way he stood firm and tall, his slender body almost arching over Edwin, Harry could imagine the man's expression. Rigid. Terrifying. Something Harry was thankful not to see."I am a decent man earnin' a livin'!"A few people passed by the shop, not stopping but staring nonetheless. Harry only noticed because of a woman's clothes. The colourful fabric a bright contrast to the dim, dark shop. A sort of light, in the boring palette. Her attention led Edwin to regain his posture. He took a step back, straightening his spine, "Get up, boy. We're leavin'."Harry's breath hitched. His hands clasped the armrest, straining his knuckles. Then Harry smelled the soup, felt the warmth of the brown quilt, and the ghost of a touch brushing his hair back, checking his fever, applying balm to his body, and wrapping the white bandages around his wrist before walking him down. Harry saw the real contrast, then. Of the cellar, of the soot. Of only looking at that red-headed family, only wishing for something that wasn't his.Professor Snape wasn't family.Harry told himself he wasn't attached. But the cold stung harshly when he stood.He limped the distance from the chair to Edwin. The wood creaked unnaturally under his foot. Wincing at the sound, Harry stopped directly beside Professor Snape, where he risked a look up. Professor Snape didn't return his smile. But Harry didn't mind, and made it known by mouthing the words very slowly: Thank you.He did clasp Harry's shoulder though, once Harry took a step forward. Bony fingers clawed into his skin, pulling him back. Harry almost tripped, flailing his arms until another hand balanced him, keeping him still.He didn't let go."Potter is not going anywhere."Edwin's bones cracked when his head whirled to face Professor Snape. His brows lifted in a way that showed surprise before knitting in a way that promised something a lot worse, "What?""He shall make adequate compensation. You refuse to pay, for you don't own the amount, and by having Mr Potter work in my shop without pay, I believe he can relieve the debt from the incident.Harry stared, bewildered, mouth opening and closing. Eyes rushing from one adult to the other, a hint of a smile rose on his lips when Edwin's face fell after Snape continued in the tense silence, "If not, the inspectors would be delighted with the report I give them. Especially so when one boy was almost severely injured. Are your arms up for the heavy labour that comes with the penance? If needed, I have just the balm. Mr Potter proved its efficiency via usage."He then turned to Harry, clasping his hands behind his back, "How is your back, Mr Potter?""Uh, em-" Harry stuttered, taken back by the address, "Much better, sir."Professor Snape looked to be proud of much more than merely his balm, surely. After he offered Edwin a prescription, Edwin turned around, stomped to the door, and before he slammed it close, shouted back, "Mark my words, Professor! You don' come complainin' about the boy. I'm not takin' 'em back! And you-" he faced Harry, "You work an' mind you, do it well. I don't ever wan' to see your face again and I'll tell Dursley exactly so!"The windows rattled, wobbling the jars lining the shelves. The bell hanging over the door chimed wildly after him, echoing. Swift, loud. His words settled like the sound, only producing a reaction long after it was rung."Did he-" Harry looked up, " - kick me out?"Professor Snape arched an eyebrow and turned to face the door. Eyeing the glass as if it were profoundly amusing, though Harry couldn't find anything funny about this situation. Professor Snape curled his lips, "Come, Mr Potter. There is much that can be learned during bed rest and my patience wears thin by the minute."Harry hesitated to follow after him, still facing the door, eyes pinned on the street Edwin had walked away from. All that trouble to earn his keep, all that hard work… those cold nights in the cellar where he dreamed of the Dursleys, warm and waiting for him after he'd proven his worth… And all it took was one accident. One fall. One prayer and Harry was kicked away, never to return."Mr Potter?"Harry wiped his eyes and followed, "Coming, sir."Professor Snape, as expected, valued academics and weighed a person's worth by their brains. He, also, stared wide-eyed, book still in hand after Harry had specifically told him he couldn't read."What?"Harry blushed, and hid his face behind the pillow above his knees. A copy of what was apparently Common Herbs and Identifications balanced on his legs."I was never taught, sir.""Never?"Harry meekly shook his head, feeling more wretched by the second. He didn't suppose it was fair for the Professor to belittle him for something he hadn't done. Or something no one had bothered to teach him when he could learn to earn some money and be useful.That was Aunt Petunia whenever she caught him sneaking a peek at Dudley's books or touched the spines of the volumes in the parlour while he dusted. Not that the Dursleys would read when they could spend their time gossiping about neighbours and attending operas. But Petunia's keen eye always spotted something out of place. It seemed like the only thing it could do, but Harry never said that out loud."My Aunt and Uncle didn't like me reading," he muttered in defence, "Said it was wasted on me."Professor Snape didn't comment. His fingers curled along the spine of another, much thicker book.So after ten seconds, when he emerged from his thoughts, Harry was taken aback when he was asked (ordered) to follow. The Professor's curtain of black hair billowed behind him while Harry struggled to keep up, finding it an especially hazardous task to walk down the stairs.In the shop, Professor Snape told him to stand behind the counter while he walked around it straight towards two of the leather chairs. He started to drag one behind him, however the legs screeched against the furnished wood, causing him to lift it half-heartedly, dropping it back down whenever the task got tedious.Once the chair was behind the counter, Professor Snape pointed a finger at it, "Sit. Wait here and if you value your fingers, do not touch anything."Harry fell in his chair just as Professor Snape stalked behind him to another door on the other side. Throwing it open he prowled inside, rushing down another flight of metal stairs, judging by the gradually falling sounds before eventually, there was nothing. Silence. Not a flinch, not even from a mouse. Not that he expected this shop to have any mice. Professor Snape's hair was greasy, and his skin sallow and pale over his thin face. But the clothes he wore (and lent Harry) were, if not of great quality, well kept. He had turned his nose at Harry's body - rolling the sleeves over his arms and legs, complaining about the wrinkles. But other than his hair, Professor Snape was one of the cleanest people Harry had seen, and his building was no different.The bell chimed the second time that morning. Harry couldn't see the visitor from his position. So he craned his neck up above the wood from side to side, wanting to see the owner of these light footsteps with equally light shoes."Severus?" a voice called. A woman's voice. Kind and curious. Warm. Harry enjoyed it awhile before his hand shot up, calling her over, "Um, Madam, over here."The voice fell silent. Her footsteps continued, then her face emerged from behind the wood and Harry, with guilt, found himself disappointed. The woman, around the same age as Professor Snape, if not younger, wore a black dress that pooled down her body, hiding her shape. Not only that, but a long fabric veiled her head, masking her hair and neck and draping down her chest."Oh dear," she looked down, a hand over her thin lips, "Well. Good morning, young man.""Good morning," Harry replied, making sure to look at her eyes - kind- like his mother from a dream, "I'm Harry.""My name is Aisha Patel," said the woman that looked like his mother. Especially with the long, black fabric that fluttered down her head and her light brown skin. Harry was now very thankful that his bangs covered most of the scar that covered his forehead, "What are you doing down there, Harry?""Professor Snape asked me to sit down.""Asked you?""Well, he didn't say please, now that you've mentioned it, Madam Patel,"Madam Patel laughed, hiding her mouth with the back of her hand, "Oh dear. But oddly enough, he isn't here now."Harry shook his head and then pointed to the door Professor Snape had disappeared down , "No. He went down there."Madam Patel nodded knowingly, "To the laboratory.""The laborty?""La-bo-ra-to-ry," Madam Patel pronounced each syllable and Harry mouthed after, testing the word in his mouth, "What does he do in the laboratory?"Madam Patel gestured around the shop, "Oh, many things. Medicine, teas. Personal research, if I know him well enough. And I daresay I don't," she chuckled at her joke, "He's a proclaimed chemist, a very talented one, at that.""So he doesn't just sell… Herbs?""Oh, dear, no. Creams, balms, the whole lot. He even takes custom orders, if it matches his skill set. Most often than not, it does.""I have yet to be challenged," Professor Snape's voice disrupted. He closed the door to the laboratory behind him. Crossing the distance between Harry and the wall in a few steps, placing both a blackboard and a jar wrapped in brown paper over the counter, "You've arrived early, Professor Patel.""Oh dear, have I? You don't like to be kept waiting, last I remember," she answered, retrieving a coin sack from, counting the coins on the counter.His lips quirked up, "No, I do not. And we've discussed the matter of payment, have we not?"You also do not like engaging with children outside of school. And yes, we have discussed it," she slid over a stack of coins, eyeing Harry, making him duck his head, "An assistant of yours?""A nuisance, more likely."Harry glared, biting the inside of his cheek. He locked eyes with Professor Patel. Seeing as Professor Snape, who valued titles despite not agreeing by their affiliations, used them, Harry did so as well, "I'm no nuisance."Professor Snape chuckled, plucking the money from the counter. He then unlocked a drawer on their side of the counter with a key he lifted from his pants pocket, sliding it open and placing them in corresponding sections separated by thin pieces of wood before closing and locking it again, "If you require no more assistance, I shall ask you to leave, Professor Patel. Harry and I have much work to be done."Professor Patel lifted the jar, eyes narrowed in concern, and brows knitted close together as she and Harry shared another long glance. That eased her frown. The corners of her lips lifted into a smile and Harry felt warmth suffuse his cheeks, evidence of the surprise from being called by his first name."Don't derive your pleasure from insulting his intelligence, Professor Snape.""You assume he has intelligence in the first place."This time, Harry did notice the sudden turn of personality. Mouth gaping open, staring at the smirking Professor, the memories of the two days blended fast and strong. Professor Snape helping him to bed. Professor Snape rubbing the balm into his back, suspicious, even after Harry assured him the bruises were from the fall. (They weren't, but he didn't need to know that.) Professor Snape healing him, making sure his fever broke before retreating. Caring, concerned. Keeping him anchored and away from Edwin, though the hands on his shoulders gripped too hard.Professor Snape insulting him. Scouting for the minute he was well and scorning him for it with a grudge Harry hadn't caused."I assume he has more than he's letting on. And not just intelligence," she said, then placed the jar in her bag, "Shall I deliver your regards to Minerva and Poppy?"Professor Snape nodded, "Please do.""Take care, Professor, Harry,"She turned, her robes flying behind her, and soon she too was gone."So you…" Harry began, "So you two know each other?""We work at the same school facility,""Ah," he nodded, no longer eager to interact with Professor Snape, "She's very beautiful."Well, not very. Harry had seen much prettier women over the years. With modelled hair and touches of make-up, colourful, grand dresses that fluttered after them. Professor Patel didn't show any hair, and her skin, darker than Harry's, was make-up free and her dress looked like it had lost its colour long ago. But, Harry smiled, her warmth was vibrant."Is she?" Professor Snape asked, bent over the chalkboard, "Not many call her that, upon first meeting."Harry shrugged, "She looks like my mom."The chalk in Professor Snape's hand gave a nasty, ear-splitting screech. Harry could see half of it between his fingers, while the rest lay broken on the material. The writing beneath was jagged, jerked in the wrong direction. Angry, though Harry couldn't imagine why.Professor Snape's back straightened. He ignored Harry. Instead, his eyes remained pinned to the door, as if he saw something Harry could not."What did you say?" he asked, still looking away.Harry swallowed. The lump in his throat wouldn't loosen, though. Even after the second gulp, "My mother… She has long black hair and kind eyes. Maybe dark skin, as well, because my father has red hair and green eyes. I can't imagine him having dark skin, because I've never seen any red-haired person with brown skin, but it'll probably be him because Aunt Petunia is in no way dark-skinned."Professor Snape's hands met on the counter. His head lifted. As if his neck had gone stiff from Harry's words. And it must have. Harry found no reason for the Professor to have gone meek over such a statement. He decided to ask, opening his mouth when Professor Snape spoke once more."And who has told you about this?""No one, sir. Aunt Petunia only told me that they left me on their doorstep because they were poor and didn't want me-"The sound of hands slamming against the wood silenced his words. It also made Harry flinch, one hand jerking up to his shoulder, clutching his shirt. Professor Snape didn't look, of course. He acted as though he was personally insulted. That or someone had disappointed him by dropping a bad odour in his shop. A very, very horrid odour, worse even than the herbs.Harry said nothing more. But then Professor Snape turned around, the grin from Professor Patel's presence long gone. His eyes downcast and emotional. Professor Snape took a step towards him. Harry straightened his back. Leaning forward, despite there being no possibility of being heard, the professor whispered, "You do not share this information, or any information about yourself, with anyone. Anyone. Do I make myself clear, Mr Potter?"Harry had an answer ready. A long string of answers, actually. The first one was a question, Why? Why couldn't he? He'd shared it among his sweeper family. They all had. At nights, near fires. When one was bored when none could read, and the only stories they'd been taught leaked clear and clean from their lips. But a bigger question blared louder. In the background, huddled to a corner. Afraid to be noticed and still screaming when Harry blurted it out."You know my name."Professor Snape's eyes widened. Just a bit, but Harry still noticed."I never told you my name," he snapped, "Master Edwin didn't, either. He called me a boy. You called me by my surname ever since I came here, but not in front of Professor Patel. Why?Adults turned amusing, whenever they were backed into the corner. Childish, confused. Much like Professor Snape. The wrinkles around his eyes appeased. His open lips complemented his confusion. Harry was beginning to like the situation less and less by the minute, "I said how do you know my name!"Professor Snape took a step back, looking down at him by the length of his nose, "Tantrums will do you no good."'"I don't care!" Harry screamed, chest heaving. A blur swam in his vision and mind. His chest seized with uncomfortable tightness. The days under Professor Snape's 'care' no longer held the same warmth and comfort as before."You know my name. Professor Patel must have as well since you've only used my first name. And I want to know why. I want you to play fair!""You, of all people, should know that life isn't-""Well, you should work for it, then! It's my life, and I deserve to know what you're hiding-""Mr Potter!"Harry's mouth clamped shut. His hands balled into fists, squeezed against his legs. The anger didn't leave. In fact, Harry felt his fury rising the longer he stared at the man. The heart thumping in his ears muffled any sound, the injustice of it all suffocating his patience, even more so when Snape spoke again."I am in no obligation to share anything with a brat who can't keep himself in line. Anything! You are here to pay a debt, after which you will leave. Furthermore, during this time, you will act with dignity in my presence! Am I understood?"Harry refused to share his thoughts. He nodded"A verbal answer, Mr Potter.""Yes," he hissed. The way Snape's shoulders fell made him bite the inside of his cheeks, suppressing a scream.Snape left for the counter. Then came back with the small chalkboard from earlier. He smudged the fifth symbol to the right with a cloth. The board wiped clean before he drew it again. Half a circle, with a smaller copy to its right. Harry knitted his brows. They sort of resembled-"Today, Mr Potter," Snape said with a controlled voice. He handed the chalk to Harry, dropping the board on his knee, "You shall be learning how to read."

TW: PTSD dream at the beginning of the italics.Thanks to absinthe, my beta reader, for her much-valued efforts in the story.Enjoy :)It took Harry only one week to learn the alphabet. Snape complained that it would have taken him much sooner had he not procrastinated and given it his 'full attention, pathetic though it may be'. Between sweeping the shop and tending the counter, Harry wasn't sure how he was delaying the task. The alphabet proved to be much easier than the currency he had to learn. Adding and subtracting numbers, all while Snape stalked behind him - a hand pushing him to the side when both the customer and Snape grew impatient - was difficult.Snape was trying to teach him to learn on the spot. Harry called him a git for it.Not outloud.Harry didn't ask for things he wouldn't get, but neither would he refuse what was offered. Or dismiss the efforts made by others purely for his sake. So during his stay, when Snape took him out and bought him clothes from a second-hand store, Harry decided to keep his mouth shut for at least a week, ignoring every biased criticism.Ignoring was doing too much courtesy.Harry didn't ignore them. He suppressed them long enough by scratching his arms, pinching his skin, and clenching his jaw under his cap before Snape would walk away, leaving him to stew in the anger until Harry vented it by screaming into the pillow in his room.The room was a different matter. Decorated in dull colors, some days Harry felt the room gradually shrink. Small, dusty. Just like the cupboard. The last swirls of light shyly recoiling away. It made Harry choke, woke him up from the occasional bad dream, and left him exhausted to the bone for Snape to poke fun at.Then the cycle would continue.Not today.Harry stared at Snape, then looked down at his hand. He weighed the money pouch stuffed with coins and a folded piece of paper, squeezing the fabric. The edges of the coins dug into his skin. A reminder, rooting him down."I don't understand.""Frankly, I am not surprised."Harry told himself to bite it back. Lifting his head, he held the paper above his head for Snape to see, "I can't read this.""Surely you've learnt every letter in the alphabet?" Snape asked, lifting a brow. His lips curling into a grin, the first one Harry had seen that week."Yes, but-""And you can recognize them in different textures?""Yes, but-"And are you well-versed in basic money handling?""I am, but-"Snape held a hand to silence him, standing up from his chair and assisting a customer, one Augusta Longbottom, who was old and just as tall, thin and bony. She carried with her a bright red handbag and an atrocious hat that held a stuffed vulture- with some medicine for her grandson. Harry waited by the chimney for fifteen minutes, trying to decipher the list before Snape returned. His mind was puzzled by the letter. The accumulated knowledge escaped him."I can't read this, Professor," he said, shaking the list in the air, "You know I can't."Snape wiped his hands on his apron, marching around him to the shelf directly above the chimney, tapping a jar, "What does it say here potter?"Harry squinted. He stood up, walking to Snape's side to read the label, "G-ginger, right?""Correct. Tell me, what is the last item on the list?"Harry smoothed out the paper. He slid a finger down the crumpled page and replied, bitterly, "Ginger."Snape smirked. Gripping the jar, he lifted the lid. Holding it down, he waved it under Harry's nose. The smell invaded him. It bit, hard, gnawing and not letting go - inducing a cough long after Snape placed the jar back."And that," he said, crossing his arms, "Is how it smells."Harry wrinkled his nose, suddenly glad that Aunt Petunia didn't store it in her kitchen because it was atrocious, "I don't like it.""You'll love it no more when you have to fill the jar after you come back," he squinted his eyes when Harry gagged, "Just ask the man down two streets for the amount specified, and no one else. You'll need to make more than one trip, undoubtedly, with those pitiful arms of yours. I'm not mending any broken bones, not after you've finally healed," he stilled, "Well, most of you, in any case."Harry's bones were another recurring argument in the household, this time linked to Harry's eating habits. Or rather, the lack thereof. Snape seemed to find Harry's forgetfulness when it came to meals or not finishing even half of his plate as a problem. Even more so the way Harry stared at his food, as if it was going to be snatched away any second. Harry didn't understand what the problem was. His stomach filled before the food was finished, and it meant he could have some later, when Severus wasn't looking.Harry nodded, pocketing the paper and sack in his new, brown pants. Walking to the coat rack, Harry reached for his cap on his tiptoes. The coat rack gave a rattle once the cap was pulled down from the wood and over Harry's mop of black hair."I'll be leaving, then."A customer walked in right as Harry walked out, and Snape gave him a stiff nod, turning to tend to an old man with a cane."What do you mean you're closing?"The man shook his head, rubbing his neck with one hand, "My daughter's given birth, kid. Nothing I can do. Tell the Professor to send you back tomorrow," the man said, turning his back and locking the door. He pulled on his jacket, buttoning it over his wide stomach with some difficulty. He put on a tattered hat over his balding head before reaching for his pocket. He pulled out Harry's list, handing it back to him and rubbed the edge of his moustache between two fingers, "Give my regards to the Professor," he tipped his hat, looking both ways before crossing the street to join his wife.Harry stood very still, looking after the man as he helped his wife onto a horse before hopping on himself. They smiled as the horse started to trot up the street, mixing with the street traffic.The voices meddled with Harry's thoughts and met with the image of Snape accosting him for returning empty-handed. Harry feared he would send him after the man to retrieve his precious ginger, ordering him not to return until he had come back with one whole bag and nothing less. He wrapped his arms around his stomach, slouching. Snape wouldn't kill him for something out of his control, would he? He didn't kill him after Harry's outburst last week, though he made his displeasure known in many different ways. Harry shook his head, breath wavering. The sound of his footsteps fading in the background.Don't slow down. Don't stop. Don't breathe.Harry didn't realize someone was calling his name until a hand landed on his shoulder, jolting the world to a stop. The mist didn't leave at once, but the world regained its colour when Oliver spoke.When Oliver spoke?"What are ya doing, Harry?" Oliver asked with a frown, "And where were ya! We thought ya had gone off! Marie-Lue was barking mad, I'm telling ya. Crying every night!"Harry stared, touching his mouth. He parted his lips when Oliver snapped his fingers to draw his attention, "Ya alright, Harry?""I-I'm... I'm alright, Oliver. I'm so sorry. But not dead, as you can tell.""Yeah, but were ya? Master Edwin didn't say nuffink, but 'e was acting quite off. Like 'e had lost a bet."Not so far off. Harry scratched his hair under the cap, giving a nervous smile to the people who were now walking around them, scoffing at the way the two blocked the road.Oliver noticed as well. He took Harry by the arm, pulling him to an alley near a bookstore. Harry almost snatched his hand away once Oliver's hand touched his. It was rough and scratched with the soot Harry had not missed climbing up into."Ya clothes a different too. And ya skin," Oliver said, dropping his brush and bag of soot. He took out his cap, dusting the black heaps from his light brown hair, and smearing his skin with the back of his hand, "What happened?"Harry bit his lip, shifting his weight from one foot to the next, "Sorry... but it's a long story.""Tell me anyway.""You're not going to like it, Oliver.""Let me hear it, either way."Harry scratched his face. His mouth had gone dry. Looking at Oliver now, Harry didn't know how he could tell Oliver about Snape while his friend still worked under Edwin, cleaning chimneys for a living, risking his life at every climb while Harry only risked an argument with Snape, which was beginning to resemble less of a threat by the minute."Harry, I'm ya friend. Tell me wha' ya have been doing."Harry took in a breath, quick and short. He glanced both ways to see if anyone was listening and leaned forward, pulling Oliver down by the shirt, "Remember the shop Master Edwin dragged me to last week?"Oliver nodded."The man working there -Severus Snape- I was sweeping his chimney. I reached the top and when sliding down, uh-" Harry darted his eyes, lowering his chin when he felt his ears heat up, "Fell down-""Fell down?"Harry's cheeks heated as well, and he gave a weak nod."Must have been a bad one, if ya fell. Bad bricks?"Harry paused, staring at a passing man's ruffled hair and dirty moustache, "Yeah, bad bricks.""At least ya haven't gone off, mate. But I why haven't ya come back?"Harry saw no point in hiding it from Oliver any longer, hurt him though it may. So he began. He told him about how after he fell, Snape helped heal him. How he told Edwin off. How he bought him the clothes Harry was wearing, while Oliver kept silent and Harry kept folding and unfolding his arms in a constant loop, searching for a sign of discomfort on Oliver's face. He didn't find any, which only led to more nerves, more jittery movement.Snape caring, Snape not caring. In this situation, Harry didn't know whether to hate the man or respect him, or look for something more. He still couldn't forgive what had happened in the shop just before Snape started to teach him the alphabet, when he shouted at him to not ask questions about his past. Nor the week that followed with insults and undeserved scoldings.By the time Harry stopped talking, dislike and respect walked hand-in-hand."Ya seem to be doing well for ya self, Harry," said Oliver rather quietly, rubbing his arm. The whole street lost its sound but still whirled in the background feverishly. The soot's odor grew to a nauseating level, to the point that it hurt to breathe"Uh, yeah. I'm glad Snape is willing to be... generous, despite it all."Oliver chuckled meekly. Harry's guilt grew to an ugly height once he saw his friend's bloodshot eyes underscored by angry bags. The blue Harry once knew was lost behind an emotion Harry couldn't understand.Liar. Harry understood well enough.He just didn't want to acknowledge it.Harry cleared his throat, "Sorry, uh...How are the others?" he asked because there wasn't anything else to say."Marie-Lue cried her eyes out. Might have filled the Thames, with that amount of tears. Mums almost broke his leg, but Davi shared some sweets he nicked from a house yesterday.""Everything's fine?""Everything's fine, Harry. Ya just..." Oliver bit his lip, then offered a smile, brows knit tight, "Don't work too hard to repay the debt, yeah? Marie-Lue will be okay with us.""Oliver-""Harry, stop. You're in a better place. A much better place than us, at least," Oliver said, then leaned against the wall behind him, a shadow cast across his features, "Keep it. A chimney lining isn't anything cheap. Work well, prove ya self useful. The Professor is sure ta keep ya if he learns that you're a good worker."Harry's shoulders fell and he looked at Oliver as if he'd grown another head, "You don't... you don't think I'm doing this to get away from Edwin, do you?""Ya not?""No!" Harry said. He took a step back, then clutched his friend by the shoulders, "Oliver, you're my family! I can't just live my life pretending you don't exist!""I'm not saying ya should-""We're going to grow up together. In a house, in town. With good food, warm beds and-"Oliver grabbed Harry's wrist, pulling them away from his shoulders, "Ya want the best for ya family?"Harry nodded, feeling a little uncomfortable with Oliver's grip."Ya family wants the best for ya, Harry."The words, lined in perfect order, went through one ear. It didn't go out the other. Instead, it spiralled into an echo, lighting up warmly in his mind. Pinned to the back of his head where Harry accepted it willingly, wanting to grow it for comfort during those long, hurtful nights.Harry wiped his eyes to get rid of the urge to cry. He accepted the hug, wrapping his arms around Oliver. It was shorter than he would have wanted, but when they parted, leaving the alley, the week of insults didn't hurt as much as before."Ya look after ya self, Harry. I heard there's a fugitive walking around, these days. A murderer.""Don't think he'll come after me, Oliver," Harry said, chuckling and wiping his reddened nose. Noticing the look Oliver gave him, Harry ducked his head, murmuring a quick apology.Oliver shook his head, then patted him on the shoulder, "Visit us one day, will ya? And let the Professor know you've been gettin' pains, even though you healed. Promise?"Harry felt the need to apologise for that, too. For complaining about the pain in his body and the headaches while Snape worked hard to heal him. So he apologised to Oliver, and apologised again once Oliver told him not to apologise before promising to let Snape know once he got home."I will. Tell the other's I said hello, and that I miss them. Maybe hug Marie-Lue, will ya?"Oliver nodded and was the first to turn around. Harry did the same, ready to walk back, hands in his pockets when Oliver called his name once more."And Harry?"Harry turned, tilting his head."Happy early birthday."The customer smiled as Harry handed her the Honeysuckle tea in a brown paper bag, handing him the coins before walking out, the bell not ringing behind her. Harry couldn't remember where Snape had gotten the tea from, or even if he sold any tea, but the customer was already gone, so he didn't bother calling after them.Harry sorted through Snape's drawer, storing the coins in all the wrong places. The bell chimed, and Harry lifted his head to see Professor Patel walking through the doors, smile on her face."Professor Patel!" Harry shouted, the coins flying out of his hand as he jumped over the counter, taking her by the hand before wrapping his arms around her waist, his hands lost in the black fabric, "Did you come for the tea?""Of course I did, Harry," Professor Patel said, running a gloved hand through his hair, lifting his hair to reveal his scar, "Oh dear, that's a nasty little thing, isn't it?"Harry blushed, straightening his pitch black hair over the scar that turned and twisted on his skin. Sharp lines spiraling on his forward and down his face, "I got it the day you left me, Aunt Petunia said. After an incident. She didn't tell me what it was.""It was a fire."Harry nodded, leaning his head on her chest, then turning it to the side to breathe, "A wild fire.""Oh dear. Harry-" his mom pushed him away, walking to the counter. Her black dress swirling into a blue gown, the black color leaking like smoke from her dress and messing the floor, "You've sorted the coins all wrong!""What?"When his mom turned her head, the black veil around her face dissolved into sleek, black hair. It slid down her back, flowing like a dark waterfall, and floated behind her as she walked towards him. Harry took a step back, because with every step his mom took forward, the world warped itself black, surrounding the shop in shadow until Harry was left alone. That's when the sounds began. Crashing plates. Angry screams. All exploding in his ears at the same time while the walls around the shop started to close in.Harry couldn't breath. He screamed among the voices, pounding against the walls, "No! Get me out! I want to breathe! I can't- I can't-!"His body jolted in wild tremors, shaking with terror. Harry couldn't run. He pounded, and pounded, hands not hurting because now, Aunt Petunia's perfume slid down his throat, choking him. Harry collapsed to the ground, holding his throat. Tears slid down his face while his chest tightened in tremendous pain. Squeezing. Squeezing. A thousand needles and burning sand pricking and puncturing his throat, charring his skin. And Harry was still afraid. Of not being able to breathe again, of hurting. And Harry was angry, because it was unfair. So, so unfair while he suffered, no one else did and now, while he lived better than the others, his family lived no different.And Harry knew he was drowning. His hand loosened just as the floor gave away, dropping him down a long way. Falling, falling, falling. Patches of white light speckled his vision before they rippled into the coherent scenery of Snape's shop.Snape was there, back turned to Harry, looking over at the mess Professor Patel had left behind her.Harry coughed into his hand, rolling to his back on the ground. The wood cut into his skin, digging deep until Harry screamed, and screamed and-Snape turned, livid and easily the scariest thing Harry had seen in his life. He stalked towards him, but Harry couldn't scoot back, as if he was fastened to the wood. Dread filled him, a bubbling clump before it gushed out with an agonizing explosion. "I'm sorry! Professor Snape, I didn't do it! Please, believe me, I-""Potter!""I'm sorry! Professor Snape, I'm so sorry!"Snape took him by the shoulder, giving him a sharp tug forward, "Potter!""I'm sorry!"The light of the apothecary dissolved into black. It left Harry among tangled sheets, his skin wet with sweat and heart pounding at a distressing speed.Someone was holding him by the shoulders. Not shaking him, but nudging him rather gently, another hand untangling the sheets wrapped around his arms and legs."P-professor?""You were having a nightmare," spoke his voice in the dark, matter of factly. The sheets successfully peeled from his body and dropped in a heap on the floor, "I found you whimpering and shaking your head."Harry sat up. Professor Snape's hand didn't let go until Harry steadied his back against the headboard, leaning back on the hard wood."Stay here," Snape said, and Harry opened one eye, the bed lifting at the loss of weight. He almost reached a hand, almost asked for him to stay.He didn't, of course. Professor Snape's footsteps disappeared out of the room, accompanied by a splash of water a few moments later before returning. The door creaked as Professor Snape nudged it open, then again when he closed it. No moon tonight. No moon to shine light on Professor Snape while he pushed a glass of water into Harry's hands, urging for him to drink.He waited patiently, no doubt having questions, and Harry took as long as he could with that glass of water."I'm sorry about the ginger, Professor," Harry said to avoid any questions, "I tried to explain to the vendor.""We've discussed it already, upon your return. In fact, I don't remember blaming you for it."Harry took another sip, "I know. But I never apologised, did I?"Snape sighed, "I'll send you to buy some tomorrow morning, if that makes you feel better.It did, but Harry still let the conversation drop after that."Do you have nightmares frequently?" Professor Snape asked, plucking the finished glass and setting it on the bedside table, "Or is this a rare occurrence?"His silence stretched far too long, and so he wasn't surprised Professor Snape snorted once Harry said, "No.""What did you dream about?""I don't want to talk about it, sir.""Hmm."The silence stretched again. This time, Professor Snape didn't ask him to speak, but at the end of it, he nudged him by the shoulder as he stood up, "Come, Potter. Some fresh air before you sleep."Harry groaned, wanting nothing more than to put his head on the pillow and sleep until the exhaustion in his bones lifted. Professor Snape pulled him by the arm, far gentler than Harry expected, and led him to the window.He let go of Harry to lift the window. Parting the blinds first, he dug his fingers under the wood and shoved it open with some brutal force.The wind lifted some of Harry's hair, freezing the sweaty skin. Harry didn't mind. He closed his eyes, swaying with the wind, head leaning against the wall while the night air filled his lungs, scattering some of the effects of the nightmare."You have them often," said Professor SnapeHarry opened one eye, turning his face to the Professor. No moonlight tonight. Harry could still make out his lean form. Almost too thin, even in the light, "I don't want to talk about it.""I'm not asking you to share it.""But you want me to.""Yes," Professor Snape said, turning his head from the window to face him, "I do."Harry bit his tongue looking out into the city. No light, no moon. Only black, soulless masses."Why?""Because I only noticed now. And only because I woke up to get a glass of water myself, and as luck would have it, decided to check up on you.""I don't believe in luck.""Neither do I," Professor Snape said with a dry chuckle, closing the window and leading him to bed, "Neither do I."The bed felt warmer, almost more comfortable as Harry lay on it. Somehow welcoming. Professor Snape didn't help him with the sheet, but waited until Harry was under them, head on his pillow and eyes closed."Sleep, Potter," he said, right before walking to the door and closing it behind him.Somehow, Harry did.The next evening, the door opening interrupted Harry's sweeping session. Harry lifted his head to greet the customer because Snape was in his laboratory, doing what he always did, cooped up in the room. Harry had a growing suspicion that it wasn't as enjoyable as Snape made it out to be, since he couldn't imagine the room getting any sunlight. Nonetheless, he wasn't here now, and Harry was stationed in his absence to tend to any customers.But this wasn't a customer.Harry paused mid-sweep to find a boy -his age or older- with tattered clothes waiting by the door, a patched cap hiding his very short hair. The boy walked up to him, hands in his pockets, standing at least a head over Harry as he stopped."Good morning," said Harry, because it was polite as well as a habit Snape had carved into him, "Can I help you?""Is there a bloke called, uh, Professor Snape 'ere?" the boy asked uncertainly, gesturing at the shop."Uh, yeah.""Where is 'ee?"Harry pointed at the door that led down to the laboratory, "Down there.""Fetch 'em for me.""What?""Look, I 'ave a message to deliver, alright?" the boy asked with mild annoyance, taking out an envelope from his jacket pocket and extending it for Harry to see, "'Ere. Now fetch 'em for me. The man who gave it to me told me to 'urry up."Harry, delighted to be able to recognise Snape's name nodded. Leaning the broom against the chimney, Harry walked around the counter to the door, a little nervous to interrupt the man, as always. He'd done this before. Done it more time than necessary to worry about Snape's reaction.Harry pushed the door open, which led to a small landing that transitioned into a staircase that spiraled down.Making an effort not to look inside, Harry shouted for Snape."Excuse me, Professor Snape!" he called out, just like he was taught, "Someone sent you a message."A short while later, Professor Snape called back in a less than delighted voice, "Who?"I don't know, sir. It came in an envelope."Harry could hear the displeasure in Snape's footsteps. They grew louder until Snape stepped out, a little hunched with prominent bags under his eyes. He looked awful, worse than the past few days when he had started to grow rather… miserable.His hair was greasier than usual. The clothes he wore had started to smell too, but the usually very tidy Professor Snape seemed to have no intention of future personal grooming. Or any grooming, really. Harry was the only one that tended to the shop, doing any additional work while the Professor locked himself in his dungeon, leaving Harry sweeping, mopping, and dusting the shop and house. The cooking was no different. The meals had diminished to a notable quality. Harry didn't mind, of course. But during the almost ten days here, it was uncharacteristic to see Snape in such a… depressed mood."Who sent you?" Snape hissed at the boy, grabbing the letter and not bothering with a letter opener, ripping the envelope and starting to read."I don't know, sir. Just gave me this envelope and told me to-""Right," Snape said, crunching the envelope in one hand, looking both pleased and angry, "On your way, now, if you've been paid your price.The boy nodded. Touching the tip of his cap, he turned on his heel and trotted out the door, disappearing down the street.With a sudden turn, Snape was moving again. Crossing the distance between the laboratory door with wide steps, he slipped down to the cellar. He came back a short while later dressed in a long, black coat, and carrying a leather doctor's bag with him. He also wore a hat, in favor of his hair, one would guess. He spared no time in rummaging through the shelves, throwing in some jar or the other."Potter," Snape turned to Harry, marching towards him."S-sir?""Take some pounds out of the safe-box," he said while passing him, forcing the key to his hand, "And hurry, I don't have all day."Harry's hands flailed for the key, almost dropping it. With a crude nod, Harry moved to the drawer, unlocking it and pulling out said pounds, an eye on Snape who was kneeling beside the drawers and shelves under the counter.Snape left. Harry followed after him, locking the drawer. Already by the door by the time Harry reached him, he took the money, counting it with his eyes and handing him some back."I'm expected on a house visit, Potter and need you to finish some tasks for me. Are you listening?"Harry nodded, looking up through his hair."Go down to my laboratory. There, on the longest table, you will find a brown bag labeled ginger, the one you bought this morning. Though it's small, I'm confident even you can't miss it. Fill the jar up here with the ginger in the bag. Then, drop the box key inside the vase of dry flowers on the same table. And finally," he pulled a key from inside his jacket, dangling it by a small, rusted chain in front of his face, "Lock up after me. Do not open for anyone, especially if-" he closed his mouth and eyes as if in pain, "Regardless of what anyone says, no one is to enter the shop. Understood?"Another nod. Harry made a grab for the key, but Snape snatched it away just as his fingers brushed it, "A verbal answer, Mr Potter.""Yes, sir."Snape raised a brow. Harry sighed, folding his arms over his chest, "Sorry, I… Yes. I understand, Professor. I will not open the door. What now? Oh, fine. I won't answer the bloody door, regardless of what anyone says.""You are not prone to keeping promises, Mr Potter," Snape said, dropping the key to his hands, "I am taking precautions.""Oliver thinks the same," replied Harry, pocketing the money and box key, "You two would get along fine, I think.""Oliver?""He's a friend. From Mr Edwin. He's the one I bumped into yesterday.""Yesterday?"Harry's throat went dry and he almost slapped himself in the forehead. Of course. He had purposely not told Snape about him when he hadn't questioned his tardiness, as to not pester him with the pain in his body, which had grown from a dull thud to an uncomfortable throb this morning."Yes," Harry replied, rubbing the back of his head, "He was the reason I was late.""You didn't tell me about this.""Sorry sir," Harry bit back, deciding to be bold, "But you haven't asked."Snape looked like he was going to snap back something equally rude or something worse. But he sighed instead, pinching the bridge of his nose instead, "I haven't got the time nor energy to deal with this, Potter. We will discuss it at a more appropriate time, do not doubt that," Snape said, opening the door and stepping out, "Lock the door. I'll be back before later."Then he was gone, a lonely walker on the sidewalk, a stranger among many more strangers.Harry, of course, did lock the door.He then walked to the shelf, where the jar stood, and pulled it down from above the chimney, forcing the lid open and wrinkling his nose at the smell. Turning around to head to the cellar with some curiosity, he stopped when movement in the window caught his eye.The jar almost dropped from his hands when he saw who it was.Uncle Vernon and Aunt Marge, fuming behind the window and pounding at the door.And they weren't pleased to see him.Well! That was that. We finally have the ball rolling, I am pleased to say. Do not worry, by the time I'm posting this, I am more than 4000 words into the next chapter, thank God. Also, Eid tomorrow! Eid Mubarak, guys! See you soon!Also, I wanted to clear things by saying there isn't magic in this story. But do not worry, I have found an alternative for almost everything :D. Almost. We still have a long way to go until the story ends, so just sit back, relax and read to your heart's content.Finally, I don't know how to respond to reviews on this website, but I read every single one of them and thank each one of you. Your reviews are the driving source of this story (or any story). So don't hesitate to tell me anything.Salam!

TW for another trigger, around where the jar breaks."U-Uncle Vernon?" Harry asked, voice thin air, and squinting his eyes to have a clear look, desperately wishing he was mistaken, "Aunt Marge?"No. Though Harry admitted that his eyesight wasn't perfect, Uncle Vernon was impossible to miss from any distance with his size. Least of all if he was accompanied by his sister of equal proportion. The recognition aside, it was now a matter of what to do. Snape had made it very, very  clear he wasn't supposed to open the door to anyone, and Uncle Vernon was undoubtedly included in the list. Definitely included in the list, seeing as he wasn't looking very pleased to him either.Uncle Vernon started to pound against the glass. Aunt Marge soon joined him. The fists didn't sound like they were pounding on the glass, though. Instead, Harry felt his Uncle's meaty hands slamming against the back of his head, a vile pulse. His Uncle chose to shout at that moment, rattling the door with a mighty strike."Open this door now, boy!" Uncle Vernon roared, yanking the door handle up and down, "Open it or I'll do something you'll regret!"Harry's heart pounded. Fast, unhinged. The morning's breakfast now very much eager to rise up his throat and out his mouth. Uncle Vernon's face was starting to colour, an extraordinary purple that started to rise from his small neck, ruffling his moustache as it went. Harry's hands shook the more Uncle Vernon spat out his words. But even then, the impatience on Aunt Marge's face looked far more lethal. And though Harry had witnessed various dangerous expressions over the years, he could only come up with one person that could rival Aunt Marge in the matter. The same person who had trusted him to not open the door to any guest.The same person whose trust Harry was about to break.Still clutching the open jar of ginger, Harry walked to the door, balancing the glass in one hand while he fumbled for the key in his pocket.Harry liked to imagine many things. He liked to imagine Snape, at that moment. Running. Running fast. Down the street and towards the shop. Snape wasn't a knight. He didn't wear armour; he didn't fight holy battles. Brave, kind, and honest were all that a hero was and what Snape could never be. But Harry didn't want a knight in shining armour. Harry didn't believe in tales and only grew up with the ugly truth called life. And life wasn't playing fair.Because Harry wanted an escape.And Snape didn't come running down. His coat, mended and patched along the edges, didn't billow. Snape didn't come.Harry's hands shook while he slipped the key to the lock, the door opening with an ominous click. It turned the dread inside Harry gruesome, his eyes still darting down the street, waiting for the familiar pair of shoes on the cobblestone. Stepping back to let them in, Harry's back hit the wall when Uncle Vernon hit him by the shoulder while marching forward. Harry cradled his shoulder, now stiff, his body rigid and afraid to move."So-" Uncle Vernon barked, hands on his hips and small eyes darting along the walls while Aunt Marge took a closer look, namely inspecting the jars with a tap against the glass, "-So, you thought you could get away, eh? Thought you tricked us, having Edwin off his knocker, screaming bloody murder in our neighbourhood? In our neighbourhood?"Aunt Marge humphed in agreement, plopping down on one of the armchairs, muttering something Harry couldn't quite understand about leather."Uncle Vernon, please listen to me," Harry said softly, almost begging. Because, really, this wasn't any different than what it was with Snape, was it? An angry adult, a situation where Harry was 'in the wrong', and a conflict that needed to be avoided.But Snape hadn't hit him. Or hadn't hit him yet. Given the situations Harry encountered Snape in a worse mood -because to Harry, the man was almost always in a bad mood- , Harry expected a slap. Always. Or at least a slash, or a bruise.Snape only hurled his words.Once, they would have hurt. Now, Harry didn't think much of them anymore, considering them to be witty and smart more often than not."Suppose you're going to apologise, eh, boy?" Aunt Marge cut in, rising from the armchair, "Going to apologise to my brother? For what?" she released a mighty laugh, the sort of thing you'd expect from an animal, "It won't cut it, boy! Not for being a burden, not for a perfectly good family's suffering-""Not for ruining our reputation!" continued Uncle Vernon."And almost twelve years of you, an ungrateful brat who can't appreciate good intent. Out of the pure goodness in their hearts, they took you in! I'm telling you, Vernon," Aunt Marge pointed at Harry, her lips twisting in a vicious turn, "Something was always wrong with that boy. Bad blood, I say. Oh, I do not blame Petunia, of course," and she patted Uncle Vernon's shoulder to emphasize, "Turns up in the best of families, you know. If you remember Uncle Johnathan on our side-"The rest turned into a strain of rants about random family members Harry hadn't heard about, before the conversation somehow turned back towards Harry again."Of course, tainted with his father's blood as well. What did you say he did?"Uncle Vernon threw Harry a snide grin, "Unemployed."Harry blushed, feeling on the verge of tears while Aunt Marge threw her head back and laughed, hands cradling her stomach."Unemployed! And that Evans didn't have half the wit, running off with him-""Her surname was Evans?" Harry asked, clapping a hand over his mouth when Aunt Marge and Uncle Vernon both spared him a similar glance, their smiles cut right in half.Uncle Vernon was the first to react, however, shaking a fat finger in front of his face, "Listen, boy, you will not mention that woman in front of my presence. Do you understand?""But Aunt Marge talked about her first!""Hold your tongue, you brat!" Aunt Marge screamed, shaking her finger just like her brother was while Harry shrunk away, "Just like her, you are. Never liked her. Bad blood, I tell you. A rightful bitch-""No!" Harry shouted, his fingers tight over the jar, "My mother wasn't- wasn't whatever you just called her!"He took a deep breath, not able to bring himself to be guilty about his relatives' hurt pride."She was kind. She was beautiful. She had kind eyes, and silky black hair and-"Both Dursleys bellowed in laughter, slapping their knees and looking at each other before laughing even louder. Harry bit his lip, darting his eyes between the two, fear pooling inside him. It was horrifying, for reasons Harry didn't understand, to see them laugh as if he were wrong. As if he didn't know any better.The realization came swift and cruel, when Harry wasn't ready.Harry was afraid. Harry was confused.He wasn't afraid of Uncle Vernon or Aunt Marge.He was afraid, because for the first time in his life, Harry wasn't sure if the image he built of his parents' was true: whether his mother did have kind eyes, whether the elder Potter was employed. Whether on that cold, November day, they really had abandoned him out of poverty, burdening him on someone else.And whether he was wanted at all.Aunt Marge recovered first, wiping her eye clear of a tear. Shaking her head while she patted her brother's shoulder, who was now choking and coughing into his hand."A downright mess," Uncle Vernon managed in between coughs, a terrible screech emitting from his throat, "A mess, no doubt. But you better cut it out, boy. I don't want to hear another sound from you on the way back to Edwin."Both of them turned to walk to the door, an occasional whisper to each other sending them into a fit of laughter uncomfortable to watch or listen.Harry raised his head, suppressing a sob, and said very slowly and very clearly, braver than he had ever been, "I'm not going back."The whispers ceased, half-cut and comical. The way they turned to face him, however, was nothing to joke about. Uncle Vernon looked confused, which often was the only other expression he managed when he wasn't angry, and Aunt Marge looked like someone had landed a good kick to her precious (and rather vicious) dogs."What?""I'm-" Harry's voice cracked, but he hid it with a cough, "I'm not going back with you. Ever. Not when I've found-" but what was it that he had found, really? A home, a teacher? A Professor Harry had manipulated himself into liking because there wasn't anyone else to fit the trusted adult role he wanted? Harry hadn't found a home. He'd found a map. A map that made witty remarks when he took the wrong road, sure, but a map nonetheless. Harry raised his chin, lifting the jar for a better grip, "No when I've found somewhere I can feel safe. Mast- no, E-Edwin must have told you, but I have a debt to repay, or Professor Snape will report him, and he'll get arrested, and I'm-I'm sure that… You won't be safe, either, for selling me to work for him either."Uncle Vernon sputtered, his face paling, no doubt contemplating the notion of taking Aunt Marge by the arm and dragging her out of the shop, cursing the brat not to come back, ever. Then Harry would lock the door, slide down the glass, and, after Snape arrived, pretend nothing had ever happened.However, that wasn't to be.Though Uncle Vernon did sputter, taking hold of Aunt Marge's arm to lead her out of the shop, Aunt Marge wasn't as willing to comply. Briefly, he saw the confusion fade into anger. And then Aunt Marge was pouncing towards him.Harry wasn't sure what struck him as odd about the way Aunt Marge prowled towards him. But in the next second, instead of reacting the way he usually would (which would be to cower away and accept whatever was coming), the open jar in Harry's hands flew past his fingers, whirling in the air and-Collided with Aunt Marge.A few things happened in the following minutes, all in all in a bizarre, unfathomable sequence.Aunt Marge shouted out in pain, cradling her head, where the jar had hit without breaking, spilling ginger all over her, making Uncle Vernon catch the jar mid-fall and sweep her sister's clothes free of the spice. That didn't help in the least, though Harry found some amusement in it. It didn't last, though. Because afterwards, Aunt Marge sputtered, wiping her mouth and trying to rid herself of the spice that had fallen like snow over her jacket and shoulder, decorating her face with brown smudges.And then her skin started to burn.Well, not really, but Harry was well versed in rashes by now, and these were no different. Patches of red appearing like wild marks on her skin, Aunt Marge kept on screaming, wiping her eyes and mouth with the end of her shirt."WHAT DID YOU DO?" roared Uncle Vernon, running to her side and trying to help her to a chair beside the chimney, dropping the jar in the process, "WHAT DID YOU DO?""I don't know!" Harry shouted back, looking around the shop in panic. As if expecting something, or someone, to appear and handle the situation much better than Harry currently was. For Snape to appear, perhaps. Because the longer Aunt Marge screamed, flailing her arms, the more Harry thought that this really wasn't a normal reaction to ginger.Especially not, when Aunt Marge's back hit the chimney and her arms flung to the shelves, toppling jars shattering, the herbs and other prized materials showering down into a chaotic mess.That wasn't all that was broken.Like the shattered glass, Harry's defenses also shattered: the once familiar smell of Aunt Petunia's perfume blended with the cacophony of breaking glass and shouting adults, inciting a bolt of fear in Harry. Harry was no longer was in his cupboard, terrified. Terrified and angry because this shouldn't be fair. It couldn't be fair.Terrified because he was alone. Because it was all his fault. It burned, really, it did.Every thought he harboured on his side of the cupboard and the people that waited outside.The real chaotic heap, as he rocked on the hard floor, something oozing down his back and the throbbing in his bones that would never heal.Terrified. Guilty. Breathing hard and then not at all.He doesn't remember the slashes. The hits. Only feels the aftermaths, when he'd rather not feel at all. Because Harry Potter was an orphan. Harry Potter was a burden. Harry Potter was alone and abandoned, unloved, and he only had himself to blame.The intrusive thoughts were there, no matter how mindless Harry was when he left the shop, running outside. They were there, no matter how fast Harry sprinted.The sharp wind clashed with his skin, ripping his hair away from his face. The buildings around him whirled past in a single, dry colour. Nothing more than a musky background before the tall structures faded into smaller, dirtier piles in a smaller, dirtier street. Harry didn't stop there, either. He ran, ran, and ran. Pausing once or twice to either catch his breath or turn into an alley to escape an approaching stranger.The river greeted him when he escaped an alleyway, running down a bridge Harry couldn't remember the name of. Panting, Harry placed his hands on his legs, his throat burning and a stitch stabbing into his side.A few minutes later, Harry was dragging himself up the bridge that was abandoned for the night. No cars drove past, no horse came galloping down the road. No uncle Vernon dragged him by the neck, no Aunt Marge wrapped her thick hands around his fist. Only the river dared to make any noise, the stars veiled behind dark clouds, hiding the moon. A full moon.Harry stalked down the gravel, beside the columns and rails that looked down at the gushing waters below, black and senseless. A void, really, almost fantastical, now that Harry looked at it, his head in between the rails.He sighed, wiping his eyes and blinking furiously, trying to get rid of the tears. He wouldn't cry. He wouldn't give them that satisfaction, though they weren't watching. He wouldn't let anyone, even himself, see Harry Potter crying alone, by the bridge, contemplating whether he could survive a jump.Covering his face with his hands, he slid to the floor, pebbles rough under his new pair of shoes.New shoes. Harry stared, transfixed, running a hand down the sole. A smile, similar to the one he had when Snape had handed it to him, a size too big so he could wear it next year, growing on his lips. He hoped Snape wouldn't be too angry when he went back.When he went back? Harry took a mental step back. Would he be going back? Did he even dare? He didn't want to face the wrath of his Uncle and Aunt-Harry winced, shaking his head, a new flashback close to surfacing. He wouldn't think about it. Wouldn't ponder it. Harry was not going back. He'd find work elsewhere, not a chimney sweep this time, and send half of his wage to Snape to repay his debt, after which he would save some for his family, for Oliver, Marie-Lue and the others. He would buy a house, buy food and they would find happiness, not relying on prayers and adults any longer.Harry pushed himself away from the railing in new found motivation, feeling like for once, he could shoulder the world. Taking a deep breath, he turned on his heel, chest puffed out and took the first step down the shale.He did a double take when he heard a train puffing down the road.Harry's brows knit closer as he frowned, blinking multiple times in the direction of the puffing. Rubbing his chin, he tilted his neck for a better view, squinting in the direction of two blurry flames peeking through the darkness. Surely it couldn't be a train. His knowledge on the locomotives were scarce to none, but even Harry knew that no train could travel without rails or spew as little noise as this train did.Harry wouldn't deny his curiosity.The train was approaching, now, faster than any carriage or automobile Harry had seen on the road. Turning his body to the source, Harry began to walk, his parted lips tilting in a slight smile.At that moment, Harry thought he saw something out of the corner of his eye, along with a prickling feeling that he was being watched, but the bridge seemed deserted, and no light shone other than those of the train. On the other side of the bridge, the side he'd come from, came a single sound. Harry squinted, turning his head for a better view. He didn't stop walking, though. The shape grew in size, tall and lumpy. But Harry didn't have time to untangle what it was because the lump disappeared as soon as the train, which really wasn't a train, appeared, sending Harry toppling down to the floor with a yell.Harry winced, rubbing his arm, which he had flung to block his fall. A small throb ached on his side too, while the, well, giant automobile's puffing stopped, like a person holding their breath. Not only that, but the metal seemed to bend, as if it had run miles upon miles and now needed to take in deep breaths.One giant wheel stopped where Harry's feet had been seconds ago. They belonged, of course, to a violently purple train (Harry didn't know what else to call it, though he had seen something similar to this before, though horse-drawn), which had appeared out of thin air. Gold letters on the side spelled The Knight Bus. Ridiculous. What good would putting the K in front of night do if you had to read it as K-night?Harry wondered if the fall damaged more than his arm. Then a conductor leaped out of the bus and began to speak loudly into the night."Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency bus for the stranded persons. Just stick in your money, hop on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name-""What?" Harry said, bewildered, because there were more than a few things to be bewildered about. So while Harry pushed himself up, he began with the first of all his concerns."The Knight Bus?""That's what I've said. Now, my name-""But it starts with a K! How can it be read as night when it starts with K?"The man lowered the paper cards from where he was reading from and eyed Harry suspiciously."Who taught you how to read?"Harry frowned, "A professor."The conductor laughed, his voice echoing in the air, "Well, I'm no professor. I don't know myself, so don't ask me, but it is read as it is read. Ask your professor when you see him again.""I'm not seeing him again," Harry said, shuffling on his feet.The conductor shrugged, then eyed the pavement, "What were you doin' down there?""Fell over," said Harry."'Choo fell over over for?""I didn't do it on purpose," said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees on his new trousers were torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall had a nasty gash. Harry dusted himself with dismay, then turned to face the side of the bridge where the black shape had been. Nothing, of course, Harry noted with a sigh, inspecting his trousers again with a deep frown."'Choo lookin' at?" said the condutor.Harry stared at the man, then shook his head, "Nothing. So, you said you'd take me anywhere, did you?""That's what the Knight Bus is for," the conductor said, lifting his cards again, "My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this evening. Have any money on you?"Harry dug his hands into his pockets, surprised to find them both full. One had the key to the safe box. Harry dropped the key back inside with red ears, and lifted his other hand with the money Snape had told him to put inside the safe box, "Is this enough?"Stan took the money, counted some in his palm, and looked at Harry, "Depends. Where do you want to go?"Harry's shoulders fell. Where did Harry want to go? Somewhere to work, surely, but where was somewhere he could work while being safe? He looked up at Stan, his face shadowed, and asked him instead, "Somewhere I can work safely. Where people won't question me or where I've come from."Stan lifted a finger to scratch his hair under his cap. A moment later he clapped his hands, counted the money again. He pocketed some, and dropped the rest into Harry's palm."Welcome to the Knight Bus!" he declared, ushering him up the steps and into the bus, which, other than the compartment reserved for the driver, was just two rows of seats on each side, and a long, wide one at the very back. The seats weren't what was remarkable, though. It was the passengers. They lay on their backs and sides on wide, frail looking cushions with blankets draped over their bodies."No luggage?" asked Stan with an air of confirmation. Harry nodded and Stan led him to a seat right behind the driver, which looked to be the only empty seat among the fifteen or so. Harry noted that this row of seats were all occupied by men, while the other side only had women lining them."This is our driver, Ernie Prang. Ern, this is- eh, you never told me your name, dincha? Woss your name, kid?""Neville Longbottom," said Harry, saying the first name that came to his head. Snape hadn't used his name with the kind Professor Patel, afterall, and told him not to tell anyone anything about himself. Nevilles's name was unfortunate to come to mind because Mrs Augusta Longbottom had gone on a lengthy situation with Snape about her grandchild while buying his medicine, making Harry feel a little sorry for the boy, "So- so this bus," he went on quickly, hoping to distract Stan, "It goes anywhere? Anywhere?""Well, the distance is important, of course, and depends on how much time you have on your hands, but bother that, now," Stan said, shutting him up with a flick of his hand, "Diagon Alley, Ern. Take 'er away."Ernie, an eldery man wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his fringe. The two lights Harry had seen from a distance were glowing warmly on Ernie's side.The bus gave a hard jolt, then a BANG, before resonating with the familiar puffing Harry heard, and the bus was off, travelling on the gravel with speed Harry was not accustomed to. He had seen horseless carriages and automobiles, of course, and dreamt of riding one someday. But now, Harry would have preferred the horse carriage,the rows of seats sliding about as the bus flew down the road."How did you know I was stranded?" Harry asked Stan who now had a newspaper lifted to the light and read while shaking on his spot by the door."Didn't," Stan said, turning the page, the paper ruffling from the wind that whistled through the window of Ernie's compartment, "Passing by, and we saw you on the street, sort of lonely looking. Why?" he said, looking at Harry from above the papers, "Aren't you stranded?"Harry shrugged, lifting his head to look out through the window. Upon seeing nothing but black and dark, Harry looked back at Stan, "I think I am. But what about this Diagon Alley? Will I be able to work there? Without, well, you know," Harry grabbed his arms, licking his lips nervously, "Where I won't be pushed away because of my... skin color?""Happened a lot, that, did it?" Stan said, still turning another page with an airy tone that seemed to dismiss him entirely."Happened enough," Harry said, pulling his legs onto the seat and leaning on the window, some memories resurfacing. Harry cleaning himself up, parting his rowdy hair and dusting his clothes, presenting himself only to be turned away by one employer and the next. Soot was good, in that way. It tainted even the palest person black, and was a perfect disguise for one to walk in town without a second glance."There are those that stand against it. Those that kill others for it," Harry looked up with a horrified expression, "But Diagon Alley don't judge a man by the skin. Though with Black around, not many are keen on hiring strangers.""Black?" Harry repeated, sort of relieved, then squinted at the newspaper, "Is that the murderer that's walking around?""'Course he was, Neville. Where you been?"He gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry's face, removed the front page, and handed it to Harry.Harry took a single glance before holding it up for Stan, "I can't read in this light.""I reckon not, with those reading abilities of yours. You oughta read the papers more, Neville. Good practice," he shook his head, refusing to take the page back, "Already read it. I think you need it more than me."Harry muttered a thanks and folded the paper, fitting some of it inside his pocket, though half still protruded, "So how long until Diagon Alley?" Harry asked, still trying to stuff the page inside without ripping anything."Quite close, eh, Ern?""Ar," said Ernie darkly.Stan spun to face him, hands on the back of his head, "You weren't far, when we picked you up. Cut the fare down slim, dincha?"Harry blinked. Crossing his arms, he leaned his head on the hard back of the seat tiredly, the events of the night playing in his mind before Harry pushed them away, refusing to think about it, "Hope they have an inn, there. I'm exhausted.""You can get a few nights at the Leaky Cauldron," Stan said, patting his pocket where Harry's, well, Snape's money was, "A week, if you're lucky.""The Leaky what?""Blimey, Neville," Stan said, crossing the distance between them to flick him on the head, "You really hit your head, dincha?"Harry supposed he had. Closing his eyes, he leaned on the wood again, dozing off only to open them soon after when Ernie slammed his foot down and the bus skidded to a halt. Surprised no one had slipped down the seats, Harry pushed himself up, about to resume his sleep when Stan opened the door, "That's you, Neville," he said, and jumped down the steps, shivering and missing his jacket."Thanks," Harry said to both of them."You get your head checked, Neville," Stan said, and the bus rolled off again, puffing and flying down the road at a speed that still confused Harry.Turning around, Harry faced the front of a small, shabby looking pub. The Leaky Cauldron stood as dead as the night.Steering himself towards the entrance, Harry lingered there, debating whether to knock or not. He took a deep breath, gripped the door handle and pushed, leading the way to an interior that wasn't very different from the outside.The bell that chimed above him brought out a man from a door inside. He was holding a lantern, and when Harry walked forward, he saw the stooping figure of a man who was giving him a toothless grin, "Welcome, young man. Room for the night?""Uh, well, yeah," Harry said, nodding his head."Would you like to pay now, or in the morning?"Harry's shoulders sagged in relief. With a small smile, he nodded, "In the morning, please."The man nodded, walking to the door he had come in from, leaving Harry in the dark until he came back out, key in hand, "Come with me."Harry followed the man up a dingy, unstable set of wooden stairs that creaked at every step. Not trusting the railing, Harry balanced himself using the wall, sleep getting harder to fend off by the minute.At the first floor, the man turned right, stopping at the end of the corridor and slipping the key inside. The lock turned in a satisfying click, and the door opened to a dark, small room with an even smaller bed."Your room is number ten," the man said, pushing the key to Harry's hand.Harry stifled a yawn, his eyes burning, "Thank you, er-""Tom," the man said, his voice hazy in Harry's ears. Nodding, Harry walked inside, closing the door but not locking it. Instead, he threw himself onto the bed, not bothering with the blankets, and closed his eyes.Sleep came easily, that night.

Please note that the dates are deliberately written as such in the following chapter. It's wrong, yes, I know, but next chapter we'll learn why I have written as such. Thank you for reading. :)The next morning, Harry woke up exhausted.It felt like the Knight Bus was weighing his body down, burying him on the mattress by the bones. Harry opened his eyes, squinted at the sun filtering through the dusty panes, and turned his head to the other side. He would have turned his body, too, if his limbs didn't feel rock heavy and about to fall off. He tried to move the arm pinned under his weight, at least, and groaned. The bedframe groaned with him.Soon after, Harry opened his eyes again. He bared his teeth, both hands clenched into fists. He was tired. So very, very tired.Sleep was persistent in dismissing him.Fifteen minutes later, Harry finally managed to roll to his back, staring at the ceiling. Old pieces of wood ran down its length. A sour colour that seemed to be coated in several layers of dust. The room wasn't much different, either. Wooden floorboards, thin-looking walls, and horrible decor. Harry wasn't surprised to find himself missing his room at Snape's apothecary, with the warm coloured walls, the small work table and cushioned chair. Harry took some of the sheets in his hands, pinching the material between his fingers before dropping his hand down with a groan. Why had he run away? Why hadn't he just ignored his Aunt and Uncle? They couldn't break windows, surely, heavy fisted though they may be. Uncle Vernon was always deathly afraid of law enforcement. He'd even backed off when Harry mentioned Snape would report to the constables, dragging his sister with him until the ginger ruined everything.Harry hated ginger.Taking a deep breath, Harry pushed himself up. His feet landed on the floorboards with a dry thud, sending dust flying about, catching the sunlight. Another heave, and Harry was up - wobbling and flinging his arms about him until he caught his balance, resting his hands on the bed. Right, the bed. Harry took the cheap material in his hand, the rough fabric itchy on his skin and pulled it harshly. Dust came with it - a whirling storm that invaded his mouth and nose and sent Harry into an ugly coughing fit.Harry waved his hand in front of his face, trying to get rid of the dust and glared at the sheet once his coughing ceased."Right, then," he snapped, grabbing at the sheet one last time before starting to smooth them out with aggressive movements, dragging the creases with harsh pulls until he had a somewhat satisfactory look.Somewhat.Harry noted that it only made him feel guilty.He could do better than that. And he did. Three tries and some angry tears later Harry stalked to the door, grabbing the key and twisting it to the right. It didn't open. He tried again. No click came from the door. Cupping his head in his hands, Harry waited until he gained some composure before pulling the key off, number ten branded on its side and cupped the door handle. The door opened without a fight and Harry almost kicked the door as he walked out, this time locking it.The hallway on floor one was as he expected: ugly wood, worn out carpets and windows that could do with some cleaning. Harry didn't understand why the way the wood looked made him so anxious, as if any minute something was going to burst through and strangle him, so he kept his back hunched and his eyes glued on the patterns of the carpet - giant red and blue triangles that flowed down the rug in various directions, leading the path towards the staircase.He was about to walk downstairs, from which some vigorous noises were already rising, when he caught sight of himself in the mirror. Confused, Harry stepped back, his eyebrows knitting close together.He looked pathetic.The shirt was wrinkled, and so were the trousers. A visible fold ran down his leg and reached the cut on his knee. Harry's posture sagged at the sight of it. Lifting his eyes, however, Harry found that it wasn't the only bad thing about him. His hair (which was a bird's nest already on a good day) was simply rotten - crinkled, wild, lifting in random directions and not flattening when Harry pressed down.Harry peeked at both sides of the corridors, listening for approaching steps. When none came, Harry took a hesitant step forward before the mirrors and licked his fingers, combing through the wild strand, specifically the bangs over his scar. Aunt petunia had always warned him to keep those bangs down, screaming whenever she caught sight of-Harry shook his head, slapping his forehead. He wouldn't think about it. Not here.Bending down, Harry took out his shoes and pulled his socks up underneath his trousers before putting the shoes back on and buttoning them up. And finally, Harry smoothed out his shirt with his hands, rebuttoning them by the sleeves and collar until he looked at least a bit presentable. Not in front of Snape, no. The man would probably send him to his room, shouting behind him to fix himself up before he made a disgrace of himself.It was enough for the Leaky Cauldron, however. Dingy inn, dingy boy.Harry turned around and made his way down the stairs. The creaking wood sounded louder, somehow, even though Harry could make out much laughter coming from the entrance. Well, there shouldn't be much of a crowd, considering how this place was one of those that didn't judge a man by the skin, as Stan put it. He wasn't sure if he believed it. Harry chuckled, his feet touching the landing. Surely the people here couldn't be like him.And he was right.The people here weren't like him at all.They were everything and they were more.Harry's mouth hung open as he walked beside the counter to the eating area where seated at the tables were the most, well, un-normal people had ever seen.Men, women, children. All of them with skin tones Harry had never seen, ranging from a man paler than snow with even paler hair to a man black as the soot Harry used to clean. But not only that, there were people that wore blemishes and different colour patches on their skin, laughing along and talking to their companions as if this were normal. As if they were normal.Harry thought Snape was admirable to not abuse him based on his skin colour, and he had never brought it up, grateful Snape was willing to eat at the same table with him while most people loathed walking on the same street as him. But Harry had also thought Snape had some foreign descent, too, with the same narrow eyes that some strangers on the harbour had once or twice. A man had called them Asians just as Harry passed.Harry didn't ask Snape about it.But this scene at the inn? Harry couldn't stop staring as he walked to Tom who was behind the counter and serving a man with brown skin and clothes that were most obviously not of London, or even England.Eyes still wide, Harry didn't notice the man was calling for him until Tom patted his shoulder."What?" Harry turned, confused and a hand covering his mouth."You are here to pay the bill, young man?" Tom said, grinning and taking a notebook from under the counter, "Had a good rest?"Not entirely, but Harry gave him a smile. Not a forced one. It came as natural as the bewilderment he was still experiencing, "Uh, yeah, thanks," he said, pocketing his hands and searching for the coins in his pocket. A few things came out before that, though. The key to the safe box and the folded front page of the newspaper. In the light, Harry could now make out the newspaper's name as the Daily Prophet and some snippets of the photograph that no doubt belonged to Sirius Black."Uh, would this be enough?" Harry said, pushing the money forward. Tom counted the coins on the counter, murmuring under his breath until he took some portion back, "More than enough. How long are you going to stay, young man?"Harry looked down, toeing the bottom of the counter, "I'm not sure. Until I earn enough from a job.""Ah, where you working at?"Harry blushed, and mumbled quickly, "Haven't found one yet."Tom nodded, scratching his chin and taking a pen that was stranded on the counter, "Well, I'm sure you'll find some work in Diagon Alley. If not, you can always tend to some tables here for room and board. Pay me when you need to leave," Tom said, and pushed the remaining of the coins to Harry, opening his book and grinning down at him, "Deal?"Harry's face immediately lifted, a wide smile pulling at his lips, "Really?""Well, long as you don't steal," Tom said with a chuckle and leaned on the counter, "What's your name, young man?"Harry opened his mouth to answer, Neville's name on his lips before he closed it again. He didn't like the idea of lying to Tom, after his kindness."Harry," he finally said, settling for a half-truth."Just Harry?" Tom said, lifting the pen over a page.Snape's warning came to mind again."No, uh, I'm Evans. Harry Evans," he said beaming, and instinctively flattening his bangs, "Harry Evans.""Harry… Evans," Tom repeated, writing the name down, the pen scratching the paper in rough, fast strokes, "I'll have breakfast ready for you, Harry. You just wait on a table. Anything you can't eat?"Harry raised a brow, thinking of what he meant before he nodded vigorously."Nothing with ginger, please."Breakfast, which consisted of sausages, bread, and a warm cup of milk, Harry opened the newspaper Stan had given him and laid it out on the table he was sharing with a couple, smoothing the crinkles on the page.Sirius Black's photograph glared at him, mouth open in a scream. Harry couldn't hear him, of course, but he still had the impression that he could catch his voice in the distance, his rage echoing inside the cell he was being held in by a number of hands.Harry shuddered. Dropping his fork, Harry pushed his plate away and pulled the paper closer, reading along with his finger.BLACK STILL AT LARGESirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry confirmed today. "We are doing all we can to recapture Black," said Minister Cornelius Fudge this morning, "and we beg the community to remain calm." Fudge has been criticized by some members of the Court and High Council for informing the foreign embassies of the crisis."Well, really, I had to, don't you know," said an irritable Fudge. "Black is mad. He's a danger to anyone who crosses him, British or not. I have their assurance that they will tread carefully on the matter, including word of Black's alliances. And let's face it — we're not the only ones that are in danger." While it has been told that Black is carrying multiple revolvers, the community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black murdered thirteen people with a single explosive. Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry didn't think it was possible to look so dead while alive but Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like a corpse."Scary looking thing, isn't he?" a waiter said, picking up Harry's empty plate and mug, "That Sirius Black?""He murdered thirteen people?" said Harry, holding the page to the waiter, whose face on one side was terribly burnt, "just like that?""Oh, yes," the waiter said with a one sided frown, the burnt side of his face deathly still, "Best to be careful outside, lad. If he did it in broad daylight, with witnesses and all, God alone knows what he'll do next."And then the waiter left, squeezing himself through the tables to the back of the shop.Harry watched him disappear behind a swinging door before he turned to the page, looking for more articles to read, when the man in front of him spoke."I heard Black was a big supporter of You-Know-Who," he said. Lifting his head, Harry saw a black man who was wearing a brimless, cloth cap looking down at the article and pointing at Black's picture with a finger, "Very close to His ranks."Harry tilted his head and glanced back at the drawing, trying to decode what the man had said."You-Know-Who?" Harry repeated, turning the page over to its front, finding the title awfully hilarious, and would have laughed if not for the situation,"Uh, who's You-Know-Who?""You don't know?" the woman beside the man asked in a monotonous voice, a hand adjusting her head wrap before continuing in the same toneless way while the man pulled on his jacket, "That's very odd."Harry was beginning to think that all his life, he was kept out of a secret that he was meant to know. Irritated, he pressed his lips together and crumpled the page into uneven folds, "Well, why don't you tell me, then?" he snapped, immediately feeling guilty when the man's eyes widened in surprise while he stood up, reaching for some sticks that were leaning on the table with crescent shapes on each end."Uh, sorry, I'm really sorry," Harry said, rubbing his neck, "I'm having a bad few days.""Completely understandable," the woman said, again toneless, adjusting her blouse as well as a necklace which had two triangles intervening to make a star at its end, "I'm having a bad day myself."The man chuckled and handed the sticks to her. The woman threw her legs over the bench and took the sticks from the man. Standing up, she positioned the crescent shapes under her arms and walked around the table, so now Harry could see that she only had one foot under her green dress, making Harry blush around the ears in shame."He was a bad man, an evil man that hated those that weren't him, and killed those who dared oppose him and his ideologies."Though Harry processed the words, he wished she wouldn't say it as though she was talking about the weather. The man behind the woman shuddered, shaking his head with a grim frown, "A serial killer, more likely. He campaigned his ideologies, spread it around those with similar views and began a ranging terror in Britain, killing coloured, disabled, and non-Christian folks.""I heard he killed many children, as well. Leaving them with scars on their foreheads before setting their houses ablaze. Horrific."Harry's heart suddenly stopped and his mouth went dry, no longer caring if the woman's voice was monotone. Reaching a hand, Harry touched his own forehead, the words echoing inside his head like blaring sirens.No, it couldn't be. He did have a scar, and parents whose house burnt down, which led them to abandon their son (Harry's heart gave a twisted, painful wrench), but he was alive now. He was alive. He wasn't dead, like all those children."But you can be happy, lad," the man said, readjusting his jacket with a hearty grin, "Today's the anniversary of his death.""What?""He died thirteen years today, thanks to the Boy-Who-Lived."You-Know-Who, Diagon Alley, the Knight Bus, the Leaky Cauldron? And now the Boy-Who-Lived? If Harry wasn't as shocked as he was now, he would have laughed in confusion, demanding to know who had come up with such names. As of now, however, his head was starting to hurt and a horrible wave of fear was starting to trickle up his body, a painfully heavy, foul wave."You can find some books in Diagon Alley, lad, I don't doubt it," the man said, lifting the woman's bag from the bench, "Just look for the library and ask for a copy of Recent Local History, volume two.""Poor child," the woman said, her toneless voice breaking silently and rather painfully, "Survived You-Know-Who but went missing soon after. I do hope he's happy now, though. Happy and laughing somewhere," turning to Harry, she gave him a swift wave, "Well, goodbye, then."The man nodded at Harry, and turned to follow the woman's lead, balancing the heavy bag on his right arm.Harry blinked, looking down at the crumpled page in front of him. With sudden realization, he ripped it open once more, creating an ugly tear in the middle while he searched for the publishing date.July 30, 1874.His heart almost thudded to a stop before pumping fast in Harry's ears, because if that was yesterday's date, then today was July 31st. The anniversary of You-Know-Who's and the Boy-Who-Lived's apparent death.It also happened to be Harry's birthday , which he had forgotten with the events of yesterday.Still not believing what had happened and with far more questions than ever, Harry made a sudden turn, snatching the newspaper with a jolt and stumbled after them, almost tripping twice and bumping into various people and furniture multiple times, "Wait!"The couple turned around, as well as some people around them. Harry ignored them, though he still felt anxious from their stares, but focused on the bewildered confusion on the man's face, "What was his name?""Who's, lad?""The Boy-Who-Lived!" Harry said, throwing his arms up, his faced flushed, "Who else-""Harry Potter," the woman said, toneless, staring at him with hollow eyes.Harry's shoulders fell, the paper floating to the floor in a defeated sort of way."What?""The Boy-Who -Lived. His name was Harry Potter."Harry would have found it easier to focus if he hadn't heard all of this information. And for that reason alone, he had taken to his room almost immediately to clear his mind before giving up entirely and deciding to enter Diagon Alley to find the previously mentioned book and any information on his new situation.Walking out the door at around two in the afternoon, Harry found that he was somewhat glad Snape hadn't disclosed much of his past. Though to be fair, he wouldn't have believed the man if he had. It still sounded atrocious while he walked to the back of the inn which led to the Alley, a sort of lie these people had bought up. Because if he really was Harry Potter, a famous Boy-Who-Lived, why didn't everyone else he met during these thirteen years recognize him? Why was Snape the only one to recognize him by face and not name? Shaking his head, Harry crossed the distance between him and the door, lifting his head to get a better look at it.It wasn't a big door, Harry thought, staring at the handle on the dark wood. Windowless and of much better quality than the rest of the inn, spiral patterns carved along its length. Nothing admirable.Taking a deep breath, Harry pulled the handle down and pushed.The bright sun hit him in the eye unexpectedly, making him gasp. Squinting, Harry held up a hand to shield his face, blinking to get rid of the light that was now flashing in his vision.Momentarily blind, Harry was left amidst waves of noise that came from all directions. Laughter, excited talk and the general sound of the public, all with an air of a celebration. And as his vision eventually returned, Harry swore he could hear some instruments coming from the distance.If Harry was taken aback by what he had seen inside the Leaky Cauldron, nothing could match the surprise he had received once stepping into the busy streets of Diagon Alley. And if he hadn't heard what the couple said, he might have enjoyed it far more.On a narrow road squashed between rows of stalls and shops, were people of all shapes and sizes, some much, much taller than Harry, while some could only come up to his waist. Exactly like how it was inside the Leaky Cauldron, the people here also had skin colours of various tones and shades, some of which were dressed in clothes that Harry had never seen before.Harry took a step forward and started to make his way through the street, dodging people while trying to look for a help-wanted sign on a shop, a wide, lopsided smile on his face. He wished desperately to carve this moment into his head, to forever have this moment of absolute joy and happiness, with all its colours, sounds, and emotions.Harry moved through the crowd, dodging people left and right while also keeping an eye out for the library. He wasn't really in the mood for asking anyone about it, understandably. Who would be able to approach anyone knowing they were some sort of missing idol that everyone supposedly knew? Harry didn't care if these people here looked approachable, and would most definitely not judge him. He was going to make sure no one in Diagon Alley learned about him.Sidestepping a few people seated in chairs with wheels (chairs with wheels!) and some other people that used the sticks the woman in the shop had, Harry finally found himself in front of a bookshop. Squinting at the name, Harry lowered his gaze to the window in defeat. Too blurry. But the writing on the glass -painted white over a red crest- spelled Flourish and Blotts. Well, he had some idea how to spell that, at least. Rubbing his hands together, Harry stepped over to the door and pushed.The door opened into a shop, which, except for the bookshelves that reached the ceiling, was unremarkable in every way. Harry closed the door behind him, flattened his bangs and walked to the empty counter. Well, the almost empty counter. Harry could barely see the other side with the stacks of books piled on the surface.He could, however, make out a bell between two tall piles. Wedging his hands between them, he managed to ring it twice, almost toppling the piles when he tried to take his hand back.A few moments later, Harry heard footsteps coming from the other side of the shop. He couldn't see the owner, the virtue of the books and his height, but when the man spoke, he could make out the odd lisp in his voice."Welcome to Flourish and Blotts. How may I help you?""Uhm," Harry rubbed his neck, feeling foolish about asking a bookshop owner for directions to the library, "I was wondering if you could tell me where the library is.""Ah, no matter, my young friend. Just turn right from here and when you see the Healer Shop, turn left and you'll find yourself there in no time. May I ask what book you're going to read, out of curiosity?""Recent Local History, volume two.""Ah," the man said in a voice that sounded defeated, "Well, doing some reading to honour the day?"Harry licked his lips and shrugged his one shoulder, "You could say that.""Well, have a good day, my young friend."The footsteps retreated to the back of the shop, and Harry left the shop soon after, running the directions in his mind.The Healer shop wasn't far. In fact, Harry found it not long after and took the left, which also led to the library in no time at all.But upon seeing what the library looked like, Harry couldn't help but be a little disappointed. He was expecting something grand. Something huge. Maybe with marble and pillars and statues. But instead, the shop was a two story, red-brick building with a dingy sign that looked like it was leaning a bit too much to the left, as if a powerful wind had bent it to the point of almost collapsing.Harry wrinkled his nose and dragged himself to the door.It opened with some struggle, the bottom of the door dragging on the red carpet. Harry pushed it open with his whole weight, his back to the door and the heels of his shoes digging into the carpet.Harry closed it behind him with equal trouble. A drop of sweat fell down his forehead. Wiping it with his sleeve, Harry moved to the small, round counter where a woman was resting her head with multiple mugs surrounding her pool of long, black hair.Harry avoided looking directly at the woman, and instead focused around the shop. This was a much better setting than Flourish and Blotts, with a space that looked wider than the prior shop and smelled more musty and cardboard-like than dust and old paper.The smell worsened as Harry stepped closer, and he realized it was coming from the empty mugs around the woman, including one that held some still, brown liquid."Excuse me," Harry said, a little over a whisper.The woman didn't stir, of course, so he tried again. This time louder."Excuse me, Ms?"No response.Harry shuffled his feet, and decided to find the history section on his own.He didn't, of course. But he did find some interesting titles he would like to read, as well as sections that tempted him rather too much, specifically the one on the second floor dedicated to basic school knowledge.At the end, Harry came shuffling back, glaring at the woman's head which still hadn't moved. This was becoming rather irritating.Lifting his hand, Harry touched the woman's scalp, and gave it a few pokes, "Excuse me!"The woman's head lifted lazily. Harry clenched his hands into fists behind him before scratching his arms with his nails, which were starting to grow rather long.The woman finally looked up, but she might as well not have bothered, with the dark, dark bags surrounding dead, cold eyes. Gulping, Harry dropped his arms and cleared his throat, hand in front of his mouth, "Hello.""What do you want?"Well, Harry could work with that."History section. I'm looking for Recent Local History, volume-""Of course you are. Second floor, far left corner, nudged between languages and geography. Now stop bothering me."And taking the half-empty mug, she threw it back in one gulp, a momentary smirk on her lips before her head plopped down on the table with a dull thud.Harry knew he wouldn't be bothering her, again. Confused and rather freaked out, he marched up the stairs behind the round counter, wandering to the far left corner. Sure enough, the section was there, rather small, compared to the other genres in the library.Harry ran his fingers along the thick spines, searching for the right once before his hand landed on a tattered copy of the book.A satisfactory smile widened on his lips as he pulled the book out. The book wasn't in good condition, but it was enough for Harry. He'd just have to be careful to not damage the emerald-green cover, though it wouldn't make any difference, seeing as the cover was a few days away from falling off.Not bothering with a chair or table, Harry laid the book on the floor and swiftly turned the pages. There was a table of contents, which he let out a mighty laugh at seeing, and ran a finger down the table to finally come across what he was looking for right at the bottom. Beneath it was a list of events Harry couldn't care about, so skipping it, he instead focused on the parts that involved him.1854-1865 (pg 100)Lord Voldemort (also known as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, You-Know-Who and Lord Thomas Marvolo Riddle), and His and the Death Eaters' Campaign and Reign.The (Assumed) Death of You-Know-WhoThe Potters and the Suspected OrderHarry James Potter, the Boy-Who-LivedHarry closed the book. He wouldn't be able to finish this book now, with said contents taking up almost half the book. Standing up, Harry pressed the book under his arm and marched down the stairs.He did try to wake the woman again, to no avail, so with some hesitation, he started to walk to the door, clutching the book with a silent promise to bring it back and left the library, rather nervous as he walked back to the Leaky Cauldron.He didn't look anywhere else until he reached the inn, and even there he ran up the stairs without disturbing Tom.The path down the corridor seemed longer, somehow, as though someone had stretched it in his absence.When he finally reached the door, Harry plucked the keys from his pocket with shaking hands, fumbling with them while his eyes looked from one side to the other, heart thumping fast and unsteady, until the door opened and Harry dived in. He slammed the door behind him, locking it twice and leaned on the wood, breathing hard - hard and unsteady, until he was able to calm down.Releasing a deep breath, Harry lifted his head. The book felt heavy in his hands. Heavy, as though he was carrying a grown man and not a 300 page book. He pushed away from the door, walking to the bed briskly.The book laid still on his bed. Still and foreign, like it shouldn't have been there. Harry tried to tell himself that he wasn't stealing. That he was going to take the book back, eventually, and he was only borrowing it. It didn't stop him from approaching it with timid hands, though. He bit the inside of his cheek while his hands ruffled the pages to where he wanted to read.The Potters and the Suspected Order, black and bold, blinked at him on the page, almost mocking him. All this time, Harry had begged for some sort of information about his parents, about his past, and all this time, it was written inside a published book.Absolutely mocking.Harry shook his head, trying to get rid of the hollow feeling in his chest. Because this book, right here, could potentially be the evidence that his parents hadn't abandoned him at all, and died in that fire instead.Harry wasn't sure which option he preferred more, but when he started to read, it didn't matter anymore.James Potter and Lily J. Potter (née Evans)...James and Lily. How suiting. How lovely. How just like them, to have beautiful names.Harry felt the tears flow down, but didn't stop them. Instead, he pulled his legs to his chest and lowered his head into his arms, sobbing uncontrollably, his choking gasps making it harder to breathe.Harry cried. Harry cried hard.Because for the first time in his life, Harry Potter could finally, truly mourn for his mother and father.

Mild tw for unintended self-harm.Thank you all for your reviews!It took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never before had he been able to get up or eat whenever he wanted. He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating shops in the world, it wasn't very hard to wander off to the outside world.This freedom also came with certain aspects he didn't quite fancy. For one, he was utterly miserable for reasons he couldn't understand. He usually couldn't sleep at night, and so he would irritably toss from one side to the other, scream into his pillow and cry himself to sleep.Most nights he couldn't sleep long enough, disturbed as he was by nightmares. Those nights he hated the world more than anything else.He just couldn't understand why he was feeling like this. Guilty, angry, afraid at the same time, breaking down at minor inconveniences as though he was carrying the world on his shoulders.Then again, he probably was.Due to his pathetic sleep patterns, Harry woke up at eleven or noon, depending on how the night had gone, and tossed in bed for a while before getting ready for the day.He'd snuggle under the sheets not long after, inducing him to pull Recent Local History, volume two (which was written by Alenxandria Alexander) from under his bed and read for the next two hours, until around two in the afternoon. Then he'd have a lovely crying session, in which he'd rather avoid the wooden walls in the corridors, before dragging himself outside, head down, feeling entirely numb.But that wasn't all Harry was up to.He still had to save money, if he ever hoped to achieve some stability, and tending to the tables at the Leaky Cauldron would only get him dinner and sleep, if he was lucky. Harry wasn't stupid. Diagon Alley was the most resourceful option he had, with many, many shops to choose from.To work for.To learn all and any information the adults might have on the Boy-Who-Lived.He avoided the tinsmith, which was right beside the entrance, and wavered between avoiding the apothecary or not. The woman would certainly ask where he'd gotten his experience, small though it may be, and if he even uttered Snape's name, he was sure she wouldn't wait a second before writing a letter to assess his abilities. No, best to avoid it entirely.He decided to ask Florean Fortesque for work at his parlour, because he had offered Harry some ice cream -free of charge!- after catching him making his rounds in the Alley, back hunched, rather depressed. The ice cream was like magic. Sugary, savoury and all the words that meant pleasant pulled into one. He almost dared to ask for more, when his bowl was finished, but instead thanked the man very sincerely before leaving the shop to head to another.The rest of the shopkeepers at Diagon Alley weren't so bad, Harry thought. Sure, that one shop that sold the most expensive articles of clothing had a very rude owner, but he'd have no problem avoiding her. Or the library.And so, in the one week Harry spent at Diagon Alley, he learned many great things.He learned how to serve ice-cream, how to clean books, how to sew clothes that needed mending…He also learned no one actually knew what had happened thirteen years ago to the Boy-Who-Lived or Voldemort.The couple had said Voldemort had died on his birthday, Alexandria Alexander said it happened on a cold, Halloween night.Tom said Harry Potter was dead, while Harry Potter wiped the counter in front of him with a wet rag and a grin.The woman at the second-hand clothes store who said she was from Thailand and called herself Fah was persistent that nothing of the sort had happened at all.The owner of Flourish and Blotts guaranteed that Lord Riddle and Voldemort were two different personalities entirely.Harry got some enjoyment out of watching these adults. Almost every customer had a different version of the tale, and almost none of them had read Alenxandria Alexander, but Harry could understand why. He had to shut the book himself when Alexander began to talk about a 'dark angel' that had come to tell her the truth about the night the Potter's had died. For a history book, Harry thought the book was very much subjective. And very much dependent on this angel she called her muse.But if there was anything Harry knew was correct, it was that close to his presumed death, Voldemort had turned far more nasty. As though attacking minorities and trying to push bills that would ensure the supremacy of native citizens were not enough, he opted to murder not soon after - murder of the children of families that weren't 'normal'.He'd invade homes, attack parents, if not killing them, and use a knife to carve their foreheads in lines of scars, after which he'd leave them in the house which his followers would set on fire.Until the night he attacked the Potter household.The book had given a very vivid description of the particular topic.Harry shut the book the minute things started to turn ugly, and didn't get out of his room for two days.Those two days, he cried more than he had ever before, flashbacks, nightmares, and the eventual numbness that came from refusing to think about it.That is, until this morning.A prickling sensation rippled on Harry's arm. He hadn't realised he had picked up the habit of scratching his arms until he felt a jab of pain on his skin. With a groan, Harry twisted his arm for a better look, wincing and staggering back when he caught sight of the red, bleeding line running down his skin.For a moment, he stared, petrified and curious. The blood was pooling on his skin, dark red and warm. So warm. He would have stood transfixed in his own shock, no doubt, if the blood didn't start dripping to the bedsheets and floor.With a gasp, he jumped to his feet, staring wide eyed at the red trail following him, heart thumping loud and angry. He rushed to the door, closed it and didn't bother locking it behind him. Running down the corridor with his head down, as to avoid the menacing doors, he didn't notice the man that was walking towards him until he collided with his shoulder and tumbled to the floor, scratching his arm on the carpet. With a hiss, he pushed himself up, cradling his now burnt and bleeding arm."I'm sorry," he cried to the man, struggling to find his balance, "I'm so sorry, but I'm in a rush!"And without looking at the man, he rushed down the stairs."Tom!" he shouted into the inn, still cradling his arm, head spinning with bright, small dots, "Tom!" he tried again, leaning against the counter, one hand flying over his mouth to stop a gag.Tom walked out the door that led to the kitchens, mortified. It didn't compare to the expression he showed upon seeing Harry's arm, however, confused between a fusion of horror and shock."Harry! What on Earth happened to you?""I- Small accident, you see, I read this thing and-" Harry's started, his words ceasing abruptly. Tom looked at him furrowed brows, his hands held open in front of him, "Harry?""Nevermind. I just need… I just need- are there any doctors in Diagon Alley?"Tom scratched his forehead, silent for far too long. Harry licked his lips and lifted a hand, shaking him by the shirt, "Tom! Doctor?""Ah!" Tom jumped, rather clumsily, due to his age and nodded vigorously. He knew the answer, no doubt, and wasted no time blurting out in a jumble of words, "Healer, on the left side, very close to Gringotts, right before you turn into Knockturn Alley. Does her work free of charge-""Great," Harry said, squeezing his shirt sleeve over his stinging arm, biting back a wince as the fabric smoothed over his arm, digging into the cut. The metallic smell was becoming nauseating by the time Harry turned to the back door, Tom's and the customers' eyes on his back, and he'd rather find this healer before he delayed anymore."I will send Yanase with you," Tom said, turning to the kitchens to find the waiter with the burnt face, "Yanase!"But Harry had thrown himself out the door the moment Tom had turned his back, blending into the busy street of Diagon Alley, arm clenched to his chest.He received a few queer looks. Most of them were concerned, some of them reluctantly so, and Florean gave him a wave, spoon in hand, which Harry returned with a vague smile. The pain was growing from a throb to spasms of pain, now, and the jostle of the crowd resembled ugly screeching in his ears.Eyes still down, Harry dodged the crowd ambling down the street, trying to keep as much to the right as he could. The pain, vibrating up and down his arm, was growing heavier and heavier. But with it, Harry felt something else. Something equally, if not more terrifying than the pain, because Harry felt alive. Strong, stable and controlled. The cut had been a mistake, yes, but in a way, it felt like the anchor Harry was searching for.He reached the Healer, while lost in his thoughts. The outside isn't much different than the rest, but is adorned with colourful paint that circles the white walls. There are only two small windows which are too high to reach, and a lonely wooden sign that reads Healer at the very top.Harry doesn't immediately trust it. The shop has a cheap feel to it - built from items discarded on the streets and painted to look defeatedly pleasing to the eye.Harry's arm gives another throb. This time, he turns back, deciding to tend to it himself. He only needs to take a single step to see Yasane, the waiter, walking towards him, parting his way awkwardly through the crowd with his pole-like body.Harry's posture sags and his head hangs down. Defeated, he steals a glance at the shop, then a glance back at Yasane and the crowd. He doesn't give Yasane enough time to reach him. Turning around, pebbles crunching under his shoes, Harry steps over the sidewalk and pushes the wooden door open.The strong waft of smells are immediately there to greet him. Herbal smells, they are. Minty and sharp inside the hot, suffocating air. For a moment, Harry imagines that this is what Snape's laboratory would look like. Shelves upon shelves are packed tightly with jars, while bubbling and boiling noises come from somewhere in the room. And hot. So very hot. Harry fumbles with his shirt, casting his eyes away from the phials on the shelves and steps to the front counter.There isn't a healer in sight, nor a bell to announce Harry's arrival. Instead, Harry finds a small, crystal ball and stacks of cards. Lifting a hand, Harry touches the ball, running a finger down the glass surface. It's cool, almost cold, and when Harry lifts his head to look at the door, he feels refreshed.Behind him, Yasane steps in, closing the door behind him. He smiles at Harry, back hunched because the ceiling is too low and dodges the ornaments and plants hanging from the ceiling to come closer to Harry."The healer isn't here?" he asks, looking like he'd rather be somewhere else.Harry gives him a similar look before eyeing his arm, "No," he mumbles, then looks behind the counter where a curtain parts the way between this room and the next, where the boiling noises were coming from, "Reckon we should, I don't know, go in there?"Yasane shuddered, despite the heat, and shook his head, "No. I- I don't want. Very unpleasing, I think. Wait here?"Harry shrugs, leans against the counter, and waits.Five minutes pass. Then ten. At the end of fifteen, when he can barely lift his arm, he storms around the corner towards the curtain, brows knitted tight and a scowl in his face."Evans! Evans wait-"He doesn't listen to Yasane and is about throw back the curtains himself when the healer finally comes out.Harry stumbled back, gasping. He tries to catch a look of the woman, at least, before he can stagger back but craning his neck only puts him in an awkward situation where he's falling again, flailing his arms.Holding out his uninjured arm, Harry tries to cut his fall, reminded rather hastily of the night with the Knight Bus. He doesn't fall this time, however. Doesn't feel the pain from the fall last time. He feels something much, much worse. A seizing pain that rivals almost anything he's felt that month. Well, almost.The woman's grip on Harry's arm doesn't falter when he cries out in pain. Without looking at the women, he tries to pry the fingers from around the cut, eyes tearing up. However, the woman's vice grip stays firm, and furthermore starts to drag him through the curtain to the other room."You!" she shouts suddenly, stopping mid-stride to point at Yasane, who points at his chest in surprise, "Yes, you! Go away, umfana, I will be alone with my patient."Yasane swallows heavily, eyes darting between the two, weighing his options before Harry nods his head, wiping some of the tears trailing down his burning cheeks.The woman's eyes follow Yasane until he's out the door. With a gentle thud, the door closed behind him and only after the woman saw Yasane walking past the window did she drag him to the back of the shop, her hold far more gentle and pushed him to the corner where he stood a long, wide bed."Sit," she ordered.Harry did, and upon her gaze, lifted his arm, bloody and wet under the also red shirt.The woman tutted and shook her head. Taking Harry's arm in her hands, she looked up at him with soft eyes before motioning his armIt took Harry an embarrassingly long time to understand that she was asking for permission. Harry blushed and nodded vigorously. A soft smile found her lips before they closed into a stern look. Her fingers, long and square, gripped the sleeve of Harry's shirt and slowly started to peel it away from the cut.Harry tried hard to not wince, to not make any noise. His lips pressed into a firm, straight line, biting the inside of his cheek and gripping the sheet under him in a tight fist. Then, it was over.The woman turned Harry's arm, lifting it to the light that was coming in from the window. She must have seen something Harry could not, the way she suddenly sprang to her feet and passed the boiling pots in the middle of the room towards the shelf on the other side, eyes scanning the shelves.Harry took this moment to observe the woman further. Her black skirt with beads layered on top of each other until they met with a shawl draped over her chest. Harry couldn't see much of her hair, but just beside her round red earring, he could just make out some black shapes over her dark skin before that, too, was hidden by a hat with a round brim on the top.The woman turned around and began to stride towards him, a few jars in hand. She bent down beside the table next to the bed, the jars perfectly lined up, and went back to the shelf before coming back with an odd bag with stripes.She pulled open the latch on the bag, and lifted out some small, white, soft looking balls and dropped them on the table as well. Standing up for the third time, she circled the room towards the fireplace and picked up onc of the many buckets beside it. She heaved it with no difficulty, and Harry presumed it to be lightweight until she placed it on the floor, pulling its lid. Harry bent over, catching the glimpse of water before he was pushed back by the shoulder."No," the healer simply said, bending down and reaching under the bed, arms coming back with a wide wooden bowl. Balancing the bowl on the bed, she took hold of his arm again and held it above the bowl, dipping the rag that was hanging on the belt she was wearing into the bucket, she gave it a tight squeeze before starting to clean the cut on Harry's arm. It stung. With every stroke, Harry winced and received a tight-lipped frown from the woman.Once that was done, and the water that had fallen on the basin was a murky colour, the healer moved onto the jars. Taking one white ball into her hand, she dabbed it inside one of the bigger phials, continuously, until it took the colour of the liquid, and once more, Harry's arm began to sting. Harsher, this time, and the feeling lingered even when the healer began to spread a balm over his cut."Hurts?" the healer asked, pushing the jars aside and balancing the bag on the bed."Uh, yes, but it's better now," Harry said, flexing his fingers and turning his arm around, "Thank you."The healer gave a stern nod of approval, but a hint of a smile grew on her lips at the concern still knitted on Harry's face. Lifting a roll of bandages, she unwrapped the fabric, the ends pooling on her skirt. Harry offered his arm before she asked for it. With another nod, the healer gently wrapped it around his arm, circling it slowly and steadily, and finally clipping it to place with a needle.Harry lifted his arm to his line of sight, flexing his fingers and running his free hand over the bandage. The material, rough to the touch, felt soft from the inside. Softer than his shirt, at the very least, because Harry didn't feel any itching from his cut."Thank you," he said to the woman, dropping his arm with a smile, "I would have liked to offer something, but I heard you do this for free. Thank you for that, as well."The healer nodded. Kneeling beside the table, she started to pack away her materials, stuffing the extra balls and bandages into her bag and lidding the jars close. Harry, not sure of what to do, jumped down from the bed, one hand still on the wooden frame. He stood still, observing the healer. Oddly reminded of Snape, when he took the time to help him from a nightmare or when he had fallen, always smelling like one herb or the other. But here, while the dominant smell was sharp and minty, Snape had the sort of smell that was nutty and bitter, close to ginger but not quite.Oh, ginger.Harry didn't know if ginger had any healing properties, but he was thankful the healer hadn't used it all the same.Rubbing the back of his nape, Harry faced the healer, smile lopsided, "So, um-" he clasped his hands in a firm clasp, "What's- If it's alright, can I learn your name."The healer turned, sharp and precise. She looked like Harry had just emitted an abominable screech in her shop, eyes wide and lips slightly parted. A flash of recognition passed over her eyes, however, and she recovered from her shock quickly. She cleared her throat. Her hands slid down her skirt to smooth the fabric while she stood up before her hands landed on her hips, "I am healer.""But what's your name?""My name is Uluthando, umfana."Harry tilted his head, "What does 'umfana' mean?""You don't know?" the healer asked, stern lips loosening into a smile."Of course I don't know!" Harry cried, throwing his arms into the air, "The words I know are only in English. You should speak English with people in this place.""Why? This is my shop. You come to me."Harry lifted his brow, scratching the side of his neck before his mouth opened in understanding. Wide and an almost perfect 'o'."You're right. Of course you should be able to speak your own language," he said, red in the cheeks, "I understand now, I'm sorry."The healer nodded. She lifted her fingers, then, from her lips to her face and Harry stared confused until she pulled at the sides of her lips, showing neat rows of teeth."Smile."Not being able to help himself, Harry laughed, doubling over, his own hand covering the grin on his face, "You're right," he managed to say, lifting his head, "A smile is enough."The healer herself escorted Harry to the door, casting warning glances to his arm in a way that suggested that she didn't want to see him here on injury related business. Harry could work with that, and she made sure to let her know with an overly enthusiastic nod and salute. With another nod from the healer, Harry dropped his hand. Transitioning the salute into a wave, he turned left, the opposite direction of the Leaky Cauldron. He didn't think he had the nerve to face Tom yet.He passed the library with his head down, trying to be as small and invisible as possible, though how that was possible with his bloodied sleeve and bandaged arm he wasn't so sure. Nonetheless, the street led him to a small bank and a few shops scattered on its sides. Nothing interesting, particularly, but in the corner of his eye, something did flicker. It stood out from the rest, because of the polished wooden walls and the name on the board over the door that didn't explain much about what the shop sold."Ollivanders?" Harry muttered. He stole a glance to the people around him, to see if anyone was walking to this lonely little shop. No one, not a single stray soul. So Harry decided to be that soul instead.Ollivanders had no large windows, either. Only a measly door squeezed between two panes of glass. Approaching the door, however, Harry realized that they weren't just windows, but colorful, patterned glass. One looked to be made by a professional, depicting a woman carrying a bucket, while the other was only shapes distorted into looking acceptable in a very short amount of time. Harry slid his hands down the one with the woman. He smiled, and with a deep breath, pushed the door open.Shopkeepers must have an obsession with stacking shelves tight. Ollivander was no different. Shelf upon shelf, touching the ceiling, were stacks of boxes. Long boxes, short boxes. Big and small boxes. Boxes with colors and then ones with no color at all.Diagon Alley was something else, entirely.The door closed with a sharp thud, making Harry jump. He would have liked to recognize the odors he was smelling, but he just didn't have the words. Well, there was wood. A lot of wood. A burning smile that wafted in like fog and other smells that accompanied it like a gentle friend, hand in hand."Why, hello there," a soft voice said. Harry jumped. Turning to the counter, Harry met with an old man. An old man whose wide, pale eyes were shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. Harry swallowed, moving closer to who he presumed to be the owner."Good afternoon," Harry said, almost in a question."Good afternoon, young man. And who might you be?"Harry flattened his fringe before speaking, "Harry Evans.""Harry Evans?"Harry nodded his head, wondering if he ought to go by James Evans in the near future, to disregard any relation with Harry Potter at all.The man scratched his chin, lost in thought, before his eyes lifted up, silver and bright. Hands clasped behind his back, he moved around the counter, a smile pulling at the lines around his mouth, "I once knew a woman named by Evans, I don't doubt you know it either. You look a mighty bright young man, Harry."Harry's surprise was overtaken by red cheeks. He tried to dismiss it with a cough, but his embarrassment stayed long after the man approached him, standing right in front of him with a hand stretched out, "I am the current and only Ollivander."Harry took the hand. Big, warm."What do you sell here, Mr Ollivander?""Magic, young Harry," Mr Ollivander said, without missing a beat.Harry blinked. And blinked again. He blinked as many times needed to process Mr Ollivander's words and derive some sense from them. He didn't. Many couldn't decipher Mr Ollivanders, surely, if he always spoke of such absurd things.But Harry was curious."Magic?""The best of its kind.""Can I see it?"Mr Ollivander smiled crookedly, the lines on his face easing, and beckoned him to the counter. Mr Ollivander told him to stand behind the corner, and that he would be back soon. Harry listened, shifting from one foot to the next, looking around the shop in hopes of finding what this magic Mr Ollivander was speaking of was. Harry scoffed, a grin on his face. Magic. As if such a thing existed. As if-Something landed on the counter. Harry lifted his eyes to see that instead of perhaps a wand or crystal ball, like the one in the healer's shop, Harry saw a long, white material pulled over a wooden frame. Beside the frame, was one of the long boxes from the shelves, black and white , and beside that was an old jar smeared with paint holding many, many brushes."Ah," said Harry with hesitant understanding, "Magic?""The very best," Mr Ollivander said, opening the box and picking out two tin jars, one labeled black and the other in white. Then, Harry understood."Paint.""Art," Mr Ollivander said in an air of correction, picking up a brush and dipping it into the black, "Is fine magic."He dragged the brush over the white material in a broad, clean stroke. It trailed behind a black smudge. Black, thick. Not very magical."I don't think I like this magic," Harry said, and Mr Ollivander chuckled, holding out the brush towards Harry, "Why don't you try it, Mr Evans?"Harry did. He took the brush in his hands, weighing it between his fingers. It wasn't anything elaborate. Just some wads of hair pressed into the end of a wooden stick. However hesitant, though, he brought the brush down onto the frame and with a sharp intake of breath, slashing it across the page in a sharp movement.The paint smeared black like sludge, muddy like soil near the rivers Harry and his chimney family used to bathe when they were allowed to (which was about two days a year). A wrenching pain struck his heart with the thought, surfacing some memories. He missed them. Harry missed his family so, so much. Their late night talks, their laughs, the dreams that one day would come true because now, Harry was going to get this world together and find his family a reason to live, not survive.He didn't wipe his eyes when they burned. Didn't hold back as his eyes watered and three lonely tears slid down his cheeks and dropped to the frame."Sorry," Harry mumbled, wishing to be numb again, "Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.""Most do not," Mr ollivander said, plucking the brush from his fingers, "But all the same-" he dipped it into the black paint, "It's a worthwhile canvas."Harry wiped his eyes with a bandaged arm. The canvas stared at him with an obsidian gaze, and Harry held back his tears when he was reminded of Snape.Mr Ollivander capped the paint and closed the box lid. Gripping the cardboard in his hand, he bent down to slide it under the counter along with the jar of paintbrushes, "Will you be buying anything, young Harry.""No, sir," Harry said, patting his pockets, "I'm saving for my family.""Ah, a noble act," Mr Ollivander said with a smile of approval, his silver eyes shining brighter, "But do come for a visit. I daresay you should taste my tea."Harry nodded. Offering a wave, he made his way towards the door. Once outside, a gentle wind blew through him, washing him over with relief and leaving him with a smile. Though, it didn't last. The burning pain from missing his family had begun to dissipate, but a frown still pulled down on his lips. It dampened his mood. It fought his resolve and made him feel like a leaf in a storm, shaking in the wind, barely hanging on.Shaking his head to get rid of the thought only brought a headache. He didn't want to think about it. He wanted to forget. To forget their existence so maybe, possibly, he'd be well long enough to carry himself through the time he needed to earn enough control and money.With that, he turned on the curb. The dreaded street yawned in front of him, stretching longer than it actually was. Harry groaned. He wished he didn't have to walk back and face Tom and answer questions. The healer was decent enough to not ask questions. Tom would only call the whole inn's attention to Harry the minute he stepped inside. He didn't want to go back. He wanted to-"Harry?"Harry wanted to get out of there the minute he heard that voice.With wide eyes and parted lips, he turned around, lifting his eyes slowly from the small black shoes and up the small black dress towards the small face that looked far more horrified to see him there than Harry was horrified to see her."Is that you, Harry?"He winced at his name, clasping his hands behind his back and tried to appear as small as it was possible to be. And without looking into the wide eyes that he'd only want to see as kind, he muttered, voice breaking."Hello, Professor Patel."

We've all been waiting for this, haven't we? :)Thank you to Absinthe, my beta, for her continuous efforts.Hope you all enjoy. ;)Back at the Leaky Cauldron, Harry sat with his head planted on the table. His other arm prickled under the wood, and he didn't bother thinking of his injured arm as his fingers scratched down the unbandaged skin. Clumsy, impulsive. That was something Harry shared with the scratches. No doubt Professor Patel felt the same way about him, back turned to Harry and engaged in a lengthy conversation with Tom. Yasane was there, too, in the corner and throwing Harry the occasional, concerned glance. Harry pretended to not see them. His head continued to thud against the wood.Thud, thud, thud.The noise accompanied the throbbing of his heart. The hammering threatened to burst through his chest.Harry heard Professor Patel thank Tom quietly. Lifting his head, hair falling over his eyes, he could make out Professor Patel dropping something into her bag. With a fluid motion, she turned around. Her feet padded against the wood, almost nervous. Behind her, the book Harry had borrowed from the library lay dormant, abandoned - a reminder to Harry of a failure. A failure Professor Patel only damaged with her presence.She didn't smile, but gestured for him to follow. Her kind eyes didn't follow Harry as he pushed himself from the table, swinging his legs over the bench in a daze. With a sloppy wave at Tom and Yasane, he followed after the Professor.The world Harry came to know swirled out of focus and into the gloomy, grey streets of London. The smells, the sounds - It all altered pathetically into monotone, miserable passers-by of an equally monotonous, miserable world where the only smell was of grime and dirt. Professor Patel, impassive to the change, turned right. Her footsteps mingled with the many others parading down the street. Harry followed, mood spiraling down with every step.Professor Patel craned her neck to glance at Harry. Slowing down, she hung back until they were walking side by side, Harry's feet embarrassingly clumsy next to the marched trot of the Professor."How is your arm?" she asked, eyeing the bandages. On instinct, Harry slid his other hand over the bandage, starting at the top. His small fingers met the rough, bloodied shirt sleeves with uncomfortable solace. Healed was just one thing he was, among many. Bruised, healed, relieved, afraid. A whirlwind of emotion that had no place in his heart."I'm alright. I mean, well, it's not as bad.""Oh, dear. I was rather afraid, no... terrified to find you as such in the middle of the street, bloody shirt and lonely, rather ruffled. I'm glad you told Tom about the cut. I hope you'll be more careful of pens in the future," she paused, offering a thin smile which only built the guilt Harry had for lying to the Professor"Especially after hearing such troubling news from Professor Snape."Harry grimaced, tugging his bottom lip in a hard bite. Troubling news. Direct and derived from a terrible he couldn't be entirely sure, Harry had little doubt that this source was his relatives who had left the shop in havoc- jars pulled down from shelves, rations of herbs, plants, teas balms and more shattered on the ground in a heap of hopeless disappointment. Broken windows, crushed down doors and wallpaper that wouldn't ever heal, according to Professor Patel, who said it with such sorrow Harry had to wonder if the shop was hers. She couldn't be blamed though. Not for her sadness, not for her frown, not even for her down-turned eyes veiled behind her head scarf when the wind embraced the fabric particularly hard.They turned a corner on Professor Patel's command. A placid hand wrapped around his shoulder, steering him clear from the path of a dense crowd. Her eyes remained bitter and dismal. Dormant. It didn't suit Harry to want them to be kind, suffused in warmth. It was selfish, demanding, and something he didn't deserve to have.Not yet.Perhaps not ever.Harry took a deep breath, his heart anything but still, "Professor-"Professor Patel gave him a firm squeeze, "Not yet, Harry," she said, turning another corner that led to a flight of stairs, "Not yet. We're almost there."Harry swallowed thickly, feeling rather shut out. Shunned. And though he knew he deserved it, it stung cruelly inside his gut, a heavy stone seemingly dropping down from his heart.The stairs, plain and grey as they are, led them to a street much like the stairs themselves. Long, narrow. Leaving you panting and searching in a hazy spin for a sign of where you were and where you were meant to go. Professor Patel didn't falter in her composure. Her back stood firm, straight. Harry could barely see her chest rising beneath the layers of black fabric.No possible hindrance."Oh, dear. Would you like a minute?" she turned around and matched his pace, her veil drooping beneath her chin when she bent down to his height, brows tightly knit together. Harry ignored her concerned gaze, hands on his knees while he waited for the pounding in his chest and ears to stop.After a few minutes, "I'm fine," he said, lifting his head shakily, "Are we almost there?""Actually, we are," Professor Patel said, back straightening, head turning to face a house close behind them. Breath still ragged, Harry followed her gaze across the street and along the height of a red house to a simple two story building. It was warm-colored and comfortable, but not inviting. Not for Harry. He followed the Professor anyway.There were people outside. A small amount, so few as to be called a handful. Harry shrunk down against their stares, moving beside the Professor with a nervous step of feet. Professor Patel, in return, recoiled from Harry. Whirling around in a motion that sent her skirts flowing in a flowery swirl before pooling on the floor. Harry, defeated and betrayed, wistfully drew back. He didn't lift his head when Professor Patel called a stranger's name and fumbled inside her bag.For a few moments, there was the familiar scratching of pen on paper followed by a set of footsteps and a foreign tongue. Unfamiliar to Harry, but undoubtedly familiar to the boy exchanging it with Professor Patel.The conversation ceased. The boy shouted cheerfully after them, feet breaking into a run."I have sent Professor Snape a message. He should be here soon, considering he has no house visits to make."The spin Harry made to look at Professor Patel hurt his neck. Groaning, he slammed a hand down on his skin, Snape momentarily out of his mind until the thought came crashing back down."Professor Patel, you don't have to.""It's quite alright," Professor blissfully assured in her ignorance, dismissing his concerns with a smile, "He's rather worried, I'm certain."Harry swallowed thickly, dropping his eyes, "He..." Harry tried in a whisper, "Professor Snape isn't angry?"Harry wasn't sure what he was expecting Professor Patel to say. He hoped Snape wasn't angry. He hoped that right as he got the message, Snape either came running to make sure Harry was safe or not at all. Though, Snape was always concerned for something. Concerned about the shop, about his customers and herbs. Sometimes that concern was anger more than anything else.Concern and only concern was all Harry wanted at this time.But Professor Patel didn't answer. Not verbally. Instead of reassurance, her lips pulled into a sharp smile and a maniac laugh escaped her - crazy, high pitched and echoing despite the absence of space in which to echo. The laugh startled Harry almost to the point of falling, his eyes wide with mild fear. She had tried, and failed, to hide it behind a clothed hand.The brutal picture of Sirius Black entered his mind.It was gone as suddenly it came, however - the laugh that couldn't possibly be hers and the picture that wasn't meant to be in his mind in the first place. They left, and Harry was left with the soft smiling, ever sweet, kind-eyed Professor Patel."He... He is angry, isn't he, Professor?""What?" Professor Patel asked, brows disappearing up under her veil. They dropped in understanding not a second later, and Harry was afraid she'd fall into another fit of crazy laughter. Her face had contored into a vaguely mysterious expression, after all. But Harry would rather not bother solving it."Oh, dear. Not at all, Harry," Professor Patel said, walking towards the two story house, leaving a much too relieved Harry behind her.Then she snatched it all brutally away."He's rather furious."The door opened with a twist of a key. Too easily, too quickly. Harry wasn't prepared. Professor Patel's hand steered him from the now closed and locked door and stopped him beside a shelf that held-Shoes?Pairs of shoes. Five pairs of shoes. Women's shoes and men's shoes. Two shelves of them with two more empty ones lined underneath. Harry's eyes narrowed further when Professor Patel bent down to take off the one's she was wearing, collecting them in her hands and stepping onto a red-brown carpet while sliding them into the slot at the very top."Would you please take off your shoes as well?" Professor Patel said, turning to face Harry.Harry regarded her with a tilted head before turning around and sitting down on the carpet, slipping his shoes out and taking one on each hand. Scanning the empty shelves, he pushed his own shoes directly under a black pair collecting dust. Oddly, that was the only pair that looked to be doing so. The rest were well-kept and in good quality."Follow me, Harry," Professor Patel pulled him from his thoughts and into a hallway leading to an area which opened to three closed doors.Harry didn't dare linger far behind while looking around, but the slow pace Professor Patel walked with gave Harry the chance to take a look around the moderate-sized house. The condition wasn't half bad, well enough to match the apothecary's... previous quality. The interior, while simple, was coloured in rich pigments and held no space for decoration of any kind save for a mirror in the hallway they left behind."Ahmed?" Aisha called into the house, rapping on one of the closed doors, "Where are you, habibi?"A male voice came from the door to the very right, calling out in a foreign word, one similar to what Professor Patel had spoken with the boy outside, before the door opened, revealing a young man that resembled Professor Patel in one of those chairs with wheels Harry had seen in Diagon Alley.The man, who had dark skin, black hair and (unlike Professor Patel) black eyes greeted them with a soft smile before his eyes fell on Harry and his lips pulled down into a confused frown."Aisha?"Professor Patel approached the young man, Ahmed, and bent down to plant a soft kiss to his hair line with another jumble of words. Ahmed replied with a similar set and gestured Harry with an incline of his head, and the two conversed in their language. Harry recognized his and Snape's name with a decent amount of worry and panic, which Professor Patel tried to ease with a smile once she turned around."Harry, this is my brother Ahmed. Ahmed, this is Harry."Professor Patel's brother rolled forward in his chair and extended a hand, "Nice to meet you," he said in an accent unfamiliar to Harry, gripping his hand in a gentle hold."Nice to meet you too Mr. Patel," Harry managed, shaking back, dropping his hand to his side and fumbling with the hem of his shirt nervously when Mr. Patel pulled back with a laugh."It's been a while since I've been called that," he managed between a hearty chuckle, shaking his head and meeting his sister's eye."Too long," Professor Patel confirmed, a chuckle of her own escaping her lips. Facing Harry, she slipped a hand behind his back, not pushing him but urging him forward to the door in the middle, "Please wait here while I wash up and bring us some tea. Ahmed-" she twisted her head to face the man once Harry had sat down on one of the sofas in what must be a parlor, "-would you stay with Harry while I wash up?"Mr Patel nodded, turning his chair around so he could enter through the doors. Meeting Harry's eyes with a smile, he pulled into an empty spot beside an armchair, flexing his hands before letting them rest on the armrests."So, you were an assistant to Professor Snape?" Mr Patel chose to start, clasping his hands on his lap, "I haven't seen him in a long time. How is he?"Harry swallowed. He averted his eyes from side to side at first, unsure how to continue. Opening and closing his mouth multiple times, he finally spoke, head lowered and back hunched, "Well, I think. He was... irritated. Rather angry, I think.""What? With you?"Harry rubbed his arm, "I hope not, sir."Mr Patel chuckled, easing back into his chair with relief, "I don't enjoy seeing him irritated with me, either.""Sir-" Harry spoke before he could stop himself, throat drying when Mr Patel turned to face him."Yes?"Harry cleared his throat. Twice and once more for good measure, though it didn't do any good. His voice fell as soon as he started to speak, "I- nevermind.""No, no. Do go on."Harry lifted his eyes. Mr Patel gave him a firm nod, waving his hand for him to continue. Harry nodded in return, and took a deep breath."So you- You and Professor Patel... Do you know Professor Snape well? Professor Snape said, um, I remember him saying he and Professor Patel work at the same... school," it came out with an air of question rather than statement, and Harry winced at his own tone while he continued, "Can you tell me about it?""Me? Well, I'm not as close to him as my sister, understandably, but yes. They work at the same school, Professor Snape as a teacher of chemistry and Aisha, well, I don't know exactly, but I know she works with a portion of students. We've gotten close because the apothecary he runs actually belongs to our family."Harry blinked, narrowing his eyes, "Your family?"Mr Patel nodded, "The apothecary belonged to our mother, but in recent years, we've had trouble managing it after her death. My father is a tradesman, and is often overseas. I'm a lawyer, but-" he motioned his legs, tapping his thigh with a tight-lipped smile, "-I cannot find work, for a number of reasons. We couldn't sell the shop yet, as it was on contract, and we couldn't find anyone to keep the shop. That is, until Aisha discussed the matter with Professor Snape and he agreed to board there during summers until the end of this year. It was a fair deal, profitable, for both parties.""Who was the shopkeeper when Professor Snape wasn't there?"Mr Patel smiled sharply and pointed at himself with his thumb, "Why, me, of course! I have no knowledge of medicine, but I can manage sales of some plants and flowers.""Oh, dear," a voice said by the door, and Professor Patel walked in, carrying a tray with a jug and bowl, "If I remember, you almost caused the demise of the shop until you agreed to take in an assistant.""Well, I'm not exactly tall, am I?"Professor Patel placed the tray beside Harry on the sofa. Now Harry could see that beside the jug and bowl, was a dry, rough looking towel and a block of-"Soap," said Professor Patel, thrusting the soap into his hands, "I thought it'd be best for you to wash up here."Harry took the slippery bar into his hands and held them over the bowl, scrubbing his hands as he was told, surprised and rather ashamed to see the colour of the water when Professor Patel began to pour the water from the jug over his hands. Once Professor Patel was sure his hands were of acceptable standard, she handed him the towel and began to walk out the room.Harry stopped her mid-way."Professor Patel?"She turned around, raising a brow."I'm so sorry... about your shop, that is. If I had known..."Professor Patel's expression softened, and she turned around fully to stand in front of Harry."You could not have known, though. Those two wretched people had no right to damage our shop-""They paid the price, though, Aisha-""It wasn't enough! I want to see them in jail-""We had the charges thoroughly paid, including the insurance-""Not what I'm trying to say, habibi," Professor Patel said through her teeth, and the two of them shared a glare. A moment later, both of their drawn brows relaxed and Harry swallowed thickly, looking between the two with growing anxiety."The truth is," Mr Patel spoke, stepping carefully into the matter, "You are not at fault. The two responsible for the damage are, and we've already settled it with court, have we not? We're lucky Professor Snape reached the shop just in time-"That's when there came a hard, loud knock from the hallway. A heavy rap that snatched Harry by the heart and shook him until his soul came to pass on.Thud, thud, thud.It echoed inside his head, chest, ears, and throat. Suffocatingly loud. Terrifying.Professor Patel left the room with a swirl of her skirt, her feet disappearing down the hallway. A door opening, closing. More footsteps and the shuffling of shoes and finally, the outside door opening.Harry couldn't hear much, both from his anxiety and the length of the hall. However, he did hear Professor Patel shout just once, demanding someone take off his shoes, which ended the conversation entirely until there was the sound of another set of shoes being pushed into the shelf.Harry's ragged breathing hitched, almost stopping. Thud, thud, thud came the footsteps from the hallway. The wreckage that was Harry's heart threatened to rise up his throat and out like bile. His head spun, making wild circles and unbalanced twirls. Taking it between his hands didn't help, but until the very second the Patels called his name, one concerned, one asking for his attention, it was solace.Harry lifted his head.Professor Snape stood with his hands behind his long coat."Mr Potter," Snape said, stepping through, his eyes narrowing towards Harry's arm, "I believe we have much to discuss."Professor Snape marched the length of the room with uncharacteristic speed. Measured steps crossed the distance between the door and the window before repeating, while more unfavorable words tumbled out of his mouth. Words which were all stolen from Harry's mind, yet multiplied ten-fold in difficulty leaving Harry confused with cheeks shamefully aflame."Idiot, idiot child!" he is free to say, because the Patels are out of the room and have promised to not intervene, "I ask for you to do one thing -one thing, Potter! One simple task!- and you again manage to bewilder me by doing the exact opposite. Opening the door, Potter! I fail to see how you can manage to get into such circumstances when my exact instructions would have prevented you from all and any danger!"The floor sways under Harry's feet. His eyes burn with unshed tears and his knuckles white from his harsh grip on the seat beneath him . Snape doesn't pause, and in the following minutes, Harry is left to listen to Snape's tirade, the scolding that is 'less than he deserves'.Ten long, angry minutes later and Snape throws himself down onto a chair. Ten long, terrible minutes and a few seconds later, his head in his hands and his chest rises with exhausted relief.Not a minute later, and Snape lifts his head. His narrow, black eyes boring into Harry's own and the boy looks away, wiping a stray tear with the back of his head. Snape sighs. Harry wants to look up, look up, and see with deadly curiosity if Snape held concern in his eyes, or if they still flashed with anger.He doesn't dare.Snape summons his attention anyway. He does so with a voice both exhausted and something else Harry doesn't understand."How do you plan on defending yourself, Mr Potter?"Harry didn't. He hadn't thought he needed to, what with running away and assuming a job in Diagon Alley. He had planned on never meeting the Professor again. He was wrong. Very, very wrong, he thought, as the Professor matched him a scowl and a glare; his black hair fell in a curtain around his head far greasier than usual. His clothes too, now that Harry paid better attention, were stained and sewn clumsily in one spot; patches of white coloured certain areas.Snape cleared his throat, claiming Harry's attention once more with a thin lipped frown."I asked you a question, Mr Potter. After your late night travels and a span of a week without your notified absence, do me the courtesy of answering my questions. Honestly and verbally."Harry wiped his eyes once more, the burning not easing, "I-I don't, sir. I never did.""Never, you say?"Harry shook his head in emphasis, "I didn't think-"Snape scoffed in a manner which said 'obviously'."I didn't think I'd..." he said, pausing to swallow and continued the rest in a whisper, "I didn't plan on seeing you again.""What was that, Potter?" Snape bit back, raising a brow.Harry repeated. Once more in a whisper."Louder, Potter! Didn't you hear me when I said-""I said I didn't plan on seeing you again, Snape!"The lethal silence stretched far more than necessary between them.Harry heard his own hitch of breath. He heard the pause while Snape's back straightened. He heard, with dangerous fear, the ominous foreboding threat in wavering, fast approaching lines.He heard great many things, but only saw the way Snape's eyes first rose in mild surprise before narrowing into thin slits in what could only be anger.The world spiraled out of focus the minute Snape pushed from his seat with unnatural speed."Do. Not. Call. Me. That," Snape gritted when their noses were touching, both hands on either side of Harry's seat, his back arching over the armchair, "I mean it, Potter," he advanced in a stern whisper and a raised finger, making Harry back away as much as he could in the chair, his eyes wide, "I will not put up with it, I assure you."Another silence. Harry hoped that, in a few short minutes, Snape would back away and leave Harry alone to deal with his thumping, racing heart. He didn't, and Harry's heart beat faster against his chest, threatening to steal his soul away, when Snape spoke once more."Now, tell me once again: How do you plan on explaining your actions?"Harry refused to look back at those eyes, and hid behind a wall of his own arms wrapped about his knees pulled against his chest, "I'm sorry, Professor Snape. I truly am. I know you told me to lock the door. I know you told me to-to..." he broke off midway, voice cracking unceremoniously, "I know you did. You're right. I know. But when I-I saw them... They were there and-" he wiped another tear he couldn't hold back, sniffing a few times, "They were there, Professor Snape, and I couldn't close the door, you know? They were banging on the window and Uncle Vernon looked so angry, and I couldn't do it!" he cried out the last part, ignoring Snape as he flinched back, "I thought... I thought maybe... You'd taken me in, Professor. And you told Mast- Edwin that you'd report him, and I believed-" and Harry had believed. It was all he had done, and for that, he cried, streams of tears flowing down his cheeks, "I thought I could have been strong, alright? Brave. I thought I could have fended them off because I was away from them. I was here."I was with you.Clearly, I was wrong.Professor Snape didn't step back. But his expression settled into something Harry hadn't seen before. Professor Snape didn't step back, no, but grimaced at the loud sniff Harry had produced. Slender fingers dug into his breast pocket before returning with a handkerchief which he dropped into Harry's hands and refused to take it back with a grimace when Harry was finished using it.Harry dropped it on the coffee table, much to Snape's distaste and resigned himself to occasional sobs and sniffs.Snape sighed, dropping his arms to his side and pinching the bridge of his nose, "Potter-""I found... I learned some things, while I was away ," Harry cut him off, willing himself to speak now that Snape was far less angry, "Things about-" he looked up, eyes red and puffy, into Snape's creased ones, "-my past. And my family."Snape's face fell along with his hands. His skin, which was already profoundly pale, turned sallow and pulled at his cheekbones. It made him look thin. Sickly. And for a second, Harry was reminded that Snape didn't look well at all.He ignored it for his own peace of mind."The Boy-Who-Lived. That's what they called me. Did you know some aristocrat was going around murdering babies thirteen years ago, and the reason I earned the title was because he couldn't murder me?" Harry said, biting out the last bits with rising anger. His jaw clenching with his fists while he continued, eyes narrowed almost as tight as Snape could pull them, "When were you going to tell me, sir? When were you going to tell me about my-" he licked his lips, heart viciously banging against his ribs, "my parents? My name?""Potter-""I didn't even know their names!"It came out in a scream that upset the coffee table as he stood up and shattered the ounce of self-control he prided himself to have. He didn't care. Not about Snape. Not about some debt.Snape watched with raised, amused brows. Watched as first Harry stood up. Watched as Harry straightened his back. And finally, Snape watched as Harry pursed his lips and puffed his chest in foolish bravado."I didn't know their names. I didn't know anything about them.""Your knowledge, or the lack thereof, does not involve me," said Snape, sweeping the dust above the floor with his coat as he made a turn for the door, "We've lingered far more than necessary here. We'll take this conversation back home, once you've cooled your temper."When Harry stood his ground, Snape turned to face him with a ready scowl, hand on the door knob."Mr Potter, it's not in your favor to spoil my patience. I have clearly said we will take this conversation to the shop, where we have the luxury of not intruding on other people's hospitality. Now come, Mr Potter."Harry breathed in, closing his eyes. When they opened, they opened fierce. Bright. He shook his head, subtly, twice, and clenched his jaw."I'm not going with you."There was a silence of five seconds, where Snape too closed his eyes and resumed with a stern voice upon opening them, as though he was trying particularly hard to not throttle the nearest object at reach."Potter, do not test my patience. I don't have the energy nor mentality to deal with your tantrums. Either you will come with me!" he screamed, cutting Harry off with a raised finger and livid eyes, "Or I will leave you to find your own way back to the dirty slums as you so wish."Harry threw up his arms, landing a kick to the side of the sofa, "I said I won't come! I'm not going anywhere with you!""You do not have a choice in the matter!" Snape shouted in return, prowling closer. And for each step he took towards Harry, Harry took a step back until the back of his legs touched the sofa and his flailing arm landed on the coffee table for support. He'd be cornered again, with another measured step, his nose touching the Professor's.Not this time.With speed that surprised Harry himself, he slipped past at the very last second. Sliding around the Professor's slender frame to bolt for the door.With speed that surprised Snape himself, he caught Harry by the collar at the very last second. Choking him with a disgruntled sound, he was pulled down onto the floor with his head facing the ceiling.Harry's neck burned, and so did his eyes. More so when Snape's face appeared in his swirling vision, which he regarded with a scowl while his tears prickled."I hate you," Harry whispered raggedly, pulling his arm over his head, body shaking with brief, sporadic tremors, "I hate you for so many reasons. You have no idea, do you?" he paused, heart skipping a beat, " Do you even care?""I have my intuitions. And no," he paused, bending down, "I do not," Snape replied from somewhere in the dark; his cold, long fingers meeting Harry's small ones and pulling him to a stand."Let's go, Potter. You've had enough adventures."And as he was led to the door, coiling back from the light, he could almost agree.However, before they could leave through the hallway, Professor Patel exited from the door on the side, which from above her shoulder, Harry could make out a kitchen."You're leaving already, Professor Snape?" she asked, looking rather dreary. Harry hoped it wasn't in regards to what Snape would do to him.Snape's grip on his upper arm pulled him back to a stop, his shoulders dropping their tension, "We've overstayed your hospitality as is. I apologise, Professor Patel, for getting you involved in our affairs."Professor Patel didn't look back at Snape. Instead, she stood standing in front of them for some while, looking lost in thought before a sharp smile pulled on her lips and she shook her head. Harry was afraid she'd fall into another fit of scary laughter."I say it's somehow my affair as well, Professor Snape," she said, crossing her arms, "I'll see you out."And with her in the lead, Harry was marched forcefully by the steel grip Snape had on his arm, the hold momentarily gone whilst he put on his shoes only to return back on his shoulder as they walked out the door."Oh, and Professor Snape?"Snape and Harry turned to look back, just as they reached the bottom of the stairs."I hope you'll be inclined to share whatever… proceeding you have going on with young Harry with us soon.""Have I made it far too obvious?" Snape asked, voice mingled in both amusement and irritation.She shrugged, a hand closing the door to a crack, "Obvious enough for me. Take care?"And the door closed with a click.Thank you for sparing your time to reading this. If it's no trouble, please don't hesitate to comment anything below, for they drive the story forward. :)The next chapters will be a delight, specifically chap. 8, filled with even more wholesome, angsty, fun and whump-y moments. Hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am. Hope to see you next week, everyone.Salam!

In this chapter, you'll find that I put some details into hygine, and Harry declares his opinion on the matter in one line. This is because, well I don't know if you guys looked at 19th century hygine, England was dirty. I mean, really dirty. Fish and drink water from the same place the drainage pours to dirty. Survive surgery but die because the surgeon didn't wash his hands dirty. So what Snape, Aisha (and Uluthando, in the previous chapters) did is revolutinary. And necessary if they don't want to die.This also explains the line of the water closet and water filter. It reads a bit awkward, but necessary for the reader to understand the 1874 period. Aisha is also Muslim, a religion that highlightes hygine/cleanliness as the half of belief, so I had to put that in.Also, the Ottoman Emire, which was stıill standing at the time, was really one of the cleanest state of the world. So please excuse me when I take some examples of what they did and incorparate it into the story as to make sure the characters survive to face Voldemort.Sorry for the long note. Enjoy the story!A considerably short walk paved the road back to the familiar street of the apothecary.This time, on his fourth visit to the brick street, Harry spared little attention to his surroundings and all attention to the sign that was balanced above the door of the approaching apothecary. Patel Apothecary.He regarded it with an audible gulp and accumulating dread.The turn of the key in the lock didn't help.Nor did the barren sight of the apothecary.The wallpaper was exactly as Professor Patel had said, hanging by the walls pathetically like sagging fabric. On one particular wall, a shelf, of conspicuously Dursley height, was empty. Not a single jar, glass, or phial lined the barren wood.The door closed behind him with a sharp thud and he couldn't find it in himself to be uncomfortable with the familiar smell of the apothecary when the sound rattled both the window and Harry. The door clicked once more, ominously and almost silently. Wind swiped Harry's side when Snape walked past him with a billow of his coat. The coat was off and hanging from the hanger with one sleek move and then Harry found himself in front of a glaring Snape. His arms were crossed. His lips thin lines beneath his scowl. That is how Harry found himself wishing for his bed in Diagon Alley after all."So," Snape began, sounding more and more like Uncle Vernon, "Have you cooled your temper to a manageable level?"Harry toed the floor and allowed himself a nod.Snape gave a long, exhausted sigh. His shoulders sagged with the motion, and Snape looked suddenly too old. The lines on his forehead and under his eyes eased to small creases. He appeared gaunt, miserable - a walking set of emotions in dire need of rest."At the moment, Potter, I have no endurance to spare for our... inevitable talk. Head to your room and sleep. You'll be rising with me tomorrow. And believe me, Potter-" a clawed hand landed on Harry's shoulder, stopping him from reaching the door that opened to the staircase, "You'll be needing every minute of it."There was no Snape to calm him from a nightmare, that night. And he only barely managed to stop himself from letting his other arm bleed.True to his word, Snape did wake him up early, during the murky, grey hours of the morning. Those too early as to be morning, too draining as to be any good.He pulled on his socks and then his boots with unwilling hands. Clumsy fingers prying the fabric under his pants and stuffing the shirt borrowed from Snape inside his trousers. But then, he paused. The morning ticked away around him and Harry didn't stop it. He dismissed it and instead stared at bandages wrapped under the shirt with rolled sleeves.The morning ticked into colour. Harry opened the door, the bed and his attire equally tended to. The chair he pulled out screeched on the floor and yet Snape, who was working on the counter, didn't so much as flinch. Ah. Silence, then. Snape had chosen silence. Cruel silence of unspoken rules and boundaries. Invisible borders scattered with trial and error.Harry hated silence.The morning blossomed into yellow and orange when Snape brought two plates of steaming eggs, bread, and potatoes to the table. They thudded onto the table, a pair of forks clattering beside them just as Snape collapsed on the opposite seat."Eat," came the simple order.Harry waited until Snape took the first bite, loosening his hold on the sides of the chair. For a few more seconds, he watched Snape take a couple of bites from his plate, twirling the fork in his hands while he read an older copy of the Daily Prophet, chewing very, very slowly.Harry lifted his own hand. His fingers, shaking and weak compared to Snape's, inched closer to the utensil and twirled the tips through the food."Food won't always be at your disposal, Mr Potter," Snape said, lifting his eyes high enough to stare at him behind his curtain of hair, "Eat. You're among the last of those I need remind of what it means to lack food."Harry flushed. Stabbing his fork down rather viciously on the potato, he swallowed his share of the meal with a few mouthfuls, forcing Snape to remind him to slow down before he caused him unwanted paperwork. Once his misdirected anger was through, however, Harry was left alone and bored under the smug grin of Snape as he savaged his food with cruel pleasure.At last, Snape too pushed away his own plate. The newspaper, folded carelessly into a crinkled heap, was dropped on the edge of the table, as he collected his and Harry's dishes in a stacked pile and leaned back on his chair.Another sigh. Another reminder for Harry of what was coming."Now, start from the beginning. The very beginning. Honestly, verbally, clearly and not a single detail left unsaid."And with much reluctance, Harry did. Starting his talk with trailing words and occasional whispers before shifting into long, animated explanations. He told Snape of what happened after he was gone. How Harry locked the door, how he was planning on doing as the Professor had told him. How his relatives and their mighty fists disturbed his work and how, without being aware of where he was going, he found himself on the bridge, alone save for his mind and a lone figure on the other side that he could have only imagined. He spoke of the Knight Bus, of Diagon Alley, of its people and finally, of what he learned about Harry Potter."I'm the Boy-Who-Lived. That's what they called me. Or, well, what they called Harry Potter. I was Harry Evans when I got there.""You told me you didn't know what your parents were called."Harry winced, squared his shoulders and looked at the door that led down to the apothecary, "Aunt Marge... her mouth slipped. Called my mother Evans, and that... she had..." he looked right into the black depths of Snape's eyes, "Bad blood."Snape said nothing, and Harry continued."Did you know she had dark skin? Darker than mine. And green eyes as well as red hair, much, much redder than mine," he ran a hand gently through his own, trying to flatten his bangs, "Alexandria Alexander said-""Who?" snapped Snape, brows knitted furiously close and eyes narrowed in vague confusion."Alexandria Alexander, author of Recent Local History, volume two-" Snape ran a hand down his face before masking his eyes behind two hands, "-said her muse told her she was Indian. Is that true? Doesn't explain why Aunt Petunia-" Harry swallowed thickly, wrenching his eyes closed and keeping them that way until the nausea rising up his throat came to pass, "Nevermind… I don't think…"Snape didn't seem to mind his trailing words. In fact, he looked rather relieved. The hands that were covering his face fell to his sides. They were skeletal things that dropped limply. At the sight of them, Harry felt an abrupt flash of… something, somewhere in his mind. Not a memory. Not a thought. Not entirely an emotion but a reminder. Long, soft and cool hands. Ruffling his hair, touching his forehead. It hadn't happened, surely?But did it ever feel right.And it was gone long before Harry could desciper it."It was," Snape said dryly, pulling Harry from his thoughts.Harry lifted his head, brows raised, "What?""Your mother, Li… Lily Potter. She was Indian, as the book portrays ," at Harry's dazzled look, Snape cleared his throat, "I don't trust…. Alexander's work. But this I know to be true."Harry found that his voice had betrayed him. His throat had gone paper dry and the words that he meant to speak stolen from his lips. So instead, he choked out a sob. It seized Snape's attention, as well as mild concern, but he did nothing to stop Harry from messaging his clogged throat while searching internally for the questions he meant to ask.When Harry made no move to speak, Snape started the conversation once more."Does that conclude your discoveries of your past?"Harry touched his forehead. Specifically the scar that wounded down his skin, "Yes. That, and that people only know gossip about me.""People barely know little else," Snape said, with a snort, eyeing Harry who was flattening down his bangs, "Has anyone recognized you?""Other than you?" Harry said with traces of anger, "No, Professor. You'll be relieved to know that you're the only sensible bloke about.""Watch it, Potter," came the reply, a low, dangerous hiss escorted with a glare. "You are under my roof once again. Whether that is to your liking or not, that hardly involves me. I deserve every ounce of res-""Why did you not tell me that you recognized me?"Snape took a deep breath and murmured something Harry couldn't hear, "Perhaps I haven't made myself clear enough. I-""Did you think I wouldn't find out? After you've taught me how to read, how to write…" Harry trailed off once more, lifting his eyes to look at the narrow gaze of the Professor, "Why did you do that, anyway? You didn't need to teach me anything, and it was clearly a hassle. So why?"Professor Snape made no answer. Nor did he do anything else. Fixing Harry with a signature glare, he started to impatiently fiddle his fingers over the armrest. Harry thought that the man was pouring out his anger with each tap, because at the end of the tenth one, Snape clasped his hands on his lap, face neutral."Seeing as you're eager to not listen to me, I shan't speak at all," he snapped, rattling the table with his stand, "I want you to be in front of the door of the laboratory in exactly two minutes with your shirt."Harry made a frantic stand of his own, "No, wait, sir-""I, of course, won't suffer the consequences of your actions. But believe me, Potter-" and he shot Harry a nasty smirk from behind the counter, "It will be a pleasure, seeing you suffer."Fuming, Harry made a sharp turn towards his (once again) room, "Suffer your displeasure, you mean," he hissed under his breath.Snape's chuckle rang mockingly in his ears.Snape met him exactly five minutes later.Harry had spent the remaining three minutes angrily replaying the awful things he'd like to do to the man in his mind. His jacket, sleeve still bloody, hung down his arm, wrinkled into a lump."I will not bother ironing your shirt, if it comes to that, Potter," Snape said, appearing out of nowhere and scaring Harry into a jump. Ignoring Harry's growl, he opened the door and stepped inside first."Do not attempt to look around. Your funeral will be a mighty short event, if you come to fall," Snape said in an echoing voice, his shoes clicking against metal. Taking a deep breath, Harry hung his head and kept his eyes fixed on the steps, only sparing a glance at the railings to grab hold of them.The staircase, metal and small, spiralled into a circle as it arched down. Snape was already down and waiting for him with a green work apron, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows and hands crossed in front of his chest. Waving a nonchalant hand, he gestured around the shop, "Welcome to my laboratory. Do not touch. A. Thing. Potter. I assure you digging your body fro…"Harry let the rest of Snape's words drag in the background as he looked around, eyes growing wide with every look.Harry didn't understand why but above them, where a ceiling was meant to be, there were arching panes of glass separated by thin borders. They provided the light needed to see the rest of the laboratory and even Harry had to absorb the impressive sight.On one side of the wall, there were only cabinets. Two of them held thick, bound books of various sizes and colours and beside those, were shelves and cupboards all filled with jars, phials and glass bottles - iridescent and of different lengths, labeled in sharp, black writing.That wasn't all, though. Harry took a step towards the cabinets and raised his head upwards, where on top of the cabinets were even more jars and all sorts of important looking objects hiding frames and papers behind them.Harry turned to another wall. The one opposite the wall behind him which held a currently working fireplace. Again, more jars. More shelves but among those, herbs hung from thin ropes on the walls. The same applied for the final wall, with cabinets and shelves and herbs, but this time only two of those held empty glass containers. It wasn't difficult to know why, seeing the table in the middle of the room - the gem of the crown.A simple, wooden table that held a chaotic order of, well, a chaotic order. A few pots dangled from the ceiling by chains. Papers, mortars, inks and pens were all scattered carelessly over the surface. There were scales, jars of pens and flowers, small boxes holding different coloured herbs, lamps, contraptions, empty glass phials joining other empty glass phias with glass tubes. The whole laboratory looked to be a turmoil of misplaced objects that should have been orderly but had no way to be so."...burn you. Understand, Potter?""Huh?" Harry whirled around to see Snape who was standing beside a grinder and hourglass, fiddling with the objects (pens, empty bottles, note papers) hoisted on the belt of the apron, "Uh, yes, Professor. I think I have."Snape looked up from the watch that was hanging from the belt, raising a brow, "You have listened to my every word.""I've heard them.""Yes, but you haven't cared for them have you?"Harry shrugged, averting his eyes towards the table with a shy smile, "It's a brilliant laboratory."Both of Snape's eyebrows lifted at that. Harry, who was too busy looking at the papers on the walls and a book held open on a stand, didn't notice Snape following him with curious, confused eyes.Didn't notice the flicker of a smile on Professor Snape's lips.Didn't notice it disappear just as quick.Harry turned to face Snape when he cleared his throat. He had changed his appearance once more and had a pair of big, odd looking round glasses hanging from his neck and a pencil behind his ear."For now, your task is to get rid of those horrid stains of yours. I have boiled water-" he pointed at the still simmering pot and a small bucket sitting on the stone, some steam rising from it, "And wash it in the garden. Away from the patches. Understood?""Yes, sir."And taking the pot by the handle, Harry walked towards the stairs."Potter!"Harry turned around with a sigh, tilting his head to the side."Use the soap outside the water closet. I won't have you walking around with saturated red sleeves," Snape said, pulling his hair back and tying it with a ribbon he had in his hand.Harry stared, blinking in confusion at the sight in front of him."Potter?""You're just like Professor Patel. She too told me to wash up the minute I entered the house."Snape shook his head and turned to face the table, rummaging through the papers, "It's the only sensible thing to do.""Not where I come from. I heard bathing makes you sick. This isn't any different, is it?"Snape stared at Harry with a neutral nonchalant gaze and was silent once more. Harry shrugged, making his way up the stairs.The garden, or yard, was relatively unremarkable. The right side was reserved for the two small garden-patches as well as some pots. Harry did his best to steer clear of the rows of potatoes and onions, balancing the heavy bucket while trying to walk on the grey paving stones. Looking to his left, he could make out where the panes above the laboratory started and berated himself for not taking better note of it earlier, considering the trips he had taken to the water closet.Grabbing the soap which was inside a small bowl beside an empty pile, Harry crouched down on the other side of the water closet and bent down, balancing the rest of the shirt on his shoulder while he poured some water down on the sleeve and began to scrub.While the blood slowly poured down to the dark soil, Harry began to think.So the apothecary belonged to the Patels. Harry's mind slowly drifted to the objects and contraptions down at the laboratory and apothecary, and wondered whether Snape or the Patel's themselves were rich. Buying so many jars and materials had to cost money. And even if you ignored that, the building itself had some… aspects that Harry was sure normal houses couldn't afford. One of them being the hand pump they had in the garden itself, which was a luxury in it's own. The other being what Snape had called a filter, which cleaned water (cleaned water!) which Snape would later boil to ensure it stayed that way. And finally, there was the water closet. Cleaner than anything Harry had ever used, even though in order to use, you had to crouch down, as there was no seat to sit on.Harry learned not to complain, though. For the first time in his life, he had felt clean here, and didn't feel any shame for it at all, despite the tales Edwin had told them about how washing themselves would only bring death upon their heads. No, Harry thought while hanging his wet shirt over the fence and grabbing the bucket, even if Snape ordered him to a bath, he wouldn't complain at all.Rolling down his sleeves, Harry climbed back into the shop and slipped past the open door into the laboratory, careful as to not slip on the metal stairs and heaved the bucket down beside the fireplace with exhausted relief.Snape didn't look behind him, so Harry chose to step forward instead, peeking out from behind the man to find him writing multiple sharp words on the papers in front of him before his masterful hands grabbed hold of a small bowl and began to mix the ingredients inside into a mushy substance.Flexing his fingers, which Harry only noticed now were filled with small cuts and waxy in some areas from past burns, Snape lifted the small bowl and barely dodged Harry as he turned around. He fixed Harry with a glare, once his composure and balance had returned."I see you have arrived. The shirt, I hope I'll find in sufficient condition.""I think you will, Professor," Harry said, clasping his hands behind his back, "What are you doing?"Balm, for a client," Snape said, mixing the substance as he walked towards one of the cabinets, pulling open one drawer to reveal various metal containers before walking to the other side and doing the same, only retrieving a small, glass container with a lid, "For future reference, I ask you to not sneak behind me whilst I work. Understood?""Yes, sir."Snape didn't acknowledge him, but returned to the table in the middle of the room and placed both the jar and bowl side by side, removing the lid of the jar and tipping the bowl to pour the sticky-looking mush with the help of a spoon into the jar. Lidding that, he walked past Harry, bringing with him the sharp smell of herbs and propped the now full glass container on the mantelpiece.Harry thought that the man would continue to make another balm or medicine. But instead, he dug into one of the book cabinets, pulling back the spines. Harry watched with some curiosity before quickly becoming bored, moving towards the table to eye the objects he found so peculiar once more. That is, until Snape returned, dropping a book, newspaper and the small blackboard and chalk they used in his hands carelessly."Learning starts with the fundamentals of language, that is, the alphabet. However-" and he tapped the book in Harry's arm with a finger, "It does not stop there. Today, for the whole of one hour, you will read the newspaper. For the next, you will be copying down said articles in order to improve your atrocious scrawl into a comprehensible text. Well? Begin!"And so for the next hour, while Snape constantly moved around the lab, working diligently on something or other, Harry was hunched over the newspaper on his lap, finding it difficult to be comfortable on the wooden chair and frequently craning his limbs from side to side for it.By the end of the first hour, Harry was bored with stories of a series of houses catching fire in Blackpool, the lack of development when it came to the search of Sirius Black, and the usual rubbish advertising that went into the papers, all written in words Harry, most of the time, only pretended to understand for fear of being shamed for it.Dropping the paper on the floor at the sound of the clock, Harry stretched his arms above his head. A hand messaging his sore muscles, he turned to face Snape, who was still working delicately with the scales. He hadn't acknowledged the clock. And Harry, with prior experience, wasn't willing to remind him of it.And so, Harry moved on to the more laborious task. Copying down the articles proved to be fun, at first. The chalk moving rather smoothly on the material and composing some fine letters. But at the end of the first fifteen minutes, it had lost all fun and after half an hour, a throbbing pain was surging from his wrist.He looked up, hoping to catch Snape taking a break, but disappointedly turned back to his chalk and board.He almost jumped up when the chime came, ringing exactly eight times.But Snape hadn't ceased to work.Harry looked around in uncertainty, for what he didn't know, but hoping that Snape would take notice. Five minutes passed. Harry waited some more, telling himself to wait for another five. Ten, fifteen and at seventeen, when it appeared Snape wouldn't be stopping his work, Harry chose to interrupt him when he was walking towards the cabinets."Excuse me, sir?"Snape's head jerked up from the paper he was holding. Harry felt as though he had disturbed an injured animal with fright. If animals could declare such emotion, that is, with paling features and ghastly wide eyes."S-sir?"But with a shake of his head, Snape, the usual Snape, was back."Yes, Mr Potter?""Two hours are through, sir.""Pardon?"Harry pointed at the clock hung above the chimney, "Two hours, sir. It's over. I've completed the work."Snape's thin lips first parted some, before pressing into a thinner line all together. He walked back to the table and dropped the papers into a neat pile. Work now abandoned, he unknotted the apron, changing it above the chair that had pressed against Harry for the last two hours. Relinquishing any other objects he bore, he strode towards the stairs. Only a vague gesture ushered Harry to follow.Once out the door, Snape waited for Harry to do the same before closing the door behind him. And a few strides later, they were out another door and staring into the back garden."Sir?" Harry asked, noting how the dark bags under Snape's eyes had grown prominent, "What are we doing?"Snape regarded Harry with a side-glance, and seemed to be doing the same with the words Harry had spoken. Probably considering them to be foolish. Silly incantations, he imagined Snape saying, remembering the word from one clipping. But he didn't. Instead, Snape bent down and sat on one of the steps, hands wrapped above his knees.Harry almost reached to catch him, surprised by the unceremonious way he collapsed on the stone, and after a brief look from Snape, he too sat down.A comfortable silence fell around the two.Harry didn't know why. And was sure Snape didn't either. But the silence of their words, filled instead with the ambience of the street behind them and the passing breeze was nothing short of calm.Snape broke it just as Harry's mind became soothed by it, but he couldn't find it in him to be mad."Potter-" Harry looked up, pulling his feet closer, "-I am little less than inclined to be impatient, and your… proceedings this week have very nearly exhausted my endurance. And so, until I say otherwise, it is in both our favor for you to listen to me speak."Harry nodded, feeling entirely guilty and partially unwanted."You've summarised your tale rather loosely. I have no words in regards to it, but press you to be more cautious around the usage of writing utensils."Harry stared, and Snape cleared his throat, "On the request of Professor Patel.""She told you?"Snape smirked, "Among a few things. Must have slipped it in between scolding me to take my shoes off."This time, Harry grinned along, extending his legs so the heels of his shoes were touching the soil.Another comfortable silence."She's grown fond of you, I gather."Harry inclined his head, but Snape wasn't eager in meeting his eye. His gaze was pinned on the vegetable patches and keen on keeping them right there."Isn't she with everyone?""Only those she scolds or trusts enough to laugh around, I hear."Harry shuddered, the laughter suddenly echoing in his ears, "It's terrifying, for a lady such as her. Or a lady at all! I can only think of that lunatic Black laughing with that voice.""What?""What?"Snape, amusingly, looked to be too confused on what sentence to be confused about. Eyes narrowing and lines forming from consternation, before giving up completely and changing the subject."Are you informed of what happened after your disappearance?""Only v-v-vague details," Harry said, testing yet another word he had read and learned the definition of, "Will you tell me of them?"Snape nodded, dropping his hands to his sides, "In short, your Uncle and his sister, as I later discovered during our discussion, wrought havoc in the shop. Demolished the stock, stripped the wallpapers and broke the windows. I arrived from my house visit to find them being escorted by officers, and alerted the Patel's after sensing your absence. There was a trial, and the two had to pay a fine and make up for the loss, which was also provided by the insurance company. Your disappearance was brought up, and Vernon Dursley agreed for you to work for me until your efforts repay the debt,"It wasn't anything different from what the Patel siblings had told Harry (besides the past part), so he merely nodded along."Also, I have utilized the opportunity to notify the appropriate authorities of your previous master. Last I heard he's been escorted to trial as well, and your friends placed together into an orphanage."At that, Harry's head shot up. A bolt of shock, which later shifted into joy and irritation struck through him and he pushed himself up to stand in front of Snape."You're only telling me this now?" he cried, throwing his arms to the side."You had gone deaf, as I recall. Charmed to know that is no longer the case.""Well, I-" Harry began, but stopped fumingly at the amused look he received from Snape, "Will you please at least tell me which orphanage they were taken to?""That I do not know.""What? How could you not-""I am not all-knowing, Potter, though I admit I have often wished to be. However, provided you answer some of my questions, I am more than willing to find out their location."Harry's shoulders dropped, and the next of his words came with much hesitance and in a restless whisper, "And if I'm uncomfortable with your questions?""I will do my best to steer the conversation to a topic you're more comfortable with."Running a hand through his messy hair, Harry weighed his options for some time. His gaze fluctuating throughout the garden and hands refusing to remain still. But at the end of his contemplation, he gave a stern nod."Fine. Ask away," he said, sitting once again on his previous spot.Snape turned to face him, his long legs pulled under him and back rigid, "I'm aware that you have run away shortly after your relative's arrival, but can you expound on what exactly urged you to take flight?""I don't understand, Professor.""To give an example," Snape rubbed his chin with his finger that held a thin, long scar; eyes searching the garden, "Was it some statements they made? A particular threat? Fear of punishment? Guilt for… hurting your aunt?"Harry's hands froze in his lap, and his mouth felt too dry, too soon. He licked his lips for good measure. No words emerged, though, and Snape must have sensed his distress, because he continued."Hurt, as in the reaction to ginger she inhaled, swallowed and had her skin exposed to. There is little medical research, in the matter. But it is common knowledge that particular substances may not agree with particular individuals. Your aunt is no longer in danger."Not dead. Harry released a shaky breath at the thought, body sagging in its own accord and not too soon."You have yet to answer my question, Mr Potter."Harry laughed shakily, "I don't know, sir. I-It was an accident. I didn't mean to throw the ginger jar… She lunged at me, and at that moment, the jar flew out of my hands and Aunt Marge collapsed against the jars. A few of them dropped and when I smelled one-" he cut of abruptly, finding it difficult to go on with the sudden tightness in his chest and dizziness in his head, "There was t-this smell… Sharp, and tingly in the tongue. Sour. It- It smelt like… It was her, Professor, and when I… I ran away, and I wasn't myself anymore. I didn't know where I was, what I was doing… completely...cold and-""Easy, Potter. There are a few things I don't understand," Snape stopped him when Harry began to heave, holding out his hands in front of the shaking boy, "So your disappearance was induced by a smell? A sour, sharp smell?"Harry nodded jerkily."And this smell, which turned you unresponsive, numb and confused, reminded you of an individual?"Another, somewhat uncertain, nod. Individual, yes, but more than that. A memory."Who was it, Mr Potter?"Pressing his lips together, Harry dropped his head."Potter.""My aunt. Other aunt. Uncle Vernon's wife, Aunt Petunia," he managed to say between breaths, looking at Snape with burning eyes, "Is that all?"Snape looked ready for more questions, but sighed and shook his head. And grateful, Harry didn't wait a second to follow the man back inside the house, a looming feeling suggesting that their conversation was far from over.Please excuse any historical inaccuracies you might find, and let me know so I can change them.I can't say when the next update might be, because my laptop is in repairs and even though chapter 9 is halfway through, it's very awkward and I really need to rewrite it. Hope to see you soon, though.salam!

Sorry for the delay. My laptop was at repairs and unfortunately wont br coming back. I have to make do with my phone. Enjoy :)Back inside, Harry lifted his materials from the wooden chair and sat down. Behind him, Snape was getting ready to continue working. Harry waited until he wore the apron tied around his thin waist, and spoke."Will you explain something to me, sir?"Snape turned around, hands still behind his back, "And what would that be, Mr Potter?""It's about, well, I suppose it's about both of us."Snape swept his hair back and tied it into a messy loop behind his head, "I'm afraid you will have to expound on that, Mr Potter.""I meant to ask you…" he clumsily fiddled with the chalk, finger tips white with the dust, "You didn't explain why you didn't tell me you knew me. I would like to know why you did that...I think," he added the last part after seeing the look on Snape's face, which was a mixture of confusion and frustration, a raise of a brow daring him to go on."Will you be content with any answer I give, so long as it is the truth?""Content, sir?""Satisfaction, Potter. Of the answer. Well, will you?"Harry eyed the book in his hands, passing it from one to the other, the worn cover spelling out a foreign word. Snape hadn't done anything remotely close to Edwin or Un-... Snape was alright. Harry lifted his head and nodded, shuffling the book to his other hand."So long as it's the truth, sir.""In that case, it was nothing more than a failure of my own will," Snape said, crossing his arms tightly over his chest and upon seeing the confused look on Harry's face, continued sternly."Partially, my reason was to make sure it was really you. Another obstacle soon came forth, however, as I did not know how to explain the situation to you; revealing your parentage and your history without invoking suspicion or mistrust on your side," he paused, voice getting slower and slower. Hands gripping the counter, he tapped along the wood long after he continued, "I had the idea to notify a close acquaintance who was well involved with your matters, of your existence. That is, until you ran away, and it would hardly be appropriate to write to him after a second disappearance, one which I have some part in."Harry's hands curled around the newspaper, meddling the words together. The letters were as comprehensible as the feeling in his chest now. Taking a deep breath, he spared himself a few moments of silence. His surroundings pulled back into a smudge of colour, and his emotions oddly reminded him of those he felt at the Leaky Cauldron.Guilt, fear, anger. Memories he refused to think about. Emotions he didn't want to feel. The paper crumpled further in his hands, and he stashed it behind him while he made a forceful stand."Thank you, sir," he muttered under his breath, lifting the chair to pull it across the room, right below a line of herbs hung by some string."The conversation has just started, Mr Potter," Snape's voice carried across the room, right as Harry opened the book, the light filtering from the panes catching the dust in the room.Harry closed the book, balancing it on the sewn knee of his pants, "What else is there to talk about, sir?""Aren't you concerned about the following weeks, child? About the steps we ought to take from this day forth?""I… I didn't- that is, it didn't come to my mind.""Clearly," Snape drawled, lifting a hand towards Harry, "Chasing something, or in this case someone isn't a plausible method."Harry bit his tongue, book lifting up and down with his jumping knee, "What is that supposed to mean?""What it means entirely. Now-" he pulled out a fresh piece of paper, scrawling something sharply across its length, "We will have to write a letter to Professor Dumbledore -yes that is his name do stop gaping, Potter- and arrange for a visit. I daresay he'll be drunk with joy upon the recent news."Harry watched Snape's ink pen carving across the page, fast yet diligent. The motion continued until the end of the page, at which Snape lifted his ink pen and lay the paper to dry. He wondered if he'd be able to write like such one day. Pen in hand, with more words at his disposal than he and his friends combined.Not long into this dream, Snape pushed away from the table. Sauntering toward one of the cabinets, he slid his hands across the spines of books before stopping to retrieve one.Harry didn't need to wait long to see what it was, as Snape dropped it across his lap soon after."Ma… ma-tha-ma-tic-s?""...Close enough. It's pronounced mathematics.""Right," Harry agreed, lifting the cover for a look inside, "What is mathematics, Professor?""Mathematics, Potter. Stop pronouncing the the so harshly. And to answer your question-" Harry very nearly caught his fingers between the pages he was leisurely turning when Snape slid his own between the pages and managed to open to where 'Unit One' began, "-it's the knowledge of numerals and their functions. Remember the numbers, Potter?"Harry gave a curt nod."This-" he tapped on the page with a sharp nail, "-is their usage."Flipping through the book, Harry found that in addition to the numbers, there also were foreign symbols indicating what to do with the given combination of numbers. Harry lifted his head, book still open in his hands."When did you get this, sir?""The day of your disappearance. I was planning on walking you through a slower pace, but now, with the recent developments, I have changed my mind."Not paying much mind, Harry skimmed through the pages, filling the room with the rough sound of rifling paper."We'll just have to consider this a part of your punishment, Mr Potter."Harry's finger made a sudden slip down a page's side. With a yelp of pain, he stood up abruptly, book flying to the floor and was just about to put his now bleeding and stinging finger into his mouth when Snape's hand wrapped around his wrist.Heart drumming against his chest, Harry meekly lifted his eyes to Snape's. He wasn't looking at Harry, though, black eyes pinned on Harry's finger. Harry followed his gaze to the throbbing skin, wincing at the cut and the blood sliding down."Refrain from such action in the future, Potter," he said, this time meeting Harry's gaze, which Harry averted immediately.With a sigh, Snape dragged Harry towards the table, leaving the boy to walk towards the drawers. In his absence, Harry squeezed his finger, biting his lip as to not groan at the throbbing pain.Snape taking hold of his wrist again was distraction enough, until the blood was wiped from his skin.Snape squeezed a small cloth over the open cut, lifting Harry's other hand and placing them around the cloth for him to do the same.Harry applied the pressure as Snape let go, a tired look on his face, "What am I to do with you, Potter?"Not punish me, perhaps?Harry swallowed thickly, suddenly too afraid. His shoulders tightened even further when Snape bent down to his short height. Snape tilted his head, and Harry lowered his head, persistent in not meeting his eye."Potter," Snape said dryly, his voice disturbing the silence of the room, "Look at me."Playing with the ends of the patched cloth, "Why?" Harry answered quickly without much thought, voice tight."Because…" Snape said flatly, sounding on the edge of saying something unpleasant, "Because, Potter, I said so."That, of course, wasn't enough reason for Harry to comply.Snape must have understood, because with a swift movement, he pulled Harry's chin between his fingers and forced it up to meet his eyes.Harry's heart jerked uncomfortably, his hair standing up in a spike of fear. Snape looked to be searching for something, his dark eyes alight from the filtering sunlight above, which highlighted just how greasy his hair was. And while Harry waited for those black eyes to stop dwelling on Harry's own, he couldn't help the gradually rising fear and… well, wasn't that odd? Harry felt sad. Harry felt bloody awful. His lips trembled, just above Snape's cold fingers and shoulders tight with tension and fear hung down, slagging like his posture.The years of memories came storming down in his mind, and Harry wanted to cry.The nights in the cupboard. The lonely days. All those times he wanted some warmth, and those times he chased after his family, his cousin especially, in the hope for a friend. He had found them once, in the dwellings of the backstreets and freezing cellars, only to lose them once again. Here, again, he was lonely and afraid, with emotions he never had to deal with before. Guilt, hatred. Why he wasn't enough for his family, and why he couldn't be enough now.Harry wanted to cry.And he did.The burning in his eyes poured out into silent tears, sliding down his cheeks, down his jaw and dripping to his cloth.Drip, drop.All the while Snape stared at him, hand frozen and eyes going as wide as they possibly could. Harry didn't have much to look at after that. With his head hanging low and shoulders slouched, he was mindlessly staring at his shoes while his tears fell.He felt so weak. So cold. He didn't want to get punished. Not for this. Not for something he didn't mean to do."Potter?""P-please, sir I- Maybe you could, I just think-""Potter.""I-I really didn't mean… you know I wanted to come back but I just, and with my family I couldn't-"Potter if you'd just listen-"Harry sniffed, wiping his nose with the back of his hand, "I'm sorry, sir. I really am. I know I do terrible things. Things I shouldn't do. I just… I'm so…" and at that, he lifted his head, looking right into Snap's eyes, tears falling fast, "I-I mess up! I feel so angry, at you and everything. My friends are away, I have such a good-good place with you and I don't feel I deserve it. I know I-" he sobbed harshly at this, hiding his eyes behind his hands, shoulders pulled into his body, the light in the room suddenly too bright, "I let them to this. I let them in! I br-broke, I know the promise I wasn't supposed to break and I did! I hate that I did so, and I'm sorry but please, sir… do-don't punish me, please."For a while, there was only his sobbing. Dry heaves, the wiping of tears that refused to fall and the light from the panes shut out by a veil of clouds, as though to match his mood. Snape was still quiet. Too quiet. It came to a point where, out of concern, Harry looked up and found that he was merely regarding him with a flat, neutral gaze.Harry ducked his head, and urged himself to stop crying."Are you through?" Snape asked, and Harry gave a jerky nod. With a sigh, Snape rose from his crouch and slid a hand into his breast pocket, shaking the object he had retrieved under Harry's eyes.Harry took the handkerchief without Snape needing to say anything, wiping his eyes and nose.He offered to give the handkerchief back. Once again, Snape refused."There wasn't any need for such theatrics, Potter, as they won't get you anywhere with me."Harry's head shot up, an unattractive noise coming from his neck. Snape's brows were pulled down, and his hands were tightly folded across his chest."But sir-""This act might have worked with-" Snape cut himself off, lips still parted. Harry tried to work out what made the man pause, his brows knitted tightly close. Just as quick it had come, however, the expression was gone.The light returned as Snape continued."You are to listen to me very closely, Potter, as I won't repeat myself. Am I understood?"Harry nodded, albeit hesitantly, and looped his hands behind his back.Snape shifted from his spot, one finger lifting to point at Harry sharply, "As compensation for your actions during this past week, you will be responsible for a list of tasks. I am going to list them now. Listen well," and before Harry could remember what the word 'compensate' meant, Snape was already continuing with the list."I will wake you at precisely six in the morning, after which you will tend to the garden; may it be weeding and watering the vegetable patches, or even cleansing the water closet or ridding the dust from the laboratory's windows, as they tend to collect dirt at a profound speed. This will continue until eight, at the very least. I will prepare a small breakfast, you shall clean the cutlery and bowls afterwards. And finally, for exactly four hours each day, you will busy yourself with studies."Harry's mouth fell open, his eyes growing wide and in his obvious surprise, the handkerchief drifted to the floor."Of course, this time may possibly change in the future, perhaps increasing to six hours by the end of the week," Snape muttered the last part to himself, and Harry barely heard him from the buzz in his ears. Surely this couldn't be his punishment? It was more along the lines of a gift! Four hours each day to perfect his reading, what else could Harry ever ask for!He didn't hear the rest of Snape's monologue, but when he was finished, and asked if Harry had understood everything, Harry gave an enthusiastic nod and was ready to hug the man.He didn't, of course. But one could always dream."Before you resume your studies, however, I have one final thing to share with you."Harry sat down as Snape gestured with a hand, Snape himself leaning on the desk with his back to it.Lifting an empty jar from the table, Snape slid his fingers down it's side, stopping at around the middle to look at Harry, "We have a schedule, this week. I'm afraid the shop lost some important stock, many thanks to the stampede of those two oafs."Harry ran a hand down his arm, cheeks burning."This week, the shop will be kept open until past noon. During this time, while you busy yourself with your chores and studies, I will work on orders given to me by clients. At two in the afternoon, do not be surprised to find that I will be making house visits.""House visits, sir?""I am not merely a chemist, Mr Potter. I am familiar with some medical knowledge, and exercise it with those I can help with the materials I have here," he gestured around the laboratory with one hand, jar sitting firm in the other, "Though I don't doubt I'll have much to do this week. However, should that occur, I cannot take you with me, and we will have to find someone to temporarily keep an eye on you."Harry nodded, leaving his seat to pick up the fallen objects, "Is that all, sir?"Again, Snape looked to have some words to say. Instead, he ran a hand through his hair, placing the jar back on the table, "For now. Oh, and expect the acquaintance I spoke of -Headmaster Dumbledore- to pay us a visit sometime in the following weeks. Do you have any questions?""Yes," Harry said, squinting at the mathematics book and lifting it for a clear look, "Will you be teaching this to me yourself, sir?""Do you find any other candidates, Mr Potter?""I thought you taught only che-che, uh…""Chemistry?" Snape offered, looking rather amused at Harry's confusion, the side of his lips lifting up, "True, Mr Potter, though you can trust me to teach you some basic mathematics."Dropping the books on the chair, Harry walked closer to Snape. The light was back, now, and crawling down the walls of the laboratory, softly illuminating the floor. Taking a deep breath, Harry stepped out of the path of the light and with as much courage as he could collect (which really wasn't much) Harry asked, "Will you teach me chemistry?"The question must have been far more intrusive than Harry imagined, because Snape's expression became odd and he seemed to regain some colour to his cheeks."Excuse me?""Chemistry, Professor," Harry continued because Snape hadn't scolded him yet, winding his fingers between the folds of his shirt, "I am sort of… well, chemistry looks interesting. And after I repay the debt, I have to leave, and I want to learn as much as I possibly can while with you."The colour Snape's cheeks had gained fell immediately, and his lips were pulled into a thin line. His silence continued for a minute, leaving Harry nervous and considering stepping back from the request. He opened his mouth to do so, the words fresh in his mouth-"I will be pleased to teach you, Mr Potter."And for now, perhaps it wasn't bad, after all.As promised, Snape woke Harry dreadfully early from an already poor sleep. The sky was a murky grey colour, too early as to be morning, too bright as to still be night.Once Snape was out the room, confident Harry wouldn't fall back to sleep, Harry pushed himself clumsily up from the bed. The sheets were, as always, tangled around his body, half dangling to the floor.Cautious to not crumple to the floor, Harry rose unsteadily, mouth hurting from the yawns he couldn't stifle. Dreadfully early, this was. He was used to waking up early, back at the cellars, but after his little excursion to Diagon Alley, where he could rise at whatever hour he pleased, he found it difficult to fall back into the prior schedule. Yes, dreadfully early…With a scowl, he pulled off his night-shirt, shrugging on the tattered shirt Snape had offered for the garden work.Snape met him in the parlor once he was ready."I expect you no earlier than eight," he dully stated, sweeping past him and into his room.With a sigh, Harry disappeared down the stairs, almost tripping as he did so, further dampening his sleep-deprived mood.The garden, in actuality, didn't need much work. Getting a bucket, Harry placed it under the pump. The pump creaked threateningly as he pulled on the lever, jarring his ears. The rust was starting to grow past the pipe and into the screws, and while it didn't stop the freezing water from pouring down, Harry was still concerned.Despite the backsplash of water on his pants, Harry wrapped both hands around the handle. It didn't come easily, as he wanted, the water surging inside the pail in thick spurts. Harry took a breath, steadying his feet and heaving the handle.Hands on his hips and back aching, Harry swept a quick gaze over the garden patches, a frown forming. From what he could see (and it often wasn't much) some weeds were growing beside the potatoes. He shrugged. Harry had to often do yard work, back… then, and pulling up his sleeves and getting his hands dirty wasn't always boring. And so, he did exactly that. With shirt-sleeves and pant-legs rolled up, and shoes pulled off, Harry Potter was soon crawling around the vegetables, snatching any nasty weeds on his path.All alone, not a soul watching from a particular window up in the house.His hands soiled and sweat dripping from the side of his face, Harry soon stood up, a sharp grin on his lips. He had done well, he prided himself, and it hadn't taken long either. His satisfaction didn't survive long, however, as he stumbled on the bucket, dropping down with it. It was only half-full once he righted it and his pants were smeared with mud.Right. Punishment, Harry remembered crossley, jerking his hand out of the mud. Some awful, great punishment.Two hours later, a very dirty Harry placed the bucket in its rightful place, treading over the grass barefoot. Oddly enough, Snape met him by the backdoor, tapping his foot impatiently on the floor."Are you certain you haven't gone for a swim in the mud instead?" he tiredly asked, running a hand down his face, "One day upon your return, and you're in need of a bath already.""I didn't bathe at Diagon Alley, sir," Harry added, thinking it would have helped. It didn't. And Snape responded with his face taking a very interesting expression."Well," he spoke, voice laced with disgust and a mild touch of regret, "A picnic, I suppose. Wait here. And if you value your life-" he gave him a sharp glare, "-do NOT come in."Harry didn't, but he still sat down on the wood. Swinging his legs under him, he savored the feeling of the grass tickling the soles of his feet until Snape came back with a bowl of oatmeal, forbidding him from eating until he had washed his hands.The rest of the day continued as though Harry hadn't left. He did take a bath, eventually, and had to wash his muddy clothes, wearing his spare pair of pants afterwards while down at the laboratory, working on mathematics, reading and, towards the end of the afternoon, chemistry.And though Harry didn't admit it, he knew he wasn't subtle in hiding his smile, which would crack through occasionally. But if Snape saw it, he didn't comment. And when he bid the Professor good night, he was still smiling into his pillow, wrapped tightly in the warm blankets.All until he woke up from a nightmare, the night still dark, scratching his arms back to sleep…The next morning was profoundly ordinary until after noon, when, instead of having a second chemistry lesson (the first included an introduction into atoms), Snape sent Harry to his room to get ready, as he had a house visit to make. Harry met him downstairs, taking his jacket from where it hung on Snape's arm. Snape waited until Harry had his cap on, his scar out of sight, before opening the door onto the bustling street and locking it behind them.Twice, for good measure. Probably for emphasis.Without sparing another look, Snape pocketed the keys, his coat billowing behind him while he made his way down the street."Do keep up, Mr… Evans," he called above his shoulder, facing back to the street as Harry stepped forward. Harry didn't pester him about the use of Lily's maiden name, thinking it to be Snape's paranoia of someone recognizing him in the street. Well, Harry couldn't see anyone in this street recognizing him, engaged as they were in both shopping and conversation. He didn't pay much mind to them, though. Thinking about his mother had brought some memories back from reading the book. Specifically the parts he couldn't bring himself to finish, leaving his heart clenched and eyes burning.He didn't cry as they turned right to the stairs that led up to the familiar neighbourhood of Professor Patel's home.He came very close when she opened the door."I wasn't expecting you this soon," she said with a smile, opening the door wider, "You're very lucky I'm home.""Indeed," Snape agreed, urging Harry forward with a hand on his shoulder, "May we both come in? I won't be long, but I would like to speak with you. Privately."She nodded, though Harry noticed her fingers tensing as she held open the door. Inside, Professor Patel stopped Harry before he could take another step, nodding to his shoes."Oh, of course," he muttered, ears burning. Wrestling his shoes off, he lined them right before the small carpet began, his socks sliding on the fabric."You know the way, Harry," Professor Patel said, stepping beside him and sliding his shoes into an empty slot, "I'll meet you there shortly."Harry glanced between the two with interest, curious of what they would talk about. It would concern him, no doubt, and Harry would much rather hear what adults had to say about him.Snape nodded towards the hallway, noting his gaze, "I'll be back for you soon, Potter. Granted, you may not like your punishment, but I have no intention of lifting it yet," he said, and turned to face Professor Patel, finishing their conversation.Turning his back to them, Harry started down the hall, the hushed voices of the professors' following him.Entering the living room, Harry sat down on the armchair. Sitting didn't help much, however. His nerves were rising at random intervals, making him tap his foot on the floor with uneven passes. Licking his lips, Harry pushed himself up from the chair and marched towards the wooden bookcases on the other side of the room.There weren't many things on display. A few books, some trinkets, and one single photograph of a family of four (the Patels, no doubt), yellow along the edges, though the date on the bottom was only ten years back.Harry moved along, hand collecting dust as he dragged it over the wood before coming to a section behind a glass shutter, which held what looked to be a small stack of newspapers.Not in the desire to get into any major trouble in the foreseeable future, Harry pulled his hand back from the handle. The newspapers could wait, and so could Harry.Both didn't wait long. Some five minutes later, Professor Patel joined Harry in the room, a strained smile on her face."Welcome one again, Harry," she greeted, motioning toward the sofa, "Have a seat."Harry shuffled his feet, glancing at the newspapers from the side of his blurry vision as he sat down."Are you always at home, Professor Patel?" Harry asked, still stealing the occasional glance at the newspapers, hoping she'd notice.She gave an odd sort of nod and scratched her cheek, "Very nearly. I don't have much to do outside except for shopping errands. Cleaning and aiding my brother takes much of my time.""Will he…" Harry began, choosing his words carefully before dropping the matter entirely, "Nevermind. Uh, what will I be doing, today?"Professor Patel straightened on her seat, joining her fingers in her lap, "I had the idea that we might talk, if you'd agree.""Talk about what?""Oh, many things," she said, lifting a hand and gesturing towards him, "You, your stay with Professor Snape, to give an example. Have you anything in mind?"Harry frowned, gazing at the glass case as to distract her, "Not anything interesting enough."To his relief, Professor Patel followed his gaze to the glass, a smile of understanding lifting her lips. With a smooth stand, she stepped towards the case, her skirts sweeping over the floor. She gestured him closer, and Harry moved beside her, glad he didn't need to indulge in conversation yet.Opening the case, Professor Patel slipped her finger under the first newspaper and closed it again. Her hold was gentle, as though the newspaper would tear at the smallest wind. Harry took it with both hands, glad to have something to read other than the boring book Snape had given him.His eyes went wide."This says… New York Times. New York? Isn't that in-""The United States? Precisely," Professor Patel said rather proudly, "My father is there at the moment. He sends letters. I ask him to send newspapers. Very valuable, news from the other nations," she then went on to run a finger down the spine of each newspaper, naming the counties as she went."These are from the United States. This hefty pile comes from South Africa, and the final pile from a multitude of countries, including France. Too bad I cannot understand much of it," she said, leading him towards the sofa."When did this arrive?" Harry lifted the one in his hands, reading the date April 10,1874,""Oh, dear… The middle of June, if I remember," she said, holding her chin, "Yes… might be- No, middle of June," she confirmed, nodding along, "Nothing much to read, save for the front page.""What's on the front page?" Harry asked, unfolding the newspaper carefully, feeling as though he was holding something quite valuable, "What is it about?""Why don't you read it?"Harry took off his cap, flattening his hair down, "I'm not a fast reader.""Ah," Professor Patel nodded, coming to sit beside him, she lifted a hand and placed it around the newspaper, her free hand pointing at the title, "Well, the text is overwhelming. In summary, a poor girl - Mary, I think her name is - had to be taken from her adopted mother, as she was being physically assaulted by her. The…" she brought the newspaper closer, searching the column under Inhuman Treatment of Little Waif , "Ah! The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals bought the case, I read, and the adopted mother was charged."Harry was under the impression that she was watching him very closely as she explained. He didn't notice much, though. A sudden cold clenched his bones, and his foot began to tap along the floor. Out of all the newspapers and books, he had picked the one similar to his own… relatives."Harry?" Professor Patel called his name, dropping a hand on his shoulder but pulling it back once he flinched, "Are you alright?"Harry nodded, folding the newspaper unnecessarily harshly and placing it in her open hand, "Yes, uh, poor girl," he agreed, tapping the newspaper, "Hope she is… Hope she found someone to care for her."There was a moment of silence, as Harry didn't know what to say. Unlike yesterday, the cloudy weather cast a gloomy atmosphere, affecting even the house itself. And with the newspaper still in sight, not much kept Harry from twisting his fingers together.Professor Patel took a sharp breath, "I do not want to lie to you, Harry, or sugar coat your predicament, as they say. You're a smart child. I'm sure you already understood the conversation I am trying to make."Harry nodded, wiping his nose with the back of his hand, "You think… you think I had something similar?""Me? No. Not yet," she shook her head, "Professor Snape did, however. He asked me to speak to you about it, as I have experience.""Experience in what?""In speaking to those with similar history.""That is not comforting, Professor."She paused, licking her lips, "Will you let me continue, at least?"Another nod. A sigh of relief from the Professor, poorly hidden."We do not have to have this conversation yet, about you, about your troubles. In fact, I agree that if you are tense, we may continue some other time," Professor Patel said, her usual soft voice grown serious and loud, "I wish to help you, as Professor Snape wishes, for he requested I speak with you on the topic."Harry's head shot up. He found it mildly threatening, having Snape take notice of… well, he didn't know what the man had seen to urge Patel to speak with him, but nevertheless, he felt uncomfortably irritated that Snape hadn't consulted him about it first."So," he managed through a clenched jaw, "We don't have to talk about it now?""I just wanted to have the conversation set, as a reminder for you. Perhaps… yes, a reminder... We can continue another time. But-" at that, Harry looked up again, "-I still want to talk with you. To some extent. So, I will ask a single question, and you may answer however you like, and we'll continue the conversation from there. Is that alright?"Harry wasn't convinced. How could he be? The Professor wanted to talk to him about topics he wasn't comfortable even with thinking of yet. He eyed Patel, biting his lip."What kind of question?"She leaned back on the sofa, hands on her back, "Just this: Who are you, Harry? What kind of person is Harry, for you?"That had, at least, calmed the slowly rising anger in his chest. He'd expected himself to lash out immediately after Patel had started the conversation, demanding it wasn't anyone's business if his uncle… if he…No, he didn't lash out. Instead, he made one terrible decision. Without thinking, Harry answered with an embarrassing tone of confidence."I'm Harry Potter."I have never had PTSD. I do not 100% percent know how to write it. I have done my research, and it wasn't enough, hence why the trauma explored in these 10 chapters are abysmal efforts. I will hopefully do better, as I have researched more thoroughly. On that note, suggestions and constructive criticism is welcome. Thank you for reading! I will do my best to post next Monday. :) Also, the news article is real. Mary Ellen McCormak had to be rescued by the Mentioned society, as she was a 'human animal'. I have tried to find the real newspaper, but have failed, due to the New York Times thrusting after my money. Oh well.

Needless to say, there was little to rival the surge of expressions that twisted Professor Patel's face.Harry recognised a few. Only a few. Because between finding amusement in a situation that wasn't funny at all and the undoubted wrath he'd face with Snape, there could be only so much he could think.It wasn't funny at all, yet the darkened cheeks of Patel were all it took to get Harry to laugh, and her stumbling words only ensured his chuckles."That is- entirely…what?" she asked, voice thin, weak. Entirely foreign. She stood up, her fingers pressing against her parted lips, "You're not lying?"Smile and laughter abruptly cut, Harry played with his finger, "I am," he tried, trying to keep his voice from shaking.He doubted it did any good.His weak lie couldn't mask his previous laughter, or the flatness of his tone, and Patel's pressed lips told him as much.She didn't comment. Instead, Harry flinched back when a hand fell on the curve of his forehead."May I?"And she lifted the strands of thick black, gently as though it would tear. Then came a sharp intake of breath, a hand dropping down at the same time Harry averted his gaze."Ya Allah.." she tapped along her arm, voice losing its strength until she made an unexpected stand, her arms flying to her sides, "You're alive!""Uh," Harry eyed the door, "I suppose I am.""How are you alive?""I've been wondering the same thing, actually. And if someone other than Alexanderia Alexander is willing to tell me the story, I'd love to hear it!"Patel didn't tell him much, as she believed him to be dead, too. They did fall into a lengthy conversation, however, in which Patel scolded a Snape who wasn't there until Harry reassured her Snape had written to the, uh, Dumble-bore bloke - Dumbledore, Harry - and told him of Harry's existence.There wasn't much talk, that day. At least, nothing about Harry's… unpleasant past. Instead, Professor Patel woke her brother, who was sleeping in the next room, and she and Harry helped Mr Patel cook an early meal, falling into comfortable conversations that carried on into the table.Harry found it hard to concentrate on his Shakshuka, and harder to listen to the Patels, eyeing his egg uncomfortably. The attempt to get him earlier had opened the opportunity for unwanted thoughts. Uncle Vernon, Uncle Petunia… the cupboard looming behind their screaming figures. Harry tried to shake his head free of the thought, the fork scraping the bowl as he did so. He dropped the fork, ending the ongoing conversation between the two. Head hanging down, Harry bit down on his lip, fingers itching over the shirt over his arms.Professor Patel spoke first."Harry?" her voice called from in front of him, losing her previous excitement, "Would you like a different meal?"Feeling foolish and rather ashamed, Harry shook his head, spooning some of the eggs and taking a measly bite, "It's delicious," he told Mr Patel, nodding with a smile, "Thank you."He was relieved when Mr Patel offered him a wink over his water cup, ripping some of the semi-dry bread and using it to take a bite from the meal. Professor Patel, however, gave a frown, one that was hard to understand, and even harder to dismiss as it quickly lifted into a smile once Harry faced her.The rest of the meal held no conversation with him. Mostly because he only bothered answering with short replies and gestures. Mostly because he couldn't bring himself to. His hunched shoulders, his undying rapid heartbeat…and under both, a terrible mixture of storming emotions that was still brewing at the end of the meal.Professor Patel assured him and Mr Patel both that she'd take care of the cleaning up, as she couldn't help with the cooking and ushered them into the living room while she began her chore in the kitchen."She's a terrible cook," Mr Patel said once they were inside and it seemed unlikely that Harry would talk."What?"Mr Patel nodded towards the door, a small smile on his lips, "Aisha. She's a terrible cook, and almost set umi's kitchen on fire."Harry smiled unintentionally, the image of a frantic Aisha pouring a jug of water over the fire coming to mind, "Is the one you're calling umi your… mother?""Yes. The same mother who caught her scarf on the fire while Aisha tried to stop the table from burning. Pati wouldn't ask for water from her for a month. That's when I started to help umi in the kitchen."Harry laughed, imagining a very cautious Snape not asking him to do any chores under similar circumstances before deciding that he'd have more chores to do if he ever burnt the kitchen."I can cook too," Harry said, his heart still beating and emotions still at large, but easing with every word, "But I don't think Sn- Professor Snape trusts me to.""I can tell," Mr Patel said, stretching his arms."You can tell he doesn't trust me?"Mr Patel blinked before his eyes widened in understanding, "Oh, no! You are a good cook. Even though you only cut the onions and tomatoes. My sister doesn't help me with those.""Can't she use a knife?"Mr Patel waved a dismissive hand, a sharp smile on his lips while his head turned to the door, "She doesn't like her eyes burning, and says the onions smell worse than my socks."Letting out a laugh, Harry felt the uneasy tightness of his chest loosen as his body shook with small tremors, his tense shoulders relaxing when Mr Patel went on to say he deliberately made his socks smell bad whenever Professor Patel was particularly infuriating."That, however -" he continued with emphasis, eyeing his sister as she came in, carrying with her a small plate, "- Is our secret. Isn't it Harry?"Professor Patel's eyes narrowed at her brother. She walked past him without another look, placing the plate on the free spot beside Harry, "I suppose I won't ask," she said, grabbing a biscuit from the plate and taking a harsh bite, chewing exaggeratingly hard."Mr Patel told me of your brilliant cooking talents, Professor," Harry said, taking an offered biscuit."Did he now?"Mr Patel leaned back in his chair, "Well, brilliant is inappropriate. Though I made no comment on your bakery skills.""You just want a biscuit.""You're my favorite and only baker, roohi,"She did end up giving him a biscuit, which Mr Patel seemed to like but Harry couldn't enjoy as much.The biggest reason was that it held ginger, which Harry had formed a rather blatant hostility against, and that the biscuit felt foreign on his tongue. Unnatural. Like the ginger didn't want to be baked with the sugar and refused to be sweetened, even with the cup of milk Professor Patel offered.He didn't take a second helping until Snape arrived at quarter to five."I apologise to have imposed on you like this," Snape told Mr Patel (Professor Patel couldn't see him off, as the bell had rung while she was busy 'praying' in the parlour).Mr Patel shook his head, "Not at all, Professor.""Are you experiencing any pains?" Snape asked while Harry pulled on his shoes, almost slipping on the steps and feeling his cheeks heat up at the hold Snape got on him without even looking, cutting his fall."Yes. The medicine you gave me is finished, and I noticed Aisha's empty… uh, what was the name of the substance?""The balm?" Snape said without much drawling, clutching Harry's shoulder to prevent him abling away to catch a better look of kids playing at the end of the street short, "Has her skin shown some improvement, at least?"Mr Patel gave a pathetic sort of shake of his head."Very well. I'll see what I can do," he nodded at Mr Patel, turning half-way around, "My regards to your sister," and without loosening his hold on Harry's arm, he marched down the street, feet clicking ominously on the cobblestone."Had an enjoyable time?" he asked Harry while walking down the steps, scattering the few people milling about the bottom, "I suppose your enjoyment makes no difference. They're the only ones I trust you with at the moment."At his silence, Snape let go of his arm, "Anything I should know about, Harry?""We've taken the wrong turn," Harry replied, facing the left street they should have taken instead of the foreign right direction they were heading towards."We're making an improvised visit," he said, facing the street, which was comparably more crowded than the one they usually took, "Answer my question.""Once we take the correct road home, sir, I will."Harry collided with Snape's back. The people around them, who were more interested in making way for Snape rather than cross paths with him, turned their heads to look at the yelp of surprise from Harry. Harry rubbed his nose, looking up at a rigid Snape who still had his back to him."Do not, Mr Potter," Snape began, dangerously quiet and with a thick voice laced tight with rising frustration, "Ever call it that. Understood?"Harry, who was not even looking at his face and had his ears full with the noise of the street and passing carts already took a step back, giving a shaky nod."Yes, sir."Snape continued to walk without another word.The rest of the walk was a mixture of silence and single word orders to stand close whenever Harry lingered far, which sometimes shifted into Snape taking a hold of his arm and dragging him forward by the shoulder.Harry did his best to keep up, futile though it was. He had adopted a particular slide that made it harder for Harry to keep up, often taking twice as many steps to not linger behind.The labyrinth of turns were little comfort. The buildings morphed gradually from the shops and ordinary houses to a much ignored part of town, one Harry didn't want to find himself alone in at night. He shuffled forward, peering at the run-down buildings from under his cap. Hands in pockets, he shuffled forward, turning his head away from the leering, rotting shapes.He didn't see the pit. Harry's foot caught the pothole that split sharply from the road, his feet scuffing under him as his balance faltered. Flapping inelegantly, he regained balance right as Snape turned, throwing his arms behind him while arching his spine back, away from Snape's piercing eyes."I didn't fall," Harry defended himself, lifting his chin yet ignoring Snape's persistent gaze."How convincing," came the unconvinced reply with a roll of eyes.Harry's reply came later, much later, when they made yet another unfamiliar turn onto an unfamiliar road. Snape doesn't notice, though. He doesn't have to. But as they walk into the street, the involuntary warmth of Snape's arm around his shoulders breathes life in Harry's chest. It was so unlike the evening cold seeping under his skin, inspiring a sense of freedom even beside the leering buildings caging them into the narrow alley.And so very alive at the sight of a building across from them. ."I don't believe you," Harry rasps in disbelief. He doesn't leave Snape's side, withholding the excitement that shows itself in dark cheeks and a cracking smile, "You found them."Snape refuses to acknowledge it, and Harry doesn't want him to. They have no words to say to each other, but the letters arching over the iron gates speak enough, more than the newspapers ever can."I have one thing to say, however," Snape stops him beneath the rusty iron, "You may not speak to them directly.""What?"Snape turns his eyes to the wooden doors and Harry follows his gaze. Across the patches of dry grass, beyond cobblestones cracked by dry plants, a large window looms.And behind it a group of children.Snape takes him by the arm, stopping Harry's first step inside and cutting his smile short."Smallpox," Snape says, grim and defeated, "A child has acquired it. They're accepting no visitors.""But my family-""I control no disease, Potter. Believe me."Harry does believe him. But with his family waving behind the window, a smile on each of their faces, the only thing he wants to believe is what he can see. Defeated, he offers a nod to Snape, ducks under his arm as he pushes open the door and gains speed with every step he takes.As he approaches, the vague silhouettes resolve into individual features. Upon his last step, his breath catches in his throat."David?"The smiling boy was others were just as he remembered, soot free, identically clothed with bruises blossoming across their faces."How ya doing, Harry?""How am I doing? What happened to your face?" he asks, frowning at their averted gazes.He couldn't get an answer. Marie suddenly jumped into view, throwing her hands up and screaming loud enough to make Snape wince in obvious agony."Harry! Harry you came back!"He dropped his shoulders, tilting his head while a soft smile slipped to his lips, "Hello, Marie.""Harry, I want to tell you something," she continued breathlessly, pressing both hands on the window, "Mama and Papa are coming back! I prayed, just like you said, and now mama and papa are coming back!"Harry blinked, once, twice. He lifted his eyes from Marie to David, and David pressed his lips together, looking at the other boys who seemed equally lost."Marie," Joe said behind her, patting her awkwardly on the head, "Why don't you show Harry the toy your mama and papa bought you?"Her face lit up brighter than Harry had ever seen. She ordered Harry to not move, pushing past the boys and running down the hall, her dress fluttering behind her.Dress?"Why is she…" Harry hissed, peering into the window, "Why is she dressed like that? And what does she mean by mama and papa?""That's, well, you see-" Joe tried to explain."I tried to tell her but-" David cut in, putting his hand over Joe's mouth only to recoil with a yelp when Joe bit down.Rory pushed them aside, "Oh shut it. Tried to tell them, they say. I say-""You lo' should let me speak," Oliver pushed through, Mums behind him with his hands behind his back, "And don' le' Marie run off like tha' again. The other girls don' look at her nice.""They're jealous," snapped Rory, cradling his hand, glaring at Joe, "They all are.""So were ya, Rory. We all are. Don' look at me funny, Joe.""Stop spitting nonsense then!"David scoffed, leanin on the wall, "Yes, well-"Snape cleared his throat. Immediately, each boy turned towards Snape. Harry, of course, didn't give any reaction. The rest, however, much to Harry's delight fell awfully quiet. And even Rory, who was still complaining about his hand, stashed it behind his back."Is your matron not joining us in the meeting?" Snape asked, moving to stand beside Harry. He wondered if it was intentional. To loom over the children as such, casting a shadow across their faces and terrifying them with ordinary questions asked in unordinary tones."She is kept very busy," Joe whispered, squaring his shoulders and looking elsewhere when Snape faced him, "Elizabeth still has the smallpox. A-and no doctor has come yet, so the matrons don't have time for us... unless sick.""I see," Snape said,looking deep in thought. He took a deep breath, taking a step forward and turning on his heel to face Harry, "Unless you have infinite time, I urge you to be quick about the conversation."Harry nodded, "What were you saying about Marie, Oliver?"Among many things, Harry learned that Marie was being taken in by a family soon, and her soon to be father was to claim her in the following days. In the meantime, they had provided her with clothes and, as Marie showed Harry while jumping up and down, stuffed toys. Harry smiled at her while she could see, but the state of the boys didn't pass unnoticed. At the end, they sent Marie to her bed once more, telling her to rest for her new mama. Marie cried. Snape tried to urge her to bed when they failed to soothe her, and it only made her cry louder, screaming as she ran down the corridor. And Harry realised a few things.They weren't happy. Not at all. They too smiled, when Marie talked to them, though behind them was the strain Harry knew only too well. Jealousy, anger. Harry, too, had often felt the same whenever he came upon a family during his cleaning days. The loneliness, the unfairness of it all. Watching someone own something you could only visit in your dreams. Harry was better now. He knew he was. He was thin, but they were hinner. He had clothes a few sizes too big yet clean. The rest had uneven patches sewn clumsily on their clothes already too small.Harry hung his head, "They're hitting you here, aren't they?"Rory scoffed, earning a glare from Oliver, at which he rolled his eyes."Ya aren't this daft, Harry," Oliver said, stepping closer and pressing a hand on the glass, "'Course they hit us-" his free hand swept down the side of his face, above a fresh bruise yellow around the edges, "Don' think there'd be any who didn't."From the side of his vision, Snape clenched his hand. Harry hunched in on himself, taking a step forward, "Listen," he whispered sharply, drawing them closer with a beckoning of his hand. The group exchanged looks, but huddled their heads closer, bodies pressed together against the window. Harry peeked from above his shoulder, and whispered as loudly as he cold without being heard, "I have a plan.""What plan?" David asked too loudy. That earned a slap on the back of the head from Mums, which all too quickly turned into a scuffle on their side.Harry dropped his hands between his palms, groaning. A hand knocked on the door, pulling him back. Oliver smiled, strained and weary - unforced yet pulled over dry, neglected skin. Harry pressed his own hand over the window, the disease be damned, and smiled, his eyes closing."I'll look after them, Harry."Harry chuckled. Forced, dry, "You can't shoulder everything.""I know.""I have a plan, Oliver. To help us all," Harry whispered, opening his eyes. His other fist was clenched now fueled by whatever emotion was stirring in his chest, and raised his chin, "I will earn money, and I will get us out of here, into that warm house we dreamed of."When it was Oliver's time to chuckle, it slipped past his lips like water through a parted gate. Smooth, welcoming. A clean laugh that Harry wouldn't doubt as anything but real."I trust you, Harry," Oliver said, joining their hands behind the pane.And those words stayed with him long after they left Greenpath Orphanage. The clock pointed past eight, the sky a blossom of dark colours racing past the horizon. At the table, the two ate in silence under the company of the lantern. The orange flames flickered weakly, casting long shadows on the wood. Dropping his spoon in his empty bowl, Harry stood up, sinking deeper into the darkness of the room."May I be excused, sir?""Leave your plate on the counter and wait for me on the sofa," replied Snape, face brimming with darkness, despite a number of lamps placed throughout the room. Harry nodded, steering around the table. Placing the plate on the counter, he poured himself a cup of water from the pitcher and drank it down in one gulp. The cup left beside the plate, Harry passed by Snape and sat himself down on the sofa.It took an infuriating amount of time for Snape to join him in the parlor, unbuttoning his sleeves. The light caught his body with every step, glowing faintly over his dark clothes. And when he sat, Harry thought he caught a glimpse of something dark and large on his arm. Snape pulled his sleeve sharply down, and Harry pretended not to see anything by focusing on the mantelpiece.He narrowed his eyes."The picture is gone."Snape stilled, "What picture?"Harry lifted a hand, pointing at the spot above the mantelpiece where the photo used to be, "The picture of the young woman, under a tree. It's gone. Did you remove it?"Snape let the void of silence do the speaking, the clock chiming in and the late night wind rattling the window. Harry dared not speak. The sky was a messy splash of white dots, as always, too far for Harry to see clearly. He still watched them, though. The blinking lights so far in the distance. And yet, others could see them. Wish upon them. As foolish as the thought was, perhaps Marie's prayer was accepted because she could see them, if she prayed to them at all.Harry turned to Snape. Snape was watching him back, just as careful, face half-concealed in the shadows."Do you pray, sir?"An unanswered moment. Then, a sharp intake of breath, "What brick has your head collided with for you to ask such a thing?"Harry twiled his fingers together, "Marie and I… we spoke, the morning I first came into your shop. Or before coming here. She wanted her mother and father to come back -they're not- well, they died, I think and-""I must have missed the point you're trying to make between the unnecessary amount of sentences you've managed to string together," Snape snapped, "Do draw your conclusion."Harry tapped his fingers unevenly on the sofa, muscles taut, "We both agreed to pray for a family, that morning. For a warm house and warm food and good clothes. She's getting a family now," Harry hung his head, the words hanging his shoulders, "A father, a mother. I think I did it wrong. I prayed, too, just before I fell. But maybe I haven't prayed to the right… thing?""Thing?""Well, the Patels prayed today, too. Doing some odd actions, such as bending down, though Mr Patel sat on the ground… What? Oh, fine, my conclusion is that they prayed 'salah' to God, called Allah. I know some families-" he squeezed his arm, running a nail down the exposed skin, feeling something vaguely familiar to what he experienced that afternoon, "Attend church… But I prayed to… nothing. Is that why my prayer didn't come true?"Snape's response was a sigh, his face lost in the shadows, his cheekbones occasionally visible from swelling candle flames. All quite, lost. Eyes lost in the window, the orange flickering in his black eyes."Sir?""I do not pray, Potter. I do not indulge in such… unpleasantries.""Unpleasantries?""Each to their own, Mr Potter. I do not pray. I do not degrade you or Professor Patel's methods openly. There is little for me to contribute to your views on the matter."Harry shrugged, "If Marie prayed to the stars, I think mine didn't come true because I can't see them.""What?"Harry pushed himself back on the couch.. Snape was close, leaning closer, the lines crossing his face that made him look older than he really was bright in the light. Harry swallowed, clutching the fabric of the sofa, knuckles burinıing."I-I won't pray to the stars next time, sir?"Snape groaned, his scowl cutting sharply into his features, "I was playing at humour, when I said you must have hit your head. I very strongly doubt it is a joke anymore. Do you believe that is the part of the sentence I am critiquing?"Harry did. He didn't admit it, though. Curling into himself, Harry looked down at his toes, "No, sir.""Am I correct to assume you cannot see, Mr Potter?""Only far distances, sir.""And how long have you been like this, Mr Potter?"Harry dug his fingers into his arm, "As long as I could remember sir.""And you have kept this from me why?"Sighing, Harry lifted his head, facing Snape who was now standing very close, a hand on the back of the sofa, "It hasn't mattered before, it doesn't matter now.""It matters to me. What happens in your life concerns me."Harry snorted, "No it bloody well doesn't," he whispered into his arm, turning away from Snape again. That would have been the end of that conversation. Snape would be angry, send Harry to his room and they would fall into their previous routines, as though the incident hadn't taken place. This time, though, Snape didn't shout. Harry preferred for him to shout, to throw a tantrum and leave him alone.The dangerous curl of his low voice, strong with a spitting warmth of irritation was much, much scarier."Excuse me?""I don't matter. Not to you. Not to anyone. The only part of me you're concerned with is the Boy-Who-Lived, not anything else," Harry still challenged, his hands squeezed into fists, heart hammering, mind blaring because this was a terribly foolish mistake.But it was a mistake Harry was willing to make."And you think that is below me?"I think it's below anyone to think my only worth comes from a title I was giving for something I haven't done!" the words escaped, and he didn't try to stop them as they frothed from inside and spat like wild poison, "I think it's below you to keep me here while acting like a sodding bomb!"Snape sprang to his feet, jabbing a finger into Harry's chest, "Watch your mouth with me, Potter.""And you don't even tell me!" Harry shouted through his dry mouth, hands slipping into his hair and pulling them by the roots, "You don't tell me what sets you off, and expect me to keep away.""I expect you to be an obedient stu-" Snape stopped himself, his long fingers curling into a fist, "I expect you to be respectful."Harry laughed, dropping his hands, "You want to control me. That's what you want."Snape took a shaky breath, speaking through gritted teeth, "I am very close to doing something you and I will regret, Potter.""You are like the atoms you told me about. Like that large ele-something table, except you don't know where to belong and no one knows either. You can't decide on how to treat me.""Perhaps it's because you don't know how to act," Snape spat through his teeth, uncurling his finger and waving it in front of Harry's face."Well, it didn't have to be that, did it?" Harry answered, jaw clenched and body shaking uncontrollably, "No one needed to know! You could have gone around, spent your years in peace without me. Dumble-lore didn't need to know! Patel didn't need to know and-"Harry slammed a hand over his mouth, much too late.Snape's hand immediately dropped, his brows lifting. They were down again in only a second, his body bending over Harry, trapping him in the corner of the couch."For your own well being," Snape hissed, the light from behind Harry only darkening his face with menacing shadows, "tell me you haven't told Professor Patel who you are."At his silence, Snape's hand slammed down on the armrest, "Answer me!"At the loud noise, Harry flinched, nails digging into his skin and heart caught in a deathly squeeze. Trembling, Harry shook his head, trying to hide his head in his arms, "I-I'm very sorry, I-"That must have been the fire that set off the bomb. Harry felt a thorned grip around his arm, nails digging into his skin. He shouted, at the sudden pain, but Snape's hold stood tight, unwavering. And as far as Harry's pleas went, they didn't stop Snape from lifting him up.Pulled from the sofa, Snape dragged Harry across the room, not even flinching when Harry's fingers dug into his hand.Eyes already burning, surroundings turning fuzzy, Harry felt the world slipping past his fingers, the hold he had on himself breaking as he was flung into his room.And with a final look at Harry, Snape slammed the door closed, the lock clicking.Leaving Harry alone in the dark.Do I think Snape would hit Harry? No. Do I think this is something he would have done? Honestly, I kinda do. But it's mostly fuled by not wanting to do something worse, in my opinion, and specefically in this situation. Will this be the end of their relationship? Of course not. But Snape needs to comfront his own demons and tgink back on the argument (even if its not clear what Harry is arguing about because lets face it, a) Harry's a child and b) arguments don't make sense most of the time). Anyway, I started chapter 11. Thank you for your comments and reviews, hope to see you next week :)Salam

TW: Flashback and self-harm.I don't know why, but I've forgotten to credit my beta the last few chapters. So thank you, absinthe, for all your efforts.There was no sound in the room, nor light.The minute the door closed, time slipped out of his grasp, sending him back before Snape, before even his makeshift family huddled together for physical and emotional warmth.Harry is still. Much too still.Until he isn't. Until the stillness he so trusted takes such a rapid shift into a drumming heart, Harry feels like he's been toppled over. Nausea and cold dread pools in his stomach creating a vile mixture. One hand over his stomach, Harry manages to regain a little balance before he feels a hot flash strike his body, leaving behind beads of sweat. Cold, hot. Both of them at once and the growing noise from those thumping footsteps flooding viciously in his ears, louder than they actually are. Louder than they should be.He tries the door - once, twice. It doesn't open, and the feeling of being abandoned on a high ledge bites his insides."No, no…" he drops the handle with shaking hands, tugging his trembling fists against his chest, "No!"He takes a step back. Another. Then another. Enough steps to get his back to hit something solid and slip down its length, away from the screams, away from the shouts ringing in his ears. But he can't cry. He won't let himself be heard. So with hands slammed against his mouth, legs, stomach and head throbbing with searing pain, Harry curls up into a ball, away from the screams and shouts of his uncle and aunt in the cupboard under the stairs.The clock in the parlor struck once. Harry stilled, pulling his wet hands from his lips but made no effort to stand up, counting the ringing.One, two, three… ending at exactly ten.Minutes. It had only been minutes. Harry further curled up into himself, hands once more covering his mouth, this time to calm his exhausted breathing.Some stray tears drip past his nose, tapping on the wood underneath him. And only when the half-hour mark rang out, followed by a slamming of a door did Harry pull himself up. His fingers shook still.The window caught his attention. There was no moon, only pale lights barely making it past his window. Harry turned his back to it, stumbling to the bed. What he had experienced… it wasn't there anymore, but it left behind an exhaustion settled in his bones and a hoard of emotions he felt too tired to sort through. Harry shivered, wiping furiously at his eyes. He wouldn't go through this. He refused to go through this. He refused to be angry, to be sad for the things he had caused and refused to be confused about what had happened.But when he felt the memories treading back, he pulled up his sleeve and jarred his chapped nail down his arm. Again, and again and again. Whilst he stood, whilst he laid down and even while the exhaustion, too strong for him to fend off, pulled him into a restless sleep.Morning didn't come when he awoke. The scratching didn't stop. Brief burns flickering down his skin until he was calm enough to sleep.Morning hadn't arrived the second time he woke up either, so Harry, refusing to be angry, fist and jaw clenched, stumbled to the window. It jarred open sharply long enough for Harry to breath in the half-dirty air before walking back to the bed. The cold seeped through the window. He curled up around the blanket, tossing and turning and scratching until the first blue of the morning.And then, he slept.The third time he woke up, the sun was trickling past the window and touching his face, easing him out of his restless sleep.Harry turned to his right, away from the light, covering his face and trying to go back to sleep. It almost worked, until he heard footsteps climbing up the stairs and crossing the parlor without pausing. Harry tensed, squeezing his hands and lying very, very stil.The door opened without the click of a lock, making Harry wonder when Snape had unlocked it. Then, he remembered the windows, how he had left them open during the night and how they were closed now. That didn't comfort him at all. In fact, the idea of Snape entering the room while Harry was sleeping, at his most vulnerable, made him wrinkle his nose and grimace.The footsteps stopped just beside his bed, catching Harry's breath. Just for a second. That's when he remembered to breathe, for the sake of his pretend sleep, taking measured and deep breaths.Harry heard Snape sigh, then the gentle thud of something being placed on the desk near his bed before the footsteps carried out the room, closing the door behind them.There came no click of the lock.It still took Harry long after the footsteps disappeared down the office to lift the blanket, sighing in relief at the cool air that touched his exposed skin and sweaty shirt.And lifting his head, Harry saw a small tray on the table with a small bowl and a spoon aligned neatly on the side, waiting for him. He still felt exhausted, as though the source of all his emotions and energy had been drained to the last drop, leaving him to navigate alone in the drought. Still, he pushed his legs over the side of the bed, shakily walking towards the table and picking up the bowl of porridge.Squeezing his eyebrows, he lifted the spoon, hating himself for being able to stomach the food despite everything that had happened.After the last bite, he dropped the spoon into the bowl, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and wiping that on his trousers. Turning to the bed, he took a precious fifteen minutes to tiredly make the sheets, spending another ten to get himself to look somewhat presentable before walking out the room, tray in hand.There was no Snape in the parlor. As the man hated Harry washing the dishes, thinking he'd waste the precious water they had, Harry left the bowl and spoon on the counter and stuffed the tray beside the corner of the counter.The clock rang behind him, making him jump and narrow his eyes. It stopped at nine. Harry raised his brows, turning to the door in surprise. Snape had left Harry asleep this long. Then again, after last night…Harry sighed. What had they even argued about? Harry couldn't even remember what had stemmed the angry outbursts. Was it seeing Oliver? Getting tired of Snape meddling with his life? Harry bit down on his lip, nodding furiously at the thought. That had to be it. Snape was meddling into his life, and Harry had enough of it, and was going to go down stairs and- But... it wasn't meddling. He stopped short of touching the door knob, pulling his hand back.Harry recalled all the good things Snape had done, since the day he arrived while pacing around the room, dropping his face into his face. The only times he remembered being angry at Snape were at the comments he made, or when Snape didn't even flick him on the ear were he to answer back.And, with that, Harry felt a complete idiot for thinking he could barge down the stairs and stand in front of Snape, wearing the clothes he had bought him, stomach full from the food he had made him after sleeping in the room he had given him.No, Harry rubbed his arm, taking a deep breath and opening the door. He wouldn't say anything. In fact, he wouldn't apologise at all and wait until Snape said anything and act according to how the conversation went.Even if it took them the whole day to get there.Mind made up, he threw open the door, chin raised and feet firmly on the step. He wouldn't shrink away. He wouldn't. Harry would open his door, go down the stairs and greet Snape as he normally did before getting back to work and-He barely reached the door before he pulled his hand back, feeling his cheeks burn as he slid down the wall.A sigh left his lips, long and tired, leaving his body to slouch against the wall. Extending his legs, Harry leaned his head back on the wall, closing his eyes. This wouldn't work. Harry just couldn't see how he could make up for what happened last night, or the days before, without making a mistake and not letting Snape get the upper hand during the conversation either.So he stayed there some ten minutes, paddling in a river of his own thoughts for a solution. None came. So when the bell chimed, of course Harry jumped to his feet, finding the customers an appealing alternative to speaking with Snape.But that, too, made his shoulders drop in defeat."M-may I help you?" he asked shakily, the hand he placed on the counter to balance him tapping on the wood."Oh, who are you young sir?" said the man with balding red hair and blue eyes behind a pair of glasses, wearing an excited smile, "An assistant of the Professor's?""Uh, yes, I am, actually," he said, stopping his hand. Harry eyed the man, and then the child he had brought with him that looked his age, with his father's tall, thin and gangling frame. The boy also had freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose, which he pitched occasionally with a mild expression of pain, "Would you like me to get him for you, sir?""We just came to pick up an order," the man said, a hand over the boy's shoulder, who was looking rather hopeful, "If you know where that is-" Harry shook his head. The boy's eyes dropped, his hands folded over his chest, "-Well, in that case, please tell Professor Snape Mr Weasley came to collect an order."Harry nodded, looking at the boy one last time before stepping towards the door. Hand on the handle, he bit down on his lips, nervously shuffling his feet.Mr Weasley's voice pressed forward, "Is everything alright, young man?"Harry turned his head sharply towards Mr Weasly, and gave a quick shake of his head. No, what could be so wrong as to stop him from opening the door, walk down the spiralling staircase and tell Snape he had a customer? Nothing. Unless one was Harry, or any entity that had gotten into an argument with him. Blinking, he pulled down the handle, the metal almost slipping past his sweaty fingers and stepped into the room.He thought about calling him from the first step. The room wasn't very deep underground. He would certainly hear. But Harry feared that'd be rude, and rude was something he was planning to become.Unless he was provoked, of course.So Harry took the stairs one step at a time, under the occasional shadow cast from the light on the metal steps. And when he reached the bottom, expecting to find Snape busy bent over his work, he paused at the last step with parted lips.Snape was in the corner, sitting on a chair. His elbows were placed on his thighs, hands stippled in front of his face, balancing his head while his back arched forward.Harry took the last step, his hand still on the rails, cool to the touch. This, seeing Snape like that in the corner, felt like an intrusion to his privacy. Snape was a stern man, with a strict composure and even harsher decorum.Harry ran a hand numbly down his arm, eyes pinned on his shoes, "Sir?"Harry, of course, didn't see Snape's response, but he heard some small movement, and a low but clear voice crossing the room, "Yes, Mr Potter?""Uh," Harry lifted a hand to stroke his hair, eyes now travelling up the length of the cabinets, "There is… Mr Weasley. He said he's here for an order.""Mr Weasly?" he repeated, the chair sliding across the floor. Harry lifted his head to find Snape had stood up and was crossing the distance between them with lengthy steps.Harry took a step back, taking a sharp breath. That stopped Snape, right in front of the spot the saturated light of the day hit. His abrupt stop sent dust spiralling in the air. And the room was cast into a silence, left to the tuneless dance of the dust particles catching the light.Much like Harry's nerves, it was uneven. Rapid. A million things at once jolting his heart until time settled them, like the dust spreading a thin layer on the floor.At that, Harry took a breath, wiping his forehead and clearing his throat, "I-I'll go up first, shall I?"It wasn't a suggestion, and had all the implication to be an order, but Snape nodded along, waiting until Harry was halfway up before his footsteps joined Harry's, echoing evenly in the room.The Weaslys hadn't moved at all. Harry offered them a smile, which only the elder Weasly returned, and stepped around the corner to stand in front of the counter, away from the chimney and where he predicted Snape would stand."Mr Weasley," came the greeting, a long leg sliding through the crack in the door, long fingers pushing the door closed, "How delightful to see you back from your trip.Mr Weasly gave a heartfelt smile, moving forward to join Snape once he was close enough and taking his long fingers in his large hand, "Same for you, Professor Snape. Say, the shop looks a little empty compared to our last visit."Snape gave a stern smile, "Does it? Pity. I would have hoped it would look far more… lively with an additional inhabitant.""Ah, yes," Mr Weasley said, his eyes striding towards Harry, "Youth. They bring some excitement to life, wouldn't you agree?"For some reason, the boy snorted, failing miserably to hide it behind a cough. Harry smiled at the twitch on the corner of his lips, visible with even his horrible vision, though his smile was wiped clean when Snape continued to talk."Most excitement I've had in twelve years," Snape said dryly, joining his hands behind his back, "The dangers my students subject me to can't even compare.""A far more qualified chemist, I presume?"Snape tossed Harry a glance, seizing him from head to toe before turning to Mr Weasly, "Far more competent than young Mr Weasley's in-class performance. Which does remind me-" he then turned to the boy, hands still behind his back, arching forward, "-Your trip to Egypt does not exempt you from homework."The boy coloured as dark as his hair and gave a jerky nod, pushing his father's hand from his head when it came down to pat his hair, "Yes, Professor..."Harry didn't listen after that, as Mr Weasly was engaging Snape in all sorts of enthusiastic conversation, even ones Snape was clearly uninterested in, but was politely nodding along to. Harry took the opportunity to walk around the two once they started to talk about the boy's eldest brother who was an archeologist working in Egypt, and stood right next to him.The boy turned to face him, and Harry lifted a hand in greeting, "Hello.""Hello," the boy said awkwardly, shifting his eyes from Harry to the adults (who were now talking about the convict, Sirius Black) and back to Harry again. He then extended a hand, rubbing his neck shly with the other, "My name's Ron. How 'bout you?""Harry," he replied, taking Ron's hand with a smile.Ron, while shaking his hand, pulled Harry to the side, near the fireplace. He didn't notice Harry turning his back to the fireplace, or the way he squared his shoulders, and that was fine with Harry. Ron did, however, lean forward, a hand covering his mouth as he whispered into Harry's ear, "Are you really Snape's assistant?"Harry glanced above his shoulder, "You can say that, yeah.""Blimey, he must be less of a git than school, if you can put up with him. Do you work here all summer?""Only since a week before July," Harry admitted with a shrug, grinning when Ron took the maths to his fingers.Ron dropped his fingers, "So, sixteen days?"Harry grimaced, remembering the week spent at Diagon Alley, "Almost, yeah. Is today the eighth?""Seventh," Ron corrected, straightening his posture after looking behind Harry, "Do you go to Hogwarts?"Harry sighed, shaking his head, "No. I want to, though," he said tiredly, stuffing his hands into his pockets, "What's it like there?"Ron laughed, lightly patting his shoulder, "You need to be a lot more specific, mate."So first, Harry asked about the teachers, and what lessons they had there. Ron fell into a long speech about each subject and their teachers, at the end of which Harry only remembered Professor McGonogall who taught something called physics."I'm not good at any of them, though. But this year we'll have different electives, and I'm thinking about choosing art with Professor Trelawney, but Hermione's -she's my friend, at Hogwarts- choosing everything! Can you believe it?""She must be smart," Harry said, folding his arms, a pang of jealousy from hearing how Ron could study all these subjects.Ron nodded, fiddling with his coat pocket, "Too smart for her own good-" he pulled out a small brown paper bag from his pocket, taking out a small ball with a white coating and offering it to Harry, "-Here.""What is it?" Harry asked without taking it."Dates," Ron said, popping it into his mouth, chewing a few times before speaking, mouth still full, "Well, candy. My brother 'aught us the recep'. 'ry some."Harry took the second offered candy and gave it a smell, immediately wrinkling his nose, "Smells like cinnamon," he said, putting the candy back into the bag."Oh," Ron said, swallowing, "It does have cinnamon. How'd you smell it so well?"Harry shrugged, suddenly very interested to go up to his room, curl into a ball under the sheets and pretend he didn't exist, "Keen nose.""Are you done, son?" Mr Weasley called from behind them, holding a large cloth bag in his hands. Harry hadn't heard Snape bring up the order, and Ron mustn't have either, because he choked from his third candy, stuffing the bag clumsily into his pocket, "No, da," he then turned to Harry, a a flushed smile on his face, "I hope we meet again. It'd be great, having you at Hogwarts. Bye Harry."Harry waved him goodbye, nodding politely at Mr Weasley and watching them walk out the door, the bell ringing behind them. Harry waited with Snape until they disappeared down the street, mingling with the crowd.The two didn't speak. But when the silence grew unbearable, Harry spoke at the same time Snape opened his mouth."Professor-""Potter-"They shared a glance, and Harry gestured towards him, reluctant to speak first, "Y-You first, sir."Snape tapped the counter three times with his long fingers, before pushing away and walking around it. Harry followed close behind, the door open behind them as they went down the spiralling staircase.Back downstairs, Harry sat down on his chair as gestured, pinching his arm. The room echoed with the sound of a chair being pulled from the corner, which quickly ended as Snape instead lifted it. Harry wondered if Snape didn't like loud noises until the man dropped the chair in front of Harry and sat down."I wish to talk about last night," Snape said without giving Harry time to adjust himself, hands clasped on his lap."Me too, sir," Harry said, because he agreed. But mostly he didn't have anything else to say."You must understand that it cannot happen again."Harry bowed his head, squeezing his arm, "I do, sir.""And for that…" Snape's words lingered, silence dragging forth, "We both have a part to play."Harry lifted his head, "Sir?"Snape leaned back in his chair, looking very tired, "You cannot expect me to be the lone participant in this… truce.""I wasn't. I mean-" Harry twirled his fingers, "Is that all we're going to do?""Have you any other ideas?""I don't. But I don't want to leave last night…. Unresolved.""You find it unresolved?" Snape said in the tone that wanted clarification and often got on Harry's nerves, face void of emotion.Harry took a deep breath and held it there, releasing it loudly into his hands, "Yes, I do.""And so do I. What part of it have you found the most conflicting?"Harry too leaned back, fiddling with his hands, running last night's argument in his mind. After a few minutes, when Snape waited surprisingly patiently, he started."First I want to say… It was a mistake, telling Professor Patel," Harry squeezed the fabric of his trousers, "I thought you trusted her, so… I wasn't careful. Careful enough.""Yes, I have noticed. That is…" Snape narrowed his eyes, pulling his lips into a thin line. Harry thought he looked conflicted, a few hundred thoughts running inside his head. He did, however, pull out of his thoughts with a blank expression.Harry often felt Snape never showed how he really felt."Last night cannot happen again. We... both were at fault. You, with telling Professor Patel -let me finish, Mr Potter- who you are, with my exact instruction to not do so, followed by an argument which I did not, and currently do not, appreciate."Harry ran a hand deftly through his hair, fingers pulling his bangs over his scar."But I am willing to listen to your reasoning, just this once-" Harry's eyes widened "-Under the conditions that you speak coherently, and listen to me after you break down your argument. Understood?"A nod. Snape sighed, loosely gesturing for him to speak, "I will not interrupt you.""And will you-" Harry swallowed thickly, the ghost of a touch brushing his upper arm, "Nevermind. I just… I feel confused. Confused on how to act. Like I-I said yesterday. I don't know whether to act this way or that way, because you don't tell me what to do."Snape nodded curtly. Taking a deep breath, Harry avoided Snape's eye as he continued, "I feel like you're controlling me. Having a say in everything I say and do. And I realize that for some things, you're right in what you do. But I don't… I don't want to be a servant.""I haven't been treating you as such.""I know but what I mean is…" Harry sighed, running a hand down his face, "Please don't act like every mistake I make is killing you. I know- Some things I did, they weren't good. But stop acting as I'm going to put you in danger every second you leave me unsupervised."Snape dropped his hands, "It's not myself I'm concerned about," he whispered slowly, quiet enough that Harry almost missed it. But without a second pause, and allowing Harry to speak, Snape crossed his legs taking on a much relaxed poise."Regarding the way I act, I will make a conscious effort to give clear instructions, steering you in the right direction should I fınd you're wavering without extreme… commentary."The words, forced through a clenched jaw, left no convincing impression. Harry made it known by blinking rapidly, hands squeezing the edge of his chair. There came no acknowledgement."I am inclined towards authority and discipline, and find no issue in being as such. You are a liability I will not risk endangering. My actions, which you interpret as 'meddling' will not change until Headmaster Dumbledore arrives, bearing the news of your future."Harry blinked, "You're… A stranger is going to decide what's going to happen to me.""You'll be surprised at how involved the Headmaster is with your affairs, well-being or otherwise.""...Do you trust him, sir?"The pause was enough to get Harry doubting the answer. However, Snape replied with an air of sincerity readily apparent behind his intended ambiguity."More than I trust anyone.""That's not enough reason to get me to trust him.""No," Snape agreed, "I would not expect it to, either. But that is neither here, nor there. I have one more request.""Request?"Snape nodded, "You may regard it as a condition, if you're intending to treat the word any less than the rules I have set before you. You are to continue having weekly sessions with Professor Patel, until we agree for you to stop.""Who is 'we'?" Harry asked, voice very quiet and very cautious, like he was approaching a wounded animal."Headmaster Dumbledore, Professor Patel and myself."Harry crossed his arms, "But why?""Because-" Snape bit out, closing his eyes and releasing a deep breath "-Because I said so, and because time will let you know.""That is not at all relieving."Snape smirked, standing up and pulling the chair up by the back, "I wasn't intending for it to be. Back to work, Potter, and no interruptions."Sometimes it was very hard to forgive.But in this instance, Harry smiled, because the pair of them had at least made it easier to forget.Standing up as well, he walked towards the cabinets where his books and newspapers were. His back to Snape, he spoke, the words heavy on his tongue."I don't know if I have the right to say this, sir, but I am sorry. For the… unjustified words I spoke."He didn't see Snape, but heard the pause in the ruffling papers, "You're expanding your vocabulary. How comforting."Lifting his book and not knowing how to respond, Harry collected the rest of the materials in his arms, ready to go back to his chair.A hand extended in front of him, slowing his step.He didn't look up."My actions were regarding your... " Harry looked up at the right time to catch Snape glancing at his arm. Their eyes met, and Harry instinctively ran a hand down his upper arm, shifting his gaze."It won't happen again.""I know sir.""And I apologise for it."Harry fiddled with the side of the pages, stroking the finger he had cut on the edges, "Thank you, sir."Snape dropped his hand, clasping it with the other behind his back and said, "You may work on the table, if you wish," before turning around towards his work.The rest of the day was mostly silent.Next chapter: The Guests of Malfoy Manor

Thank you, absinthe, for your edits. :)The following week was remarkably uneventful to the point of boredom.Their daily routine hadn't changed. Wake up, do chores, eat breakfast, work for four hours and assist Snape in whatever he may need help with after an hour long lesson from the Professor. Only this time, their awkward conversations and forced greetings gradually fell into ignoring and even avoiding one another whenever possible. Harry didn't mind, though. He read, he wrote and learned that mathematics wasn't as easy as the first few topics, all while crossing the dates off the makeshift calendar drafted on the inner cover of the book, waiting for Dumble-bore's arrival.And with every cross, Harry found that not everything was well with Snape.Because If there was anything to complain about, it was Snape and the fact that he was driving Harry to a point of insanity.Again.Gone was the man whose presence he enjoyed in the garden and tolerated in the laboratory. Snape had steadily grown from teasing to giving monotone lectures (which only made Harry sleepy) to not even hearing him.The smirks shifted into scowls when he thought Harry wasn't looking, or sneering at the sight of him when he knew Harry was looking, to nothing at all. Silence. Not a word spoken between them since the day after their argument, only small, vague sounds holding no emotion.Harry tried to convince himself that he was making things up, that Snape was just as bad as he remembered. But even the Patels, who had visited with the arrival of the new stock to help, looked concerned. Snape had refused to tell them anything. Even when Professor Patel had asked him very, very quietly if there was anything he needed help with, to which Snape answered something Harry couldn't hear from the door he was hiding behind.And all of this, of course, both confused and worried Harry. Because it wasn't just Snape's mood and tolerance of Harry that was in decline - it was his physical state as well. There was the fatigue; the tired, bloodshot eyes underlined by dark bags; the refusal of a bath while urging Harry to be clean; the trouble of waking up in the morning, needing Harry to knock on his door a few times.Harry would have dared to say even his greasy hair was suffering, but of coure he never told it to his face, lest he murder Harry impulsively. This was yet another alarming change, being impulsive. And Harry was growing afraid.Afraid that, among many things that Snape was forgetting these days, he'd forget his promise.The early, early morning of the twelfth of August made everything worse.Another nightmare had woken Harry. Sweaty and trembling, Harry took gulps of air, trying to steady his hands and body enough to stand up and open the window. Once that was done, and Harry's skin was tingling with the cold blowing through the window, he closed it and turned to the door for a drink in the kitchen, arm stinging with the scratching of his nails.On his toes, he was just about to reach the pitcher when he smelled it - the burning, foggy smell of smoke. And not just any smoke.Tobacco.Harry's head immediately whirled to Snape's door. His heart drummed. His already dry throat burned.It didn't stop him from approaching Snape's door, still afraid, ears still ringing.His hand met with the wall beside the door, and creeping up, he pushed himself flat to its surface and stood very, very still.There was no doubt about it. Snape was smoking. Odd. Harry didn't remember Snape smoking throughout his visit, and found it peculiar for him to choose this hour to do so. He was ready to go back to the pitcher, dismissing the matter entirely, when he heard something.A sob.A sob, which didn't stop. A sob which grew. And a sob which finally shifted into crying, wheezing and ugly sniffing. Wails, whimpers. Harry slammed a hand over his mouth in both surprise and fear of Snape hearing him, whose laments were muffled behind something, perhaps a pillow.Harry felt like an intruder, a witness to his shed tears, an invader and violator of Snape's privacy, the only privacy he had with Harry around. And he did urge himself to move. To leave. Leave for the comfort of his room and forget the night had ever happened.He stayed, all the same, one hand on the door. And only when both the smell of tobacco and Professor Snape's crying had ceased did Harry go back to his room.That night, he didn't sleep much.He didn't dare.At the chime of the clock, Harry threw back the covers and dressed hurriedly. The room was tidied in a few short moments, with a cold, gentle breeze lifting the curtains. Harry shrugged on a jacket against the chill and made a short trip to the water closet ( after which he washed his hands with freezing water).Once the potatoes and onions, which were very close to being harvested, were watered along with the ones in the pot, Harry rolled up his sleeves and cuffs and started pulling along the soil for any weeds. There were hardly any left, however, seeing as he had been working in the garden for the past week and moved onto the next chore. He had already washed the panes, and the water closet didn't require anything more, either. Very soon, Harry was back inside with a pleased smile, his hands freezing once again from washing them in the cold.He was swift in his sweeping as well, and at the end of a few short hours, he had a small meal of potatoes laid out on the table.The clock showed the exact time the two shared breakfast.Stifling a yawn, Harry studied his work with a small, beaming smile. For once, glad for the hours spent in… her kitchen, Harry turned to the shut door of Professor Snape.Harry had expected the man to wake up during his cooking. He hadn't made much noise, but Professor Snape had sensitive hearing and vision to accompany his stealthy walk. Nonetheless, glad for the lack of disturbances, Harry walked towards the door, pressed a hand to it and took a deep breath, and knocked.No answer.Once, twice. Again,not even a sound. Growing worried, Harry cleared his throat and this time tried his voice."Professor Snape?" he called, knocking once again, "Sir, it's time to wake up, sir."Dead quiet."Professor Snape, please wake up, sir. It's past six o'clock."He was ready to open the door in fear for the silent man when he finally did hear something. A groan, the lazy ruffling of bedsheets, and finally the shuffling slap of naked, approaching feet. Harry held his breath as a lock was turned and Snape yanked the door open.He looked worse than Harry remembered.Dark shadows under his eyes, skin paler than snow, sallow coloured cheeks.Harry only barely stopped himself from gaping."What is it, Potter?" he spat, or tried to, anyway. His usually silky voice came out in a gruffy slur, and his narrow eyes followed Harry's fingers towards the clock."It's past six, sir. And I-I have breakfast ready.""It is my duty to make breakfast.""I know, sir. I woke up early, today, saw that you weren't up, and decided to make breakfast when you wouldn't answer my earlier calls."Professor Snape's eyes fell on the table, and then back at Harry. The lines around his eyes eased, and the robes hugging his tense body fell easily down his bony shoulders."I didn't answer you earlier summons?"Harry stared at the space between Professor Snape's eyes and shook his head, "No, sir. You did not."With a hum, Professor Snape slid past him. Grabbing a plate, he returned back to the door. Before closing it, however, he pointed a finger at Harry, "Continue on your schedule. No customers are to collect their orders until I come down. Leave the washing up to me."The door slammed in his face, rattling the walls, and Harry blinked.The breath he was holding came out as a mixture of nerves and relief. Collecting himself from where he had slipped down to the floor, he ate his breakfast quickly and immediately after made his way to the laboratory.Professor Snape joined him downstairs just as Harry turned the page to a new chapter in Alice in Wonderland.He didn't look much better. The black circles under his eyes weren't gone, and his thin frame looked skeletal under his loose clothing. Harry pulled his gaze away from the man when Professor Snape looked his way."No house visit today, sir?" Harry asked, still not lifting his head."No," And with a swift turn, Professor Snape was back to work - sleeves down, back bent.A slow rumble echoed above them. Though far in distance, it was still very worrying. Harry looked up for Snape's reaction from the other side of the table.He hadn't even looked up.There wasn't much light today. Only a grey filter passed above the sun, clouds thick in the sky. Harry shivered, wishing for the jacket he left upstairs. Twirling the pencil between his fingers, he considered whether asking permission was worth interrupting Professor Snape.The answer was a clear no, when Professor Snape started tipping a very thin jar over the scale, eyes narrowed in concentration. So Harry, without scraping the chair on the floor, So Harry, without scraping the chair on the floor, tip-toed around the table so as not to disturb Professor SnapeThere were no customers when Harry walked out into the shop, and only a few people on the street. Harry walked behind the counter, going upstairs to the parlor, only to see with concerned confusion that Professor Snape hadn't washed up after all.A look at the door behind him told him Professor Snape wasn't intending to finish the job, either. With a shrug, Harry noted where his jacket was stranded behind his chair and cleared the morning dishes, propping them in the shelves after a wash.Back downstairs, Professor Snape didn't acknowledge him. His hands smoothly moved from jar to tool to herb, bringing them together in fluid movements, all while ignoring Harry.Harry followed suit not long after, immersed in his books and slowly declining stock of chalk, but still was the only one to hear the chime of the bell from above the laboratory. Looking at Professor Snape and finding him too immersed in his chopping of herbs, Harry closed his book.Professor Snape didn't seem to notice the constant looks Harry was giving over his shoulder as he climbed the stairs towards the shop."Ah!" a man said as Harry appeared behind from the door, putting a hand into his very large bag, "And I was worried no one was in the shop.""Can I help you, sir?" Harry asked cautiously, eyeing the scruffy man's clothes, which were made to resemble a formal uniform. The man held up a finger, scratching his beard and rummaging through the bag again before pulling something out with an air of triumph.He walked up to Harry, placing the letter on the counter, "Here ya are, Mr Snape.""Oh, uh, I'm not-""No payment needed," the man said, holding up a hand and shouldering his bag, "You have a good day, lad. Or as good as today's gonna get."And with that, the bell rang behind the man as he left, leaving behind a white envelope on the counter with very fancy handwriting.Harry lifted the envelope, and with a final look at the darkening street, made his way downstairs.Professor Snape still didn't acknowledge him. So Harry dropped the letter on top of the piles of papers, throwing a final look at the envelope and reading part of the address, 'Malfoy Manor' before going past to sit on his chair.It was when Harry closed his book that Professor Snape stopped working of his own accord, and not because Harry ushered him upstairs to tend to the customers he wasn't able to. Harry stretched his arms above his head, his back arching on the chair, stifling a yawn. Snape looked up from the jar he had lidded, the glass scraping on the wood as it was dismissed to the side."Oh, sir," Harry stood, holding up a hand when Snape turned to walk towards the stairs, "You received a letter."Professor Snape halted on his tracks, a hand disappointedly slipping down the rails, "From whom?" he asked, quiet and firm, not turning around."I don't know. But it writes… Ma-Malfoy? Is that how you pronounce it?"Harry looked up from the letter when there came no response, and stepped back at the look on Professor Snape's face. How anyone already pale beyond health could lose their remaining colour, Harry didn't know, but the professor was proving it could be done. He clumsily tore into the letter, eyes skimming the lines furiously.Harry thought the man would faint, and prepared himself to catch him should it prove necessary. It wasn't. His thin fingers curled around the edge of the table, pulling the skin above his knuckles taut. Harry couldn't see Professor Snape's face behind his curtain of black hair, but he did notice the small tremors of his arms, and took that as the signal to fetch the Professor a glass of water.The rumbling of thunder followed him up the stairs, and the rain joined in, gently rolling down the glass panes when Harry returned downstairs.Thankfully, Professor Snape was sitting down, head on the back of the chair and eyes lost in the rain. Timidly, Harry placed the cup in front of Professor Snape, silently praying death didn't come to collect the soul of the Professor.It didn't. Professor Snape pushed himself up from his sprawled form, gripped the glass and downed it in a few gulps.Lightning flashed above; the rolling thunder a reminder of more rain to come.Harry rubbed his fingers together, looking up and through the panes to the grey sky, "Sir, are you alright?"Professor Snape gripped the glass tighter in his hand, "I will be alright," he said in a voice entirely unconvincing, webbed with lies that even Harry could see."Would you like some tea?"Professor Snape lifted tired eyes lined with signs of age and lack of sleep. Harry offered a smile, nudging the leg of the chair with his foot, "I won't burn down your kitchen.""It's not my-" Professor Snape shut his lips, taking uneven breaths, " Some tea would be… appreciated."Harry nodded, once again climbing up the metal stairs, this time with straining legs.It took him two trips to get the kettle and cups downstairs, so he was pleased to see that Professor Snape (who looked to have regained some colour) had placed the kettle over the fireplace to boil when he returned from the second trip.Soon enough, there were two cups of hot, steaming tea on the table. Harry cupped his using the sleeves of his shirt, arms and chin resting on the table while he blew into the cup and tipped it to take a sip."I've never had tea before," he said, watching the steam rise from the light coloured tea, a sweet aftertaste lingering on his tongue, "Well, I did once, but I don't think it counts."Professor Snape placed his own cup down, arms crossed over the table, more relaxed then Harry had seen in days. He didn't answer, which sat well with Harry, as he didn't feel up to explaining the exact circumstances to Professor Snape.But he still wanted to talk, for some reason he didn't understand - wanted to share, and see what Professor Snape had to say about the event.But he took another sip, and slumped lazily on the table, smiling into his arm at the sound of the rain, the heat settling on his skin, "What kind of tea is this?"Chamomile, I believe," Professor Snape said, turning the cup in his hands, "Mr Weasley brought it as a gift from Egypt.""Mr Weasley? When?""While you were engaged with the younger Mr Weasley," he said, tilting his cup back for a sip.Harry frowned, "I didn't notice.""I don't believe that's an issue," he said, standing up and walking over to the fireplace, pouring himself another. Harry struggled to keep his eyes open, the sound of pouring water mingled with those of rain and thunder, gently coaxing them closed. Stifling a yawn, he huddled his head closer in his arms, the heat behind him a warm blanket over his shoulders."Is the letter from Dumble-roar?" said Harry sleepily, stifling a yawn, "Is he… coming then?""Headmaster Dumbledore," said Professor Snape from somewhere above him with a fırm voice. Harry felt a presence around him, and then fingers prying the cup from his hands."Yeah…" Harry mumbled, his eyes finally closing, his world muffled behind the sleep that was calling for him, "Dumble-bore…"And then, there came silence.Harry was at Patel's house early the next day, his limbs still sore from having slept bent over the table.Harry scratched out the 13th number on the inside cover of his book, swinging his legs mindlessly as he worked through multiplication problems. Both Patel's were somewhere in the house, excusing their absence by saying they had to pack for a small trip, and that they would join him very soon.Harry didn't mind, and happily drank his milk and ate his cookies (not cinnamon), almost finishing the plate by the time he closed his book. Picking up a cookie, he stuffed the whole thing in his mouth, chewing as he walked out the kitchen and into the living room.After a long fifteen minutes, Professor Patel finally came back, rubbing her hands down her skirt, "I'm sorry, Harry. I said I had nothing to do, but I didn't know you'd be coming in the morning."Harry straightened up, "It's fine, Professor."She smiled, taking a seat and sighing tiredly before straightening up, "So, did anything happen this week?"Harry thought for a moment, then shook his head, "Nothing very… important.""Anything you'd like to share?"Harry then remembered the tea he drank with Professor Snape, and the memory he wanted to share at that moment. Taking a deep breath, Harry searched for any sign on Professor Patel's face that showed she didn't want to hear anything he had to say. He didn't see anything, only a small smile.Harry took another breath."We drank tea yesterday afternoon," he said shyly, looking down, the words raising the beat of his heart."Oh, very nice. What did you drink?""I don't remember the name, something starting with a 'k' sound. But it reminded me of something that happened. Can I-" he brushed his bangs down, "-Would you like to hear it?"She nodded, joining her hands on her lap, and Harry thought the smile on her lips was met with some relief, "Please."Harry nodded along with her, rubbing his hands together, "The first time I drank tea, I… I stole some from my aunt, after she and her friend drank some and I was taking it to the kitchen. I liked it."She nodded, "I myself don't like tea, but I have a similar memory, of trying a sip from my mother's cup," then, her eyes dropped to the ground, and her smile faltered before returning a little strained, a little forced, "I burnt my tongue.""Is that why you don't like it?""Turkish tea is very bitter, and I didn't give myself the opportunity to taste anything else. Very odd, considering my mother had ample flavors for me to drink from.""Oh," Harry said dryly, placing his hands down on the sofa and scratching the fabric, "I think you should try this one. It's very sweet."Her forced smile eased into something softer, brighter, and Harry could see some of her teeth through her parted lips, "I will ask Professor Snape for a sample."Silence.Unlike yesterday, there was no rain, but the sky was the murky grey Harry was accustomed to, and even enjoyed. Mud made it hard to walk, and rain would often have them sick, back when he was with Edwin. But now? Harry hoped (not prayed, because he couldn't see the stars, and he still believed it was the reason behind his unanswered prayer) that he would always have a warm house to watch the rain fall. And Harry couldn't help but let his gaze wander towards the window, eyes squinting to look past the blur of his vision. He did it again. The light, cold and dim, falling across his face."Harry, do you have trouble with your vision?"Harry left the window to look at Professor Patel, giving a shy nod in response, "Yes. When I look into far distances, everything gets blurry.""And up close?" she asked, looking up at the clock on the wall. Harry's response was a simple shrug."I don't think so.""Professor Snape said he would come back close to six…" Professor Patel mumbled to herself, rubbing her chin, her sentence left unfinished. Harry, though, had a small idea on where the sentence was going, and hoped he was right in what he was assuming when Professor Patel excused herself for a moment to speak with her brother.It took ten minutes, and when she came back, she was securing her scarf down with a pin, a small smile on her face, "Grab your coat."As her father used to buy glasses himself, in the recent years, Professor Patel knew of someone called an 'optician', which Harry had never heard of before, but learned that they sold glasses and spectacles. And that alone put a smile on his lips, one that not even the jacket buttoned up to his chin could hide. (It was cold, Professor Patel had argued, forcing him to button all of them while not wearing any coat herself.) Not even the ugly stares at the end of their almost hour-long walk would dampen his mood.They arrived outside a shop, one with a sign worn with time and with letters Harry couldn't read in the few seconds he had, but imagined one of them had to spell 'optician'.Then, they entered, Harry right behind Professor Patel, because he really didn't know what to expect from an 'optician'."Mr Fahr?" Professor Patel timidly called into the shop, a hand on Harry's shoulder steering him to the counter. Harry took that moment to look around the shop, which didn't resemble any other he had seen. There were no boxes like in Mr Ollivanders, no jars like at the apothecary, and no books lining the shelves - only a counter in a very small and very dust-free space, with a door beside it."You know, Professor," Harry said shyly, looking at the door as though a monster would spring out of it at any given minute, "I never said this on the road, but glasses must be expensive and I don't have-"Professor Patel squeezed his shoulder gently, yet firmly and opened her mouth to reply when the door opened.There came no monster. Instead, a tall, lean man with thick white hair and what looked to be a single round glass over his one eye walked into the room."Good afternoon," the man said in a gruff voice, unfamiliarly accented, his eyes falling on first Professor Patel, then Harry, "I wasn't expecting to see you so soon, Ms. But the eye runs in the family, I suppose.""Not yet, Mr Fahr," said Professor Patel, motioning Harry with her free hand, "I have brought you another customer.""Even younger, it seems," said Mr Fahr, unamused, adjusting the glass over his eye while he stared Harry down, making him look away, "Follow me."Mr Fahr led them both past the door he had entered, walkıing to a chair in the corner of the new room they had entered. Beside it, was a cabinet, brown in colour and angular in shape, holding rows of small circles, similar to the one Mr Fahr was wearing. The man gestured to the chair, and Professor Patel gave Harry a little nudge, retreating to a corner to watch.Mr Fahr worked without conversation. He asked what he could see and what he could not, how long he struggled with his vision, and finally pulled up a chart with letters and asked him to read after confirming he was literate.Harry didn't manage to read much, nothing, really, with the chart a blur of black shapes.That's when Mr Fahr moved to the 'lenses' on the cabinet. He tried many of them, sometimes worsening his vision, and sometimes making it better until it came to a particular lense on his right eye that made Harry gasp.The room lit up in colour and quality both."Ah," Mr Fahr said dryly, with a hint of pride, "Found him."He then closed Harry's right eye, repeating the process until the second gasp, which wasn't any softer than the previous. Mr Fahr took the lens away, scribbled some things down on his notebook and told Harry he could stand up. After measuring his head for frames, he sent them on their way, asking them to return in seven to ten days.It had happened so fast, Harry couldn't even comprehend when they had walked outside."Am I…" he said carefully, biting his lip, afraid that if he acknowledged it now, the spectacles wouldn't be his, "Was that all real?""You getting glasses? Of course," Professor Patel said, taking him by the shoulder once more, "I'm not cruel enough to lie to you about this.""But why? I mean, thank you, Professor. Thank you so much. But I just-" he felt his ears heat up, and flattened his hair down over them in case Professor Patel notices, "-I didn't make you feel…""Obligated?" Professor Patel suggested. Harry looked at her with a raised brow, and she continued, "Forced, you mean? No. If it makes you feel any better, it's the beginning of the Islamic holy months tomorrow, and we're encouraged to do good even more than usual during it.""How long is it?" Harry asked, instinctively holding the fabric on her arm when they had to cross a street, and tightening his hold when he noticed a woman glaring at them from under her hat."Three months," she answered on the other side and, until they reached the Patel household, Harry asked all sorts of questions on what these three months were, what they did and why.But when they reached the neighbourhood and walked up to the door, Professor Patel paused at the lock, and turned around, "Harry, will you do me a favour?""Oh, sure.""For now, don't say anything to Professor Snape, alright?""Why not?" Harry asked following her inside and down the hall (after taking off his shoes) and into the kitchen, where he greeted Mr Patel with a smile before he stopped in his step, smile falling, "Wait, will he get angry?""At you, no," she shook her head, rolling up her sleeves and reaching above the cabinets over the counter for plates, "At me? I'm afraid he might.""But you bought me glasses!" he exclaimed, almost dropping the plates Professor Patel had given him, "Everything was so bright when I put them on, even for a few seconds," he grinned, setting the plates down and coming back for the cutlery, "Thank you again, Professor Patel. You didn't have to do that.""Ahmed said he'd pay half the price, so I am not entirely to blame," Professor Patel said, running a hand down the side of Mr Ahmed's hair and face.Mr Patel dismissed her hand with a shake of his head, turning to face Harry instead with a grin, "It wasn't much, Harry, truly. Come now-" he pulled him gently by the arm to the counter, pointing at the pot, "-let me pass on my culinary knowledge to someone who can't poison me with it."That earned Mr Patel a sharp flick on the back of the head, which only caused him and Harry to erupt with laughter."What?""I don't know how else to explain it to you, Professor Snape," said Professor Patel, crossing her arms over her chest, a timid frown on her lips, "Tomorrow is Rajab- I mean, the start of the holy months. I can't turn down the invitation now, I've already declined far too many times."Professor Snape, who looked like he had already surrendered his soul, placed a hand on his forehead and pulled his hair back, looking between Harry and Professor Patel and back again."Can't you- Three months is hardly less time, Professor-""Tomorrow is the first day, Professor. We were invited for iftar- I mean, to break the fast and spend a few days," Professor Patel cut him off, perhaps a little sharply, and Harry looked at Professor Snape to see if that had gotten a reaction from him.It hadn't.For some reason, that made Harry very uneasy.Professor Patel's frown eased, and her hands dropped to grip the door, "I'm sorry, Professor Snape. Truly. But this is a very inconvenient time, and Harry cannot stay for a few days."Harry saw Professor Snape clench both hands into fists, before giving a small nod, "Have a good trip, Professor," he said very dryly, a hint of venom in his voice and turned around, storming down the street.Harry gave Professor Patel an apologetic smile and a small wave, rushing to catch up to Professor Snape.Harry thought he knew what to do when he caught Professor Snape in a foul mood, once they were back in the shop and the door was closed behind him loudly and sharply, rattling the glass.The lock snick-ed instantly, and Harry shrunk in on himself, watching Professor Snape pace the length of the room from the corner. Cheeks flushed, he spat words beyond Harry's comprehension.Ten minutes later, Professor Snape placed his hands on the counter, back hunched over the wood with small, unhidden tremors."Mr Potter.""Yes sir?" Harry asked, shoulders tense."You are not in possession of a bag, correct?"Harry swallowed thickly, "No, sir."Snape nodded, pushing away from the counter and joining his hands behind his back.Harry thought he was trying to keep calmHarry also thought he wasn't doing a good job."We will have to share then," Professor Snape said, and Harry blinked, taking some steps forward."I'm sorry sir?" Harry said, unsure, eyes narrowed as Professor Snape pulled open the door, rushing up the stairs, Harry finding it very hard to keep up with him, "Why would we need to share a bag?"Professor Snape didn't answer. Instead, he slammed his door shut right as Harry stepped closer, almost catching his fingers.He came out fifteen minutes later, the sudden opening of the door making Harry jump from his seat. He was about to ask Professor Snape what was going on, but couldn't stop him on his way to Harry's room, leaving him to helplessly watch Professor Snape open his bag of folded clothes and place them beside the clothes Harry had on the chair in the room."Put your clothes in here, Potter. Neatly," he said dismissively, walking past him in a whirl of cold air and headed towards the staircase, "I have more to pack."Harry didn't ask him what. Copying the methods Professor Snape had used, he packed the small amount of clothes he had into the bag, still confused as to why the Professor was insisting he pack now, as though they were going on a-Harry's hand froze on the shirt he was folding, the sleeve falling from his grip. He turned around, half-expecting the Professor to be standing in the door frame, a smirk on his face as he said, "Figured it out have you, Potter?"Professor Snape was going on a trip. To this Malfoy character, judging by the letter that arrived yesterday, and his plans of leaving Harry with Professor Patel were ruined because they were going on a little trip of their own. And even if Harry couldn't understand, as he closed the luggage bag with a thud, he knew that Professor Snape going pale for something like this wasn't to be taken lightly.He pulled the bag up, his back arching backwards under the weight. The parlor floor creaked threateningly as he dropped it to the floor, rubbing his back.Professor Snape arrived long after Harry was done, his head resting on the sofa, the room illuminated with candlelight. Without a word, Professor Snape slipped into the kitchen, wiping his hands on the towel hung by the chair. Harry could hear the cutting of bread, the chopping of vegetables, and something being stirred aggressively."The potatoes chose the best time to be ready," Professor Snape muttered darkly, walking past Harry towards the fireplace and hanging the pot, using the fire from the candle to set the logs alight."I'm not supposed to come, am I?" Harry asked into the darkness, playing with the loose threads of the sofa, "That's why you wanted to leave me with Professor Patel."Professor Snape scoffed, leaving the vegetables to cook and walking back to the kitchen where came the noises of a paper bag, water being poured and something being stirred before Professor Snape was back, holding a bowl in his hand along with a… brush."You have a brush?" Harry asked, sitting up straight."Among many things, apparently," Professor Snape answered, sitting very close to Harry, making him scoot back on the couch, "Lift up the hair over your scar.""Wait, what?"Professor Snape sighed, tilting the bowl to show him a dark, cream textured paste, "The colour is only temporary, but enough to help disguise the scar.""Why do I need to hide my scar?" Harry asked, a hand over his forehead, "I didn't need to do that before.""I've never had to look after a boy that fell through my chimney, either, but here we are.""Yes, well-" Harry's mind suddenly stuck on the chimney, and he had to turn to look at it, his eyes going wide, "Hang on. You said the flue was damaged!"Professor Snape lifted his fringe, far gentler than Harry expected, and warmer than he wanted, but the paste cool on his skin."You'll find the general population relies on routine lies," Professor Snape muttered, lifting the brush after a few strokes, "And mine was hardly any worse.""I still don't like it."Professor Snape smirked, placing the brush down inside the bowl, "I imagine you wouldn't."Before Harry could touch his forehead, Snape slapped his hand out of the way and used something to hold his hair back.Something which was a hair clip."That is not funny," Harry said in a low voice, running his fingers over the metal embroidery."You'll find I'm not joking, when I finish talking."And then he told him about Lucius Malfoy, how dangerous a man he was, and exactly why he shouldn't know Harry's real identity.Harry found it a lot more troubling falling asleep that night, even with a full stomach.Just a note, because I didn't know how else to allude it into the text: Rajab, Shaban and Ramadan are three Holy Months in which Muslims worship Allah more often than the rest of the year, specifically in Ramadan.There is a separate four months of the year, called the Haram Months, which include Rajab, and are also sacred, but for different reasons. I don't want to get in too much detail, but here is an extract of a passage:"But such was the honor and reverence of the Sacred House in Makkah, that all the Arab tribes unanimously accepted and regarded the three months of the Hajj, namely Dhul-Qaadah, Dhul-Hijjah, and Muharram and the month of Rajab dedicated for Umrah (a type of worship) as absolutely sacred wherein any type of war or aggression was absolutely prohibited and treated as a sacrilege."Again, sorry for any possible confusion. ^^'

I feel very to have had absinthe beta read this chapter. Thank you, absinthe. :)Apologies for the laet publishing date. The bean I use for a brain remembered to finish it on Wednesday :,). I hope Sundays work for yıu guys too.Enjoy!Harry had greatly underestimated what Professor Snape meant by early.Because sometime during the night, Harry was coaxed out of his sleep by a voice hissing his name close to his ear. He didn't acknowledge it, not at first, because this was one of those nights he hadn't been woken from a nightmare and he had every intention to enjoy it until morning.But Professor Snape had other plans."Potter," he snapped, tugging at Harry's sheets, "If you do not wake up this instant I-""You'll leave me here?" slurred Harry into his pillow, turning to face the other direction and hugging himself, because his blanket was very clearly gone, "Please do… Professor…"And that's how Harry found himself on the floor, water dripping down his face and the floorboard digging painfully into his side. All of this had happened in the few seconds he closed his eyes, with the offender standing over his gasping, a bowl in his hands."And they say children have trouble waking up in the morning," he drawled, ducking out of the way when Harry grabbed his pillow and launched it at his face, "I'm giving you only fifteen minutes to get ready and fix your bed."It was a painful ten minutes of getting ready, with clumsy flailing about in the dark for his socks and shoes. In the end, he carelessly slipped them on, leaning his head on the back on the bed frame.Too early, Harry decided, head fuzzy from the lack of sleep, mind seemingly dipping under warm waters. Too early.And not even Professor Snape, who found him half-slumped on the bed, would make him any less tired.Shivering from the second round of water, Harry dragged himself outside, wrapping his coat around his body.The harsh wind carried him past the wet soil, sending dust into his eyes and jabbing at the wet parts of his skin and hair.Harry had never found washing his hands such a painful job and hoped that he wouldn't have to do it again at the end of his trip to the loo.Professor Snape was already in the shop, dressed, with a lantern in his hand. Of course he was.Harry soon stood outside the shop with their shared bag in his hands, shivering from the cold.No moon, only the unsettling roll of thunder."Don't tell me we're going to walk," Harry demanded, the sleep slowly being pushed out of him.Professor Snape pulled the door shut, fumbling with the coat pocket for the keys. When he couldn't find them, he placed the lantern in his hands on the floor, the light casting a shadow past his legs.Harry heard the click of the lock."I'm in mind to make you walk," said Profesor Snape, with no sleep in his voice. From his right pocket, he took out a pocket watch Harry had never seen him use before and after a quick glance, put it right back, mumbling quietly to himself, "He should be here any minute."Harry didn't ask who 'he' was. Instead, he put the bag down beside the trunk Professor Snape had dragged out of the shop, and leaning on the shop window, Harry closed his eyes.The gradually approaching sound of a carriage made him open them at once."Who sends a carriage this early?" Harry groaned, kicking away from the shop and turning to where the sound was coming from."It's only past five," Professor Snape muttered, an emphasis on the only that Harry almost missed. But too sleepy to extinguish whether it was sarcasm or just Professor Snape being Professor Snape, Harry didn't bother with a response.The street, without the light of morning, was an endless dark corridor between the two lines of buildings. With no crowd, and only a single carriage echoing above the stone road, Harry felt a shiver run down his spine at the unnerving sight.The carriage came closer, a small lantern in the distance accompanied by the sharp wind. A near perfectly-timed flash of lightning spiderwebbed across the sky, illuminating a glimpse of sharp silhouettes.The carriage arrived when the thunder did."Mr Snape," said a gruff voice, half his face lit from the lantern hung near him."Professor," Harry heard Professor Snape correct with a sharp tongue behind him, followed by footsteps, "I have a trunk."The man jumped from the carriage, making a loud thud when he landed on the stone. Harry, who had no desire to anger a man a few sizes bigger than Professor Snape, stepped towards the carriage doors. In the dark, he heard the trunk being lifted and then dropped to the wood, jolting the carriage, and buckles fastening softly. Harry wouldn't have given it much thought, if the man had used some help from Professor Snape or at least made some noise when lifting the carriage. He didn't, and Harry slipped inside the now open doors with an impressed look on his face.Really not someone he wanted to trouble, then.Professor Snape climbed in afterwards, the door pushed closed after him, and the carriage gave a jolt as the driver took a seat."Alrigh'?" he asked, and without waiting for a reply, brought the reins down, earning a pained grunt from the horse.Harry, who had never ridden in a roofed carriage with actual seats, stood in the middle of the seat as much as possible, even if that meant sitting right next to Professor Snape."I suggest you sleep," Professor Snape said, extinguishing the lantern and putting it down with the rest of the luggage , "It's a long journey to Wiltshire.""How long?" Harry asked, pulling his knees unsurely to his chest and leaning on the corner of the seat, "Will we be there tomorrow night?"Professor Snape scoffed, somewhere in the dark, "One day, in the future, I hope."That was the last thing Harry heard before the shaking of the carriage lulled him to sleep.They hadn't arrived when Harry woke up later that morning, or that afternoon, and Professor Snape said that they wouldn't be arriving until the next day.That wouldn't have bothered Harry if he wasn't still required to get some work done in a carriage in a state of constant jolts and tremors, which was enough to distract him from work and bring him close to throwing up his breakfast of potatoes.That was enough for Professor Snape to excuse him from his books, but not from teaching Harry a few important things, like how his name was Ali Patel, a distant relative of Professor Patel's who had become Professor Snape's apprentice for the time being.Harry thought this lie was utter rubbish.Professor Snape asked him for any better ideas, and smirked at the look on Harry's face. He taught him many great things about his newly fabricated parentage, such as the reason he could only speak English, and where his parents were, both of which were partially similar to his current status.By sunset, when the sky had gone from grey to dark and threateningly windy, Harry had memorized all the lies he needed to tell, the words repeating themselves in his head when they entered the small town they were to stay in, both to rest and pass the worst of the rain.As luck would have it, of course he and Professor Snape had to share a room to cut costs."It's no Leaky Cauldron," Professor Snape said, pushing forwards with his back to Harry, key dangling from his fingers before their room.He didn't finish the sentence, he didn't need to either. Harry wouldn't respond either way, now more than ever, with Professor Snape at least putting some effort into communicating with him.Entering the room after him, Harry placed the lit lantern on the table beside the bed, almost grabbing it again when the table tilted forwards light momentarily silhouetted Harry's hands. Walking past him, Professor Snape dropped the luggage bag on the bed, stiffening when the bed let out a shrill sound.Then he continued, as though he was unbothered by the sound.Harry walked around the bed to the other side, stepping around the noisier floorboards, and frowning at the walls outlining the only window in the room. Two cracks, one on each side, crept from the ceiling and right beside the glass. Harry leaned forward, squinting at the darkness beyond the window.His hand touched the cracks, and Harry wasn't surprised when he felt a cold breeze blowing through the damp material."I hope the blankets are warm," Harry muttered, his words lost in the rain hammering on the window. With a final glance, he walked back to the bed, standing opposite of Professor Snape."Put this under your head," Professor Snape said without looking at him, throwing a towel like cloth at him, "I do not want to deal with lice."Harry didn't catch the cloth, which he only partially saw in the light and had to feel around the bed to find it. Straightening it out, Harry turned the pillow over with the least amount of contact, spreading the sheet over it. Professor Snape did the same after closing the bag and placing it beside the table.Then there was silence.Harry sat uncomfortably down on the bed, running a hand down his scar, or where his scar was. Harry hadn't had the chance to look into the mirror yet, but from the nod Professor Snape had given in the morning after parting his hair, he had to assume it wasn't visible.Professor Snape sighed, and Harry felt the bed dip on the other side."From tomorrow, until we go back, you are to listen to what I say word for word. I do not want you talking unless I give you permission to.""I don't think I need anymore scaring, Professor," Harry said tiredly, pulling his shoes and dropping them to the floor, "I'm pretty sure I'll be seeing Mr Malfoy in my dreams soon."Harry saw Professor Snape watching him in his peripheral, but he didn't return the gesture. Instead, he pulled the covers over him, still wearing his coat. The scratchy fabric brushed uncomfortably against his cheek, yet not hard enough to keep him from the sleep weighing him down.And with the blanket tucked under his chin, a shield against the draft, he said very quietly."Good night, sir."Harry heard Professor Snape sigh once more. The covers behind him peeled back, dipping further down, before there was hardly any sound at all.It still took Harry a while to fall asleep, fighting his own thoughts.A man Harry didn't recognize entered the shop, taller and bigger than any man he had ever seen. Harry had to arch his back to look at the man, and even then he couldn't make out the face that was hidden in the darkness of the ceiling. "May I help you?" he looked up from the jars on the counter. The tall man didn't respond at first. Harry didn't push him, taking a small step backwards in caution. But the man heard the sound, and suddenly Harry felt the warmth inside his chest being sucked from him like the lights in the shop, leaving him cold, afraid. Alone. Where was Snape?Harry threw himself to the ground when he felt a presence beside him, covering his head with both hands, his chest contracting uncomfortably. The presence suddenly returned, snaking around him, and Harry fought back a scream, stuffing a fist inside his mouth."Is this the boy?" said a foreign, hissing voice right beside his ear, the coiling feeling around him now wrapping around his throat, "Is this the boy?""Yes!" Uncle Vernon screamed behind the cupboard Harry suddenly found himself, head throbbing and unable to breath with the hold on his throat, "That's the boy! Filthy, arrogant, stupid! Always said his lot was savage, and needed to be taught to be civil! The boy is the pinnacle of proof!"Harry felt the tears silently fall down his burning cheeks, stinging the cut open bruise under his eye, and yet he made no sound. Mr Malfoy's hold - he knew it was Mr Malfoy, He just knew, wrapped tighter, and Harry felt his body going limp, barely able to mutter a single phrase against his screaming uncle, "No…"Filthy, arrogant, stupid. His Uncle's favorite choice of words. But now it was his aunt screaming them, adding a few of her favorite ones. "Arrogant! Selfish! Ignorant! You mistake of a boy!"The pain only got worse, when her voice was replaced with a familiar one. A softer one. A kinder one.One he never wanted to hear screaming at him. "Did you really think I would buy you glasses after you stole your Aunt's tea?" Professor Patel said, and Harry scratched at his arms because scratching the hand around his throat did no good."P...prof-"Then came an insane laugh, one Harry only heard from Professor Patel, filtering through his cupboard. The fear knotted in his stomach increased ten-fold, the pain coursing through his body like blood burning mercilessly under his skin. Harry shook his head, feeling the pressure on his throat cut into his skin, though not enough to kill him.Barely enough to keep him alive. Harry heard the smashing of glass, Professor Patel's insane laugh, and the shouts of his relatives while fists banged against the door. Harry felt hot. So very, very hot. He was dying, no longer struggling, the force that kept his arms up wilting like autumn leaves.The last straw was Aunt Petunia's perfume, going down his throat as he felt the world fall.Professor Snape's hand pulled him out of the darkness and into the shop. "Professor?" Harry said with a shaky smile, watching the emotionless man, "Thank you, Professor."Professor Snape's arms came up, and Harry felt a sense of hope that he was bringing them up for a hug. Harry smiled, accepting the firmness on his shoulders. And then he pushed, watching Harry with a vile smirk as he fell down the tunnel and into the open mouth of Mr Malfoy. Harry's eyes snapped open, but he did not move. Only after a few painful slashes down his arm did he realise he was shaking.There was no weight on the other side of the bed.He took a few gulping breaths, rolling his shirt and coat over his arm under the covers. Professor Snape wasn't here. Mr Malfoy-Harry stopped himself before he could think anything else, turning to face the other side.Professor Snape was there, alright, right beside him, smelling of tobacco and blending in with the dark.Harry immediately shrunk back."Sn- Sir," he said, wincing when his voice shook unsettlingly, raspy and heavy with emotion, "You scared me.""You were having a nightmare.""You were smoking," he bit back without much thought, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand, furrowing his brows when they came back wet, "We all need secrets to get us through the night.""Not much of a secret, when a person other than yourself knows," Professor Snape said, stepping back and stuffing something into his coat pocket. The venom of his voice was replaced with tired snide, not entirely angry but not void of offence either, "Would I be correct to assume…""Mr Malfoy?" Harry joined his hands under the covers, sniffing and feeling very embarrassed about it, "'Course, though not only him.""Ah."Harry wondered if Professor Snape knew what Harry meant, or if he was feigning. Either way, he pulled down the folded sleeves of clothes, shrugging the shirt off his sweaty skin. Professor Snape moved back as he did so. Harry watched him, the coat folded over his arm, curling his hands into fists to stop the shaking. A few minutes later, when his shaking had stopped and Professor Snape lit the lamp, Harry placed his coat at the foot of the bed, ready to go back to sleep.He stopped when Professor Snape started walking towards the door."Where are you going?" he dropped the covers, looking out the window. The rain had lessened. But it had yet to stop."I won't be gone long," he dismissively answered, unlocking the door and sliding the key from the slot, "Stay here."Harry scoffed as the door closed, rolling to his side harshly. As if he could go anywhere.The door closed, and Harry kept his eyes open until Professor Snape's feet disappeared down the hallway.Harry turned to the other side, still huddled around him. Behind him, the rain continued to fall in a comforting pace, no thunder, no lighting. Just water hitting the window. Harry wished he could be back in the shop, with this rain, warm beside the fireplace, holding a cup of something warm to drink.He sighed, closing his eyes and curling in on himself. To miss a place that wasn't his to call home…That reminded him of when Professor Snape warned him to not call the apothecary home. Harry thought that was rot, because he'd been staying there for well over twenty days, and had more freedom than he ever had at-He flung off the sheet, clumsily walking towards the window after putting on his shoes and planting both hands on the windowsill. Taking heavy, audible breaths he leaned forward, pressing his warm forehead against the cool of the glass.It wasn't instant relief, but Harry felt his anger gradually fall to a manageable level.Each time the glass warmed, he would move to a different spot, squeezing his eyes at the initial touch, but melting into the texture.And that's exactly how Professor Snape found him, hunched over the window sill with his forehead pressed against the pane.Harry pretended the fresh tobacco scent on Professor Snape's clothes didn't burn his throat."We're leaving, Patel," he said, sharp footsteps drawing Harry from position, "Jean agrees the rain will worsen, come morning.""You talked with him this late at night?" Harry asked, wondering how that meeting went, "He doesn't look like a... easy to approach man.""It might not look like it," Professor Snape said, stuffing a few things messily into the bag, "But it's already past five."Harry stopped mid-stride, thinking of the last time he caught Professor Snape in the act of smoking. The sun hadn't risen yet, but the first part of the night had gone by.Pulled from his thoughts by the sound of the luggage bag closing, he caught the coat hurled towards him at the last second, glaring at the man as he pulled it on, making a mental note to ask Professor Patel a few questions about Snape.That is, if he refused to answer. Harry had every reason to believe he would.Taking the lantern when it was handed to him, Harry followed Professor Snape out the door, getting a small glance into the room just as the door closed. Stifling a yawn, Harry shuffled after the Professor, taking small steps when he noticed he was the only one making a sound as they walked. That was another thing he wanted to ask Snape - Just how he managed to move without a sound, and appear when he least expected him to be there.The corridor opened into the main hall, and Snape dropped the key on the counter. The inn looked far less eerie than when they arrived, with only one source of light and no creepy innkeeper to frighten Harry with his one eye.Harry felt a hand slowly go around and land on his shoulder, gently urging him forward."Don't fall behind," Snape said without looking at him.Harry felt the spot where Snape was touching, well, he would compare the feeling to uncomfortable heat, the one that spread through your body and bore down on you until you took off a layer of clothing.But he didn't shrug the hand off, clamping down his protests by digging his nails into his palm.In the end, the rain did worsen, but not until two o' clock. Thankfully, clusters of buildings -good buildings, not run-down like some of the villages they passed through- started showing up just as it began to pour harder. Harry huddled back into the seat, still feeling shaken from the nightmare. He was refusing to think about it, burying his head into his arms when he felt a memory or thought resurface.It helped him to not remember, to keep the emotions behind a wall of his own construction. One thing it was bad at doing, though, was filtering the emotions he did feel, so that Harry increasingly felt nothing at all.Harry curled his fingers around his arm, well-aware of a pair of eyes on him. This flatness he felt... he was almost sure it was a build-up of the past week, where he had to do his best to keep himself as emotionless as possible, for both his and the Professor's sake.His arms suffered for it.But Harry liked how they left almost no trace - some discoloration, yes, but the trace that anything had touched his arm would disappear in a few minutes, sometimes more if he had taken special effort.I just didn't have enough time to do it, Harry thought, sneaking a glance over his arms to Snape. I'll feel better after I do it. Malfoy Manor should be big with plenty of places where Snape (or anyone) wouldn't catch him.Plenty of space to hide secrets.They arrived at five thirty, if Harry had seen correctly on Snape's pocket watch. He couldn't do the calculation in his head, so while the driver -wet to the bone and looking very miserable- got their bags, Harry counted on his fingers.The trip had taken almost 29 hours, if he calculated right.Snape tapped his shoulder to get his attention, and nodded to the door, "Don't fall, if you decide to run."Harry scooted towards the door, wincing at the rain. He put an arm in front of his eyes, and jumped, the rain obscuring the precious little he could see.Following the black blur in the distance, Harry took careful steps after he almost slipped on a rock, flailing his arms to just barely keep his balance.The rest of the trip was infuriatingly similar, with Harry leaning dangerously to one side, faltering in the wind until finally, it stopped.Snape was already under the awning, his curtain of hair sticking to his face and loose clothing hanging off him like heavy drapes.Harry would have laughed, if he too wasn't looking like an haphazard shape."If anything got wet..." Snape said flatly, eyes on the trunk and luggage bags. He didn't finish the rest of his words, because the large doors opened, revealing a very thin man dressed in a formal uniform."Mr Snape," he greeted, stepping aside and gesturing towards the house with a gloved hand, "Welcome.""Professor," Snape corrected bitterly, picking up his luggage, "Come along, Patel."Harry followed after, shrinking as the man's eyes followed him, his nose wrinkling . The driver, who was standing behind them, brought in the trunk and placed it beside the thin man.Harry didn't know whether to thank him or not, so he gave him a small wave, not waiting for his response and rushed to stand next to Snape. While they waited, Harry took a look around, shivering as he did so.They were standing in a large entrance hall with a corridor that led directly to a door. They hadn't seen much of the grounds, what with the rain and Harry's poor vision, but it couldn't be less grand than the inside. The manor, sumptuously decorated with magnificent carpet, held ornate and gilded furnishings.But oddly, he expressed no reaction.A few minutes of waiting, under close watch of the thin man, another well-dressed man, much younger than the one behind them, came forward with a towel, handing it to Snape."Another towel, sir?" he asked, looking at Snape.Snape said, "Yes," at the exact moment the thin man said, "No."All three of them turned to the thin man. Snape had paused drying his hair, and was watching the thin man with a calculating look."Is my apprentice to use my towel?" he asked mildly, voice skimming the point of anger.The man's eyes narrowed, "You didn't hear it from me, Professor."Harry blinked, looking between the two men who seemed to be having a staring competition. Harry conceded that Snape won, because he pushed the towel to Harry and instructed him to dry himself.The younger man with the upturned nose faced the thin man, "Another towel, then, Mr White?"White, after some cautious thinking, waved a dismissive hand.Harry still didn't understand what the exchange had been about, but he dried himself with the white towel, taking off his coat -the wettest of all his clothes- and draping the soft material around his shoulders.The younger man, who introduced himself as William Hall after his return, took the sodden coats from them and asked to be followed, leading them to the staircase.Harry made sure to take as small of steps as possible to not wet the floor, still feeling the hard glare from White on his back.At the end of the staircase, they turned right to a corridor lined with doors on each side with portraits. Harry found it amusing that each and every man in the portraits had blonde hair and a very similar, pointy look.Hall stopped in front of two doors separated by a portrait of a bulky man who wore a funny looking hat over his blonde hair. Opening both of them, he motioned for them to enter."Master Malfoy is waiting for you in the drawing room," he told Snape, giving a small bow before walking back the way they had come.Snape told Harry to follow him into the door on the right of the portrait, which was plainly decorated. The pallet was a mixture of green and grey, with a queen-sized bed and a bedside drawer. In the corner farthest from the bed was a small wardrobe, and pushed close to the window was an armchair and table.Harry walked around the carpet and towards Snape, who was looking through the bag he had placed on the bed. He handed Harry a pair of trousers, a shirt, and a pair of socks that weren't his."I don't want to wear your socks," Harry said, grimacing.Snape put it above the shirt and trousers with a raised brow, "My feet don't smell, Potter, nor are the socks dirty."Harry was intending to say he highly doubted that before closing his mouth, accepting the socks with a muttered thank you, still not intending to wear them.Until Snape called after him right as he walked out the door."I'm not healing your feet if they get infected, Patel."Entering his own room, which was very similar to Snape's but decorated with warmer colors, Harry closed the door. Quickly getting changed, he dried his wet feet and slid on Snape's pair of socks. Only problem? His shoes were wet too, and he had no way to dry those. So that was another trip to Snape's door, barefoot because he didn't want to dirty the socks. Snape, without a second thought, went back into the room and produced a pair of-"Slippers," he said, planting them into his hand and disappearing behind the door before Harry could ask where he had gotten them.Harry sighed, turning the 'slippers' in his hands. They resembled shoes in the sense that you wore them on your feet, but looked like they had been woven with grey wool above a thin layer of leather. Harry wouldn't have minded if they didn't look like they were meant for children or women.Regardless, he went back to his room, pulling up his cuffs and slipping on the socks before moving to put on the slippers. They were an almost perfect fit, which only proved they were meant for children younger than Harry.Harry got off the bed, picking up his wet clothes and hanging them above the chair. After a final glance through the window, he left the room.Professor Snape was outside, observing the portrait with a bored look on his face."Fascinating," he said without heart.Harry didn't think so, as the portrait looked rather dull, but what he really found interesting was how, without his coat or cloak Snape looked so unnatural. He had the impression that Snape often hid behind his layers, and seeing him with only grey trousers and a black shirt felt absolutely wrong.From outside, came the very sudden and loud sound of thunder.Harry jumped while Snape flinched, squaring his shoulders. The two shared a passing glance, straightening at the same time while averting their gazes. With a cough from Snape, that was their cue to go. All the way down the corridor and staircase, and along the length of the corridor that led to the door Harry had seen earlier.Hall was there, waiting for them and he straightened when he saw them approaching, turning to knock on the door.Harry hid behind Snape, suddenly feeling very scared and refusing to lift his face. That must have been fine with Snape, because he turned around, placed a hand on the back of his head and put a fınger over his lips.Harry took a sharp breath through his teeth.The door opened smoothly, pouring the light from the hallway into the room. Snape removed the hand, going first into what Harry guessed to be a drawing room. Uncle-He closed his eyes, squeezing his hands together.He wouldn't think about it. Not now.Opening his eyes, he was met with two people, both seated on a long sofa and dressed too well. A boy and an adult.The adult, who had to be Mr Malfoy, had a pale, pointed face, with pale blond hair and cold grey eyes. Harry didn't miss the snake-headed walking cane in his hand. The boy had to be his son, with white-blond hair and a pale, pointed face, very similar to the men in the portraits.Harry immediately knew he didn't like either of them."Ah, Severus," Mr Malfoy said, standing up from the sofa, "Good to finally-""Uncle Sev," cut the boy from behind his father, walking around his father and approaching Snape. Harry watched with wide eyes as the boy opened his arms, and flung it around Snape in a hug, his mouth dropping open when Snape's arms actually came around the boy in a nervous embrace"Yes, hello to you too, Draco," he muttered, patting his head nervously, glaring when Harry unsuccessfully masked his chuckle with a cough, "Pleased to finally arrive, Lucius."Mr Malfoy, who was looking less than pleased, took his narrow gaze and moved it to Harry, "And who is this, Severus?"As planned, Harry didn't speak, letting Snape fabricate the stories while he watched his slippers, trying to ignore the way both Malfoy's were staring at him. Finally, when Snape was done, Harry released a deep breath, lifting his eyes.Mr Malfoy was still watching him."Well," he said, putting up his chin and facing his son, "Draco, entertain our guest while Severus and I talk.""Yes, father," Draco said, moving from Snape's side and walking towards the door, "Come along, Patel."Harry's head whirled around, face scrunching up in worry. But Snape merely shook his head, gesturing the door with his eyes in a way that said, "Go, but remember what we talked about."Harry complied, going after Draco, still feeling uncomfortable even after he left the room.The door closed behind them, hiding the two adults from view.

His mother's hand, stroking his temple."The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamt I held you in my arms. When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken... and I hung my head and cried."His mother's voice, gently crooning."You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are grey, you'll never know, dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away...""Can you sing it all, Mommy?" he asked, mostly wanting to put off going to sleep."That's the important part, the rest doesn't matter," she said, her fingers brushing against his cheek. "Goodnight, baby. No arguing, now.""Okay..." he sighed, pulling his stuffed dog up to his neck. "Night night, Mommy."She bent in and kissed his forehead, then his cheek, the same spots her fingers had been. Then she made sure he was tucked in tight before leaving the room, keeping the door slightly ajar. There was a softly glowing orb hovering above the rocking chair in the corner of his room, giving off a purple light for him to sleep to. There was also the light of the full moon coming in from the window.Four-year-old Remus Lupin yawned loudly and rolled over, settling in for sleep, still hearing his mother singing to him in his head. He was almost asleep when he heard raised voices from downstairs. They were really loud, upsetting him. He shifted around in his bed then wriggled out from under the blanket, walking over to the door and crouching down."...orts of him being nearby, that doesn't scare you?" his mother said, rather loud, very frightened.Remus stuck his fingers in his mouth, feeling afraid at hearing his mother so afraid."We'll be fine," his father snapped back, causing Remus to flinch at how angry he sounded. "It's not like it understands anything this time of the month anyway.""You said he's different, what if he wants revenge for—""It, not he!" Remus stepped back at the tone in his father's voice, sucking on his fingers even harder. "If it wanted revenge, it could have done so last month." He heard a soft noise behind him and turned around, staring around the room but not seeing anything. "We'll be fine." He turned back to the door, wanting to hear more about what his parents were fighting about. "Besides, what can it do? If it tries to attack the house, I'll kill it.""Lyall..."Another sound. Remus turned and felt even more afraid. He thought he'd feel better with his blankie so he began going back to his bed when a cool breeze stopped him. His window hadn't been open before. He tugged his blankie off his bed and went over to the window, climbing up onto the seat and looking out at the bright moonlight filtering through the trees. His eyes traveled downward then his small body stiffened when he saw something on the ground, in the yard. There was a big shape moving back and forth, and it frightened him.He scrambled down off the windowseat to go tell his mama but when he turned there was a man in his room, standing so close that all Remus could really see were legs. He craned his neck back. Up, up, up, into the pale face of a stranger whose sharp teeth gleamed as he grinned. His arms darted out, blurring. Remus opened his mouth to scream but a cold hand was pressed hard against his mouth. He began thrashing in the arms of the stranger as the stranger picked him easily up off the floor with one hand, the other still holding back Remus's screams. The stranger's body and arms felt different, harder, colder. Almost like a statue than a person.MAMA! PAPA! Remus struggled as the stranger jumped onto the windowsill then jumped down. They were on the second floor and Remus thought they were going to hit the ground and splatter like the plum he once threw out his window. But the stranger landed in a crouch, still holding Remus who felt nothing more than a jolt."Got'm," the stranger hissed out, straightening up.Remus wet himself as a huge monster stepped out of the shadow of a tree.It was a wolf. A huge, hulking wolf with bared fangs, raised hackles, the moonlight showing every inch of its muscled body. It was so big, the fur ragged, the tail swishing back and forth. Almost wagging. Remus suddenly didn't care a stranger was holding him, he twisted around, trying to climb up onto the stranger but the stranger held him stiffly. He couldn't move except to kick his dangling legs, his pajamas damp with urine. He kicked the stranger hard in the belly though it seemed to have no effect."Want me to drop'm?" the stranger asked.The wolf padded out to the middle of the yard The stranger followed, carrying Remus who began kicking harder, tears streaming down his face. Where was Mama and Papa? Why weren't they doing something?The giant monster paused, looking right into Remus's eyes. He tried to scream again but the stranger kept his voice muffled.The wolf looked up at the house then at the stranger, nodding. The stranger laughed as he threw Remus down onto the ground. He began sobbing loudly as pain filled his small body, having never experienced anything like this before. The wolf stepped closer. It was so big, its eyes were glowing, saliva dripping down as the lips curled back to show the long fangs. It growled, stinky hot breath washing across Remus's face as he sucked in some air then screamed as loudly as he could, his tiny voice filling the air. He was hurting too much to move though tried as the wolf was on top of him now. One paw came down on his leg, holding him even more still as he thrashed about, trying to get away. The weight against his thigh hurt so bad."Remus?! REMUS?!""DAAADDDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" Remus shrieked. He was vaguely aware of his father appearing at his bedroom window.The wolf moved its mouth in a strange manner that almost looked like it was grinning in glee, teeth an inch from Remus's face now,"That's right, Lupin! Watch!" the stranger laughed.Then even worse pain filled Remus's body. His scream tore through the air as those long fangs sank into his arm. His body jerked, head smacking against the ground, back arching as the wolf tugged at his arm. His arm burned as everything started going grey and dim. The wolf lifted its head, picking Remus clear off the ground."NOOOO!" Lyall screamed, seeing his son dangling out of the wolf's mouth. He blasted a spell which the stranger deflected, then Lyall jumped out the window, using a spell to soften his landing. Hope was at the window, screaming, sobbing. Then she disappeared.The wolf shook its head, and let go, Remus flying out, hitting the ground, a haze of pain blinding him. He lay on the ground, the world spinning around him, trying to figure out what was happening. The wolf bent its head in and Remus thought it would eat him but instead it gave the bleeding bite mark on his arm a great big slobbering lick, blood and drool splattering across his body. Remus gave out hoarse, shaky sobs. He didn't understand. He didn't understand why this was happening. The pain. The wolf. His child mind tried to find an answer but it just slipped away.The stranger was laughing and then a bright light filled the yard as Lyall shot a spell once he landed."Enjoy your soulless son now, Lupin! Does he deserve death too?" There was a loud cracking sound, and the stranger Disapparated while the wolf took off towards the forest. Lyall ran after it, shooting spells, screaming obscenities.Remus just stared at the sky, sobbing at the pain he was in, wondering why his parents hadn't stopped it yet. Then arms went around him. He tried to scream, thinking it was the stranger again, but it was his father.He was crying, tears landing on Remus's face as he was carried inside. "Shit, shit, shit, shit." Remus wanted to tell his daddy to stop because mommy didn't like those sorts of words but all that came out when he opened his mouth was a wail.Remus faded in and out as he was set on the dining room table. Lyall was sobbing, just clutching at him. His mother was crying, the sound of jars clinking as she brought healing potions in."Won't work, it won't work.""He's bleeding to death! We have to do something waiting for the Ministry to come!""Ministry?! We can't call the Ministry! Hope, he's been BITTEN! They'll just KILL HIM!""Then I'll take care of it!""It bit him, it bit him!""Lyall, move!""He's going to become one of them..."Cold goo slathered onto the bite. Remus began crying again as the world sharpened into focus then faded again."Shh, baby, it's okay," his mother whispered."He's gonna turn. He's gonna become one...""You're scaring him."Bandages pressed down to try and stop the bleeding."Hope, you don't understand! HE WAS BIT!""I KNOW HE WAS BIT I CAN SEE HE WAS BIT NOW SHUT UP, LYALL!"Remus began bawling as she screamed. She began hushing him again, then singing in a shaky voice to try and keep him calm as she worked."You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are grey..."His mother's hand, stroking his temple."You'll never know, dear, how much I love you..."Her voice broke as she sobbed the last few words, fingers sliding in her son's blood as his eyes fluttered shut."...please don't take my sunshine away..."

Author's Note: trigger warnings for the whole story include gore and body horror (I go into detail for some of his transformations), child abuse, general angst and whump. If you need any other kind of warnings just let me know I'll be glad to let you know. Also I finally figured out how to have the proper em dashes show! Yay! Also the world of Shifting Lines will eventually include Wolfstar, and will have a lot of LGBT+ rep once everyone starts getting older (though the wizarding society in this is generally against that sort of thing, so I guess warning for that; it won't be the sort of story where everyone is out openly. But of course all of this is way down the line, Remus doesn't even realize his sexuality at this point haha)./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Make some scratches on my floor Crawled out on my hands and kneesIn old movies people scream Choking on their fists when they see shadows like thisBut not one screams cuz it's just meLocked up in myselfNever gonna get free— In Memory of Satan by The Mountain Goats/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus woke up with a loud gasp in the wee hours of July seventh, then began panting for air. He had been having a nightmare though couldn't quite remember what. He remembered blood and teeth, fangs scraping against bone in a clicking sort of manner, though even awake the clicking continued. His eyes darted towards the window, shrinking back a little bit for a second until he realized it was just an owl.Merlin, he thought as he slid out of bed, legs so shaky he nearly fell over. He went to his window, cautiously opening it because the owl waiting for him hated him. Sure enough as soon as the window went up the owl gave an angry hissing sound, flinging the letter in, pooping on the windowsill, then flying off.He shut the window, picking the envelope up off the floor. Beautiful calligraphy-esque writing on the front stated his name. Remus J. Lupin with floral doodles around the edges. Remus shook his head, snorting a little at how over the top Sirius had to be. He put the envelope under his mattress then left his bedroom, listening careful to make sure he hadn't awoken his mother. He squatted at the top of the stairs for a few minutes then, once assured she was still sound asleep, went to the bathroom to splash his face with some cold water. He could practically taste the blood in his mouth.Oh, he thought as he spit some pink water out. He must have bitten his tongue or something in his sleep.He splashed his face again then returned to bed, pulling the envelope back out. Near the end of his first year he had told himself he'd cut off contact over the summer, to cut them out in their second year. It was the safest thing to do to keep his secret. But... he couldn't help but write to them. His friends. He decided that he'd just cut them out in the future. Not quite yet. That would be all right, at least so he hoped...His finger traced along his name before he opened it up, pulling the letter out.Dear Remus, 5/7/72now that its happened i can officially tell you the Big News. My cousin Andromeda is no longer a Black. by that I mean not only is her surname no longer Black but as of five-ten pm today she has been blasted off the family tree. I dont know if youll remember the one time you met her but that Hufflepuff that met us too? Edward Tonks? They got married. I've known this for a while but didnt want to tell anyone until it became public in case the family somehow found out. In case you dont remember, Tonks is a Muggleborn. So my family isnt happy.Merlin i cant believe it. Andy's married. To a Muggleborn. I mean i dont care hes a Muggleborn its just super weird to me? i cant wrap my head around it, especially since her older sister is a bloody insane Blood Purity All The Way witch. ugh i dont think ive ever mentioned my cousin Bellatrix but she should probably be locked away in Azkaban. She is CERTIFIABLY INSANE! Anyway so Andy elopes, see, and leaves a letter for her parents. They came over today since my father is the Head of the Family, you know, Patriarch and all that, so they had to tell him, and i have not heard so much SHOUTING and YELLING and SCREAMING in ages. And crying. Uncle Cygnus and Aunt Druella were both screaming and Mother was shouting and cursing and Father was all quiet because when he is angry he goes quiet and Bellatrix was there too threatening her own sister. The rest of us hid out in my room. Us being the 'young ones'. My brother (Regulus) and cousin Narcissa (Andy's little sister, have I ever mentioned her to you? She's one of the ones that got hit by the Bat-Bogey Prank, haha). Cissy was crying. she loved Andy, and i think that might scare her cause what if the family gets mad at her thinking she knew something? but Andy never told Cissy a single thing. the only person she ever told was me. maybe she was worried Cissy would rat her out. honestly i dont know if she would have or not. Cissy is the sort of Obedient Daughter type so even though she loved Andy she might have. Who knows.Mother gathered everyone in the Tapestry room so she could show us what it means to Betray The Family and Marry Filth (her words, not mine, I swear). Off went Andy's name and I wanted to throw up. Is that weak of me to say? i just cant believe it. I mean I am happy for her. i am. she married for love which is not something many purebloods seem to get to do, let alone my family.I just hope Andy is happy. She must really love this Tonks guy so I'm guessing she is happy. I mean if she wanted to just escape the family she could have easily married a pureblood that doesn't hold with the whole Blood Purity ideal and run away that way, and it wouldnt be this bad. So obviously its love.Anyway. The first week of the hols is almost up and i am MORE than ready for school to start again. i miss James so much. i miss Pete. and i miss you too. I really hope you're doing well. i cant help but worry about you sometimes. which probably sounds dumb but i dont care. please write back soon?SiriusRemus read the letter multiple times before folding it up into as small a square as he could. Once that was taken care of he got out of bed, pushing his mattress up to find a tiny little nearly invisible bump. He proceeded to get a knife out of his bedside table's drawer, cut a slit into the mattress, pushed the letter in to sit alongside the five other letters he had gotten since school let out, then he got out his wand to use a quick mending spell. The hole disappeared, leaving the vague sort of ridge. He put his mattress back down, patting the top carefully.Maybe he was being being a little paranoid, but he just didn't want his mother to find the letters./\/\/\/\/\"Morning, baby." His mother kissed his cheek as he came into the kitchen. "Sleep well?""Yes," he lied, sliding into a chair.Hope beamed as she piled food onto his plate. "No nightmares?""No." He picked up his fork, feeling quite nervous as he always did when he lied to his parents. Lying to his parents was something somewhat new to him, and he expected to be caught anytime he did. "Did you sleep all right?""Mostly." She smoothed his hair down then began filling up Lyall's plate as he came into the room. They exchanged a rather passionate kiss (Remus tried not to gag) then Lyall sat down across from Remus. They told each other good morning then Lyall disappeared behind The Daily Prophet. Remus wondered if Andromeda Black's marriage was mentioned somewhere in there.He really didn't know a whole lot about the Black family, truth be told. A lot of what he knew he had found out from that letter. Things he did know before the letter included the fact a member of the Black family attacked and blinded a wonderful witch then was killed by said witch's werewolf sister, who was immediately executed by demand of the Black family. He thought the Blacks were mostly crazy and Very Dark, judging from some of the things people said about them (Sirius included). He also knew Sirius hated his family and didn't like being home for the holidays. And finally he knew they had let Sirius have a broken arm for two weeks without healing it.All right, so that last one he wasn't so certain of. Less of a fact, more of a possibility. During the Christmas holidays of their first year Sirius's handwriting had been absolutely horrid then when they returned he had a broken arm—his dominant arm. It just seemed like too much of a coincidence for Remus, however he had zero evidence."You all right?" Hope ruffled his hair.Remus snapped out of his thoughts, realizing he was probably just blankly staring at the wall. "Yeah, just thinking about things." He began poking his eggs, stomach twisting a bit as he added, "Thinking about school."Hope sharply drew in her breath while Lyall glanced over his paper. "More sausages?" Hope asked, quickly getting to her feet. Lyall raised the paper again.They had somehow managed to avoid discussing school for the nearly two weeks since he got back. Remus had expected it to come up right off the bat, however Hope had said nothing. So Remus said nothing. Lyall said nothing. They were all saying nothing, waiting for the other to bring it up and now Remus had but his mother just acted like he hadn't.He sighed, scooping up some eggs and shoving them into his mouth. They needed to talk about it something this month. He wasn't sure when the Hogwarts letter would arrive, probably near the end of the month? Or did older students get their letters at a different point? Either way the sooner they could have the argument the sooner they could get it out of the way.While he ate he looked at the front of the newspaper, figuring he'd read it after his dad left. The headline was about some Ministry scandal then there were other smaller articles. A new broom coming out, someone who received an Order of Merlin, some ex-Wizengamot member who passed away, so—"Oh!" Remus dropped his fork."What's wrong dear?" Hope asked."Erm, c-can I see the paper for a moment?"Lyall frowned but handed the paper over. Remus carefully folded it over to read the article. Henry James Potter, 113, passed away Thursday 6th of July, 1972. Henry is most notable as having served on the Wizengamot from 1913 to 1921... Remus scanned down the article talking about Henry Potter's success then landed on what he had been looking for. Henry is survived by his sister, Caroline Potter (104), two sons, Fleamont Potter (68), Charlus Potter (66), and two grandsons, Boreas Potter (31), James Potter (12).Remus pushed the paper back over to his father. Of course Lyall wanted to know why Remus had been looking at that particular article, so Remus explained James Potter was one of his dormmates back at school."Just a dormmate, right?" Hope asked nervously.Remus pretended to look confused. "What else would he be?" Besides one of my best friends. He'd have to write a letter to James with his condolences. James had been saying his grandfather was very ill... or dying... or something like that, so it hadn't been completely unexpected; still. He hoped Arthur would get back from Lily's soon so he could write to James. And Sirius, he needed to write back to Sirius. Shame Filibuster was such a bratty owl and wouldn't let anyone besides Sirius touch him (in Peter's letter he had complained that Filibuster had bitten him and drew blood).Finally Lyall put the paper down, took one last slurp of coffee, then kissed Hope goodbye before heading off to work. Remus finished off his breakfast then took all the dishes to the sink to start cleaning. When he was about halfway done he saw an owl making its way to the house. Arthur! He peeled the rubber gloves off then hurried to another window, throwing it open. Arthur landed on the table, hooting in a tired manner."You okay?" Remus stroked him gently. "You poor thing..." He took the envelope off of Arthur's leg then carried him over to the perch in the living room. He refilled the water and food dish then just watched with worry until Arthur slowly fell asleep. Maybe he would wait to write to James. Arthur didn't seem in any shape for another trip.He heard his mother in the kitchen and took off, running in as fast as he could, snatching the envelope from the table before she could see. She turned just as he shoved it up the inside of his t-shirt. "Sorry, Arthur came back," he said, going back to the sink. "I'll finish the dishes now.""You don't need to—""I don't mind," he promised. Except sometimes he splashed himself while doing dishes (most the time) and he didn't want the letter getting wet. Hope was leaning against the counter, sipping tea, looking at one of the hanging plants. "Erm. I need to go to the bathroom first." He hurried off, transferring the letter from inside his shirt to his pocket, having to fold it up.When he returned to the kitchen, Hope had a strange look on her face. "Where did Arthur go?" she asked."In the living room," he said, stepping back up onto the stool, pulling the gloves back on."No. I mean, when he left the other night."Remus ducked his head, scrubbing hard at the plate. "I don't know. I speak wolf, not owl.""REMUS!" Hope shrieked, causing him to drop the plate. "Don't you ever say something like that again!""S-sorry, Mum," he whispered, hands shaking a little now. "It w—was j-j-just a joke.""No, it wasn't," she said sternly. "Jokes are supposed to be funny. That was not funny." He thought it had been funny. "You're not a wolf. You're a werewolf and that is different. You're not an animal. Remus. Look at me. Say that, all right?"He sighed, brushing his fringe back. "I'm not a wolf," he repeated obediently. She raised her eyebrows. "I—I'm not an animal?"That was the right thing. Her face relaxed into a smile and she kissed the top of his head. "You're not. No matter what everyone says."Everyone says I'm an animal?, he wanted to ask, keeping it to himself since he knew that would set her off again. "I'm sorry.""We need to get your hair cut. It's getting far too long.""I like it long, Mum." It wasn't even that long either. Just past his ears. He liked it long so he could hide behind it when he needed to.She raked her fingers gently through his hair. "We'll get it cut soon. Before the beach trip, all right?""Okay."Now he smiled, thinking about the trip she had been talking about for ages. She had saved up some of their tiny income so the two could take a day trip to the beach sometime in the summer, and now it was summer. He was very excited about that. They had been to the beach once before when he was a toddler but he could barely remember that. Pretty much most things pre-werewolf he couldn't remember well. Some post-werewolf stuff wasn't too sharp either. A lot of the early months were pretty blurry, except for a couple memories he had re-seen over the past year, such as his first transformation.He shuddered now as he resumed scrubbing, wishing he could banish those memories into the abyss of the forgotten. They had been, until he started taking Occlumency lessons and they surfaced. He now knew what he had looked like-four years old, covered in gashed, broken bones, sobbing in the dark cellar because he hadn't understood, all he knew was his parents locked him up—a toddler—in the darkness for his body to be tortured.A few tears plonked down into the soap water.He sucked in some air then plowed through the rest of the dishes, emptying and cleaning the sinks, then hurrying up to his room so he could read Lily's letter. He climbed up into his window seat, the window open to let in the warm summer breeze. As long as he didn't look down he was all right.Dear Remus, 4/7/72Well it's only the start of the summer holidays and already I'm grounded. I might have let my temper get the better of me. I hope yours is going better than mine. Of course you don't have a sibling who seems to hate you no matter how hard you try. Oh, I tried so much talking to her as soon as I got home! I overheard her talking on the phone with her friends about this boy so I tried talking to her about him and she shouted at me to never eavesdrop again. It was an accident that I did. Then the other day I asked her to go have some ice cream with me, my treat, and she just gave me this look and told me she'd rather be run over by a car than be seen with me. Then last night she started complaining that she couldn't bring her friends around. Mum and Dad and I all said of course she could but Pet just stuck her nose in the air and said it was too risky with me around. It's not like we've got magical stuff stuck up everywhere! I have some stuff in my room but her friends wouldn't come into my room. Then today she started complaining about Bessie making all kinds of racket (Bessie was NOT!) and I lost my temper. I know we're not supposed to use magic out of school... I couldn't resist. I was so angry. She was taking a drink of tea and I turned her cup into a mouse right in her hands. She started screaming so loudly, Mum and Dad are furious with me. I'm grounded for a while now. Which is awful since I was supposed to be meeting up with Severus tomorrow.Of course knowing you, you're probably laughing at what I did.All right maybe I was laughing too. I feel so bad for doing that but I hadn't done anything to her and I am simply SICK of her treating me like this! I should try harder though.Anyway, I really hope you're doing well. You looked so peaky on the train ride home. How is your mother doing? I miss you so much already! I miss school. I miss being able to do magic all the time. All the classes. Reading the books are not the same thing. SIGH! It's going to be a long summer.Love,LilyRemus read the letter multiple times then repeated the process to hide it as he did with Sirius's letter in the night. Now he owed three letters. Arthur was not strong enough to go anytime soon, so they'd have to wait. Probably before he sent them off Peter would write again. At least Peter's owl liked Remus, somewhat. Most animals disliked him because they sensed the wolf inside of him (he didn't care what his mother insisted, he knew perfectly well he was an animal). James and Lily's owls both mistrusted him. Peter's owl did too, but Cocoa was, ironically, the bravest out of all his friends' owls when it came to him. Ironic, since Peter was probably the most cowardly out of all his friends. He wasn't really a coward, really, just the most He definitely had his brave streaks. Occasionally. Sometimes. Though he was certainly the sweetest out of the group; they often called him the Nice One (or Blithe, if they were using the dumb B nicknames Sirius had given them).Thinking about Peter made Remus push up his mattress again, cutting into another section and pulling out a photograph album. He sat down on the floor, rifling through the pages until he got to the last picture. James, Sirius, Peter, and Remus were sitting on the front steps of Hogwarts, arms around each other, big smiles on their faces. It had been taken about two weeks ago, though felt like an eternity.Remus touched the edge of the picture which had been developed the Muggle way so it wouldn't ever change no matter no. Nobody would leave the picture, nothing would happen. That was one thing he liked about Muggle photographs: they really were a snapshot of that second in time, preserving the instant forever.Footsteps coming up the stairs.Remus shoved the album back into his mattress, performed a quick mending spell, then hopped on top of his bed just as his mother opened the door. He smiled at her, trying to breathe normally and not seem out of breath, not wanting to get her suspicions up.He hated lying like this. Sneaking behind her back. But... if she knew he had friends... it would make getting back to Hogwarts a lot more difficult than it was going to be. She absolutely didn't want him having friends and knew if she even suspected he'd be forbidden from going back to school.

Remus stared in absolute horror at his reflection. That day he and his mother had gone into a nearby Muggle village for some grocery shopping, and they had stopped by a little hair salon first to set up an appointment. The employees had an opening right away so he had gotten his hair cut. The probably had a slot open because they were terrible hair cutters."M-Mum!" he hissed as they left the shop. "This looks terrible!""What? No, it looks sweet," Hope said, patting his head. "You look like Christopher Robin. You like those books."His eyes went huge. It was worse than he could ever imagine. "Mum! Christopher Robin is five! I'm twelve! Twelve! Twelve year olds don't have this haircut! Unless they're girls!""I'm not appreciating your attitude right now."He pressed down on his head, flattening the hair, very glad nobody would see him for a couple months. "This better grow out. I'm going to ask Dad if he can use a spell to fix it."Hope sighed. "Stop fussing, you look fine.""No, I don't! If I go back to school with this haircut I'll be a laughingstock! It makes me look even younger than I already do!" He could easily see his old nickname of 'Baby' coming back with a vengeance. He also easily saw the other Marauders busting up at the sight. "You shouldn't have paid them.""Remus, stop!" Hope snapped. "You're certainly acting more like you're six and not twelve right now. Besides, you're not going back to Hogwarts." With that she pulled him into the grocery store.Oh. Of course. Now she brought it up when he couldn't argue about it since they were in a public Muggle location. He folded his arms, hunching his shoulders, brooding miserably as they wandered through the store. If she thought he'd forget about it when they left she had another think coming. Even with bribes which he could tell she was doing when she put some steaks in the cart then a tub of double chocolate fudge ice cream.Once back in the car he took in a breath to begin his argument but Hope just slumped forward, pressing her forehead against the wheel. "M... Mum?""I'm fine," she whispered, turning the key. "It's just been a long day."He sat back, not sure whether to bring it up or not. "Are you okay?""Yes. I'm sorry, sweetheart, it's just really difficult seeing you growing up." She twisted in her seat to look at him. "One minute you're my little baby and now you're nearly a teenager. It doesn't help that I've hardly even seen you this past year. I don't want you to become a stranger." She reached over, stroking his stupid hair. "I know you don't like the hair but snapping at me earlier really hurt, darling. A lot of how you've been acting since you came home has been hurting. You've been holed up in your room more than you used to. Sometimes you look so angry. You're so lovely when you smile but you were scowling the entire time in the store. I suppose I'm just... not ready for teenager hormones. Mood swings. Growing pains." She turned back the right way round in her seat and pulled out of the parking spot. "It's just really hard," she murmured. "Please know I'm here for you, though. I know it's not easy talking to your mother but... I'm here for you. Anything you need. I love you.""I love you too," he said earnestly. Honestly. "I do, Mum. I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap. I just... really don't like this haircut. But it will grow out before I go back to Hogwarts."Her fingers tightened on the wheel, her knuckles going white. "Remus, I don't think now is a good time to discuss this."He glanced forward at the road then flopped back. "Yeah. Um. I am sorry, though. For upsetting you."She reached over to give his hand a squeeze before turning the radio on. Remus watched out the window in silence the rest of the trip, heart pounding as he went over his argument for returning to Hogwarts. He didn't want to pull out the Big Argument so early in the summer however he might have to.He reached up, touching the small bump under his shirt. His fake silver necklace he had gotten to throw suspicion off of him being a werewolf. His Occlumency teacher, Miss Fawley, had sent it to him. She had also been the one to give him the idea to possibly convince his mother to allow him to go back to school, which was to inform his mother that there was every possibility that he might come up with a cure for lycanthropy—with plenty of education of course. He knew this would pretty much guarantee him going back to school... but he didn't want to use it unless he really really needed to. He just—didn't really get why she was so against him going to Hogwarts. No. He did understand. It wasn't safe. Which was true, really; home was the safest place for him to be to keep his secret. But it wasn't exactly unsafe. He had kept his secret for a year. He could continue the charade.He pulled the chain out, twisting it around his fingers, aware of his mother's glance. The first time she had seen the necklace she had literally screamed until he explained why he had gotten it (plus the fact it wasn't at all silver, just looked it, and if it was silver he couldn't have it on at all as far as he knew).After a short, tense drive back at Lupin's little cottage, Remus pushed his necklace back into his shirt and helped his mother carry in the groceries. He took care of the pantry items while his mother filled the fridge."Um, mum?" he asked, kneeling on the floor as he rearranged some cans. "About Hogwarts...""Would you like chicken tonight?""Mum—""Or fish?""Mum!"Hope turned to look at him. "Remus, what did I say earlier about your attitude?""I—I'm n-not giving attitude...""Yes you are."He ducked his head then winced when no hair fell across his face. Curses, he thought miserably, going back to the cans. "Why did you say I'm not going back?" he asked quietly. She didn't respond. He cleared his throat, raising his voice a little. "Mum, why did you say—""I heard you," she said, head inside the fridge. "I just think it was a failed experiment.""It... w—wasn't an experiment, though. Going to school isn't—isn't an experiment." He found a can way in the back. It was old, so they needed to have it soon. He set it up on a higher shelf then returned to organizing everything, new stuff in back. "Was school just an experiment for you?""Oh, that is entirely different, darling. You're different." Hope shut the fridge then came over, kneeling down next to him. He looked up into her sad eyes as she placed her hand against his cheek. "I want what's best for you."He swallowed heavily. "I love school. I love learning. It's only for—for a few more years anyway. Nobody ever suspected a thing. It's safe. Professor—Professor Dumbledore made sure of that." He took her hand off his face, holding it in both of his. "I love school. Please. Mum. Please." It definitely wasn't the eloquent argument he constructed in his head during the car ride. Worst of all, his nose began itching as he felt tears welling up. Just what he needed.Hope bent in, kissing his forehead. "We'll talk about it later," she said, then got up. Remus watched her go back to putting food away then angrily finished in the pantry. He heard her words from the car as he stormed up to his room—about him holing himself away—however he just wanted to be alone./\/\/\/\/\"What the bloody hell?!" Lyall stared at Remus when he came down for dinner, eyes locked on the stupid haircut. "What did you do to him?""He got his hair cut today. He looks sweet." Hope smoothed down Remus's locks, sounding rather stiff."He looks like a girl.""He does not!""He looks nine.""Lyall...!""He looks like a nine year old girl! Why does our twelve year old boy look like a nine year old girl?" Lyall pointed his wand at Remus however just as he shot out a spell, Hope knocked his hand away so the spell hit the ceiling."You're not going to waste the money spent on that haircut by growing his hair out!""You paid money for him to look like a nine year old girl?""People usually pay for haircuts, yes," Hope retorted, folding her arms, lifting her chin stubbornly. "Besides, he's very delicate. He's going to look—er—young no matter what."Remus looked down, fiddling with the hem of his shirt. Great, even his own mother thought he looked bloody nine. He thought he at least looked eleven.Lyall heaved a sigh, rubbing his forehead. "Remus, can you stand that haircut for the summer? It'll grow out by the time you go back to school then you can just get your hair fixed there.""Yes!" Remus burst out without hesitation. If it meant going back to school he could one hundred percent deal with looking like a nine year old girl all summer. "It will be fine. No one will really be seeing me anyway, except you two."Hope pursed her lips together, eyebrows going down. Before she could say anything, Lyall waved his hand. "Then it's all settled. Let's have supper, I am hungry."Is that really it? Remus wondered as he helped his mother serve the food. Dad said... so does that mean I can go back? He practically bounced into his seat, grinning from ear to ear. He thought his father was on his mother's side when it came to the whole possibly-not-returning thing however he had said it just like that, as if it were a fact that he'd be returning. He'd be going back. He didn't have to start a fight with his mother—though... he might possibly have to in the future. There was a chance she could convince Lyall over the summer, so he couldn't let his guard down. Not yet./\/\/\/\/\Dear Peter 10/7/72Okay I must admit I am having quite a difficult time imagining you trekking across "humongous mountains" and "craggy terrain", battling "vicious beasts", carrying five hundred pounds on your back as you go. I think, perhaps, you might be exaggerating a wee bit? Though I've never been camping at all let alone the Muggle way, so I can't really say much except I hope you survive the trip. I don't really want to be down a friend when school starts up. Without you around to balance out James's big head and Sirius's smug attitude I'd probably go mental.I'm sending your homework back with the corrections as well as a list of sections of the books to read to further aid your educational endeavors. You've done really well so far though. Stop being down on yourself. You've got brains! You do. I think the biggest problem is doubting yourself. As well as your spelling. Which is atrocious. Sorry, Petey.I hope it is all right if I borrow Cocoa a bit. Arthur's still off sending letters to James and Lily, and I really need to reply to Sirius too. You know how his owl is, I didn't even have a chance to say hello (speaking of Filibuster, how's your finger doing?).RemusDear Sirius 10/7/72Wow, that's quite a big piece of news! I suppose congratulations to Andromeda and Tonks? Will you be able to see her again? I hope so. I know how much you care about her. It does sound that you're right: that she did marry for love, so at least you've got that. Also it is NOT WEAK AT ALL for you wanting to be sick after her being removed from your family tree (I confess, though, I don't quite understand that part of things). It's also not dumb of you to worry about be although I wish you wouldn't. I'm doing mostly all right. I've had my up and down days, as has my mother. We were both bedridden for nearly all of last week but we're doing better. Mum more than me. I'm still a little tired. But I am recovering quite well now.As for your essay on creatures found in the Forbidden Forest... Acromantula are NOT found in England. I suggest taking out that bit. In addition, I've crossed out some of your misspelled words and written in the proper spelling. I will not, however, write your entire History essay. No matter how many cauldron cakes you promise me.RemusPS: Isn't your brother starting school next term? I'm looking forward to meeting him.PPS: How old do I look?/\/\/\/\/\Dear Remus 9/7/72Arthur doesn't look very well so im gonna send this with Godric. Thanks for your letter & condolences (maybe had to look at your letter to get that spelled right). its been really werd tho like we knew Grandad was going this summer so its not a shock or anything but its still hard to believe hes gone.Im gonna tell you something that i dont want the others to know. Well the first part they know about & that is: i was there when he went. me & dad both. dad held grandad's hand. grandad told me he was proud of me so that was kinda nice to hear i guess. anyway the part not telling Sirius or Peter is this: im having a lot of nightmares now. ive had them every night since. i dont know what kind of nightmares you have probibly not the same as me but since you have em too i know youll understand.Grandad is in his coffin & i reach in to do something i dont know if im patting his hand or what but then suddenly he grabs me & tells me its my time too & pulls me into the coffin & we get buried together. grandads always been good to me so i dont know why im having this all the time. is that weird? i just wish it didnt happen every night. I want to ask for dreamless sleep potion but i know everyone will want to know why & i dont want to say why.James/\/\/\/\/\Dear Remus,NerdSiriusPS: Yes and i dunno Ten?/\/\/\/\/\Ten?TEN!?Remus did NOT look ten! He looked at least eleven! Probably twelve! Some twelve year olds happened to be small just because he was small didn't mean anything. Though he supposed ten was better than nine. But still. Ten?! Stupid Sirius.He wasn't even really sure why he was suddenly so obsessed with looking his age, just that the thought of looking so young really irritated him, especially to Sirius! He stood in front of the mirror, arms folded, lips turned down in a frown. He was so scrawny. He had a hard time putting on any kind of weight because a few nights out of the month he essentially burned off any excess. He didn't eat enough to make up for the energy lost during transformation, even though he ate a lot (especially after full moons). Maybe if he had been naturally big to start with but he wasn't, both his parents were on the smaller side... so he couldn't blame the wolf on his height.He turned to the side, poking his chest then raising his arms, trying to flex. He knew the stereotype of werewolves were Big, Hulking, Monstrous Brutes even in human form. Don't worry about that then, Mum; I'm entirely safe from anyone with that notion in their head. He dropped his arms in defeat, grabbing a shirt to pull on. The last time they had gone clothes shopping they had found some t-shirts whose sleeves went far enough down that he felt safe wearing them in public (aka: down to his elbows). Which meant the t-shirts were big, but at least he could wear t-shirts publicly now and not have to wear long sleeves in hot weather.Before he pulled the shirt on he looked in the mirror again, this time at the horrifying ring of scars around his upper arm. They were puckered and old, but pretty obviously the scar from being bitten by a large animal. He wouldn't get any other scars thanks to the regeneration ability from his wolf, but he'd have this one forever. Marking him as a monster.He yanked the shirt over his head and went downstairs for breakfast.Ugh. Ten?/\/\/\/\/\Lyall worked six days a week, his only day off being Sunday—the day the antiques/thrift shop he worked at was closed. Usually his Sundays were spent puttering around the house, fixing things that he hadn't gotten to over the week, and taking a nap listening to the radio. He didn't really tend to spend much time with Remus, so he was really surprised after breakfast when Lyall asked if he would help him in the garage. Garage typically meant potions which they all knew Remus was crap at, but he agreed, following his father. Lyall moved the car (not very well, he was about as good at driving as Remus was at potions) then set up the cauldron. Remus perched on a stool, the potions book open in his lap. 25 Essential Household Potions for Everyday Use! They'd be working on a cleaning solution."How are things?" Lyall asked as he began working."Um. O-okay. I guess?" Remus shifted, not sure what was going on because something clearly was.Lyall nodded. "You know, you never really talked much about friends in your letters home."He froze up, terrified that his parents had somehow found out. "I—I didn't make friends," he lied, ducking his head, mentally swearing when his stupid haircut meant it couldn't cover his eyes. "I'm not supposed to.""No, no, of course not." Lyall began adding ingredients, avoiding looking at Remus. "You mentioned one girl a few times. In your study group? Er, Evans?""Yeah. We're not friends though.""No," he said again. "Just... I noticed that you mentioned her a few times." Remus began chewing at his thumbnail, no idea how to respond. "Your mother's been telling me about the days I'm at work.""Oh?""Yeah." Lyall moved over to the counter space where he could chop up some ingredients. "Said you've been moody. Surly.""I'm not surly," he protested. "When was I surly?""Talking back to her," Lyall continued, ignoring Remus completely. "Being sassy."What?! "Oh well excuse me if speaking my mind is considered being sassy now!"Lyall turned around, raising his eyebrows. Remus pressed his lips thin, shrinking back. "I think that sort of tone is exactly what your mother means. You used to be such a nice, quiet boy. Now you're... hmm. I guess you learned some of that lip at school.""What lip?" he demanded, blood rushing to his head. What on earth was his father rabbiting on about?! What did this have to do with Lily? Did they think Lily corrupted him or something? "I don't have any kind of attitude. Or tone." This seemed a bit much all things considering. Getting a lecture on his nonexistent attitude.Okay maybe he did have a little bit of an attitude sometimes.Lyall brought the chopped up ingredients over, dumping them into the boiling water. It was getting really hot in the garage. "I'm not really here to talk about your attitude, Remus. That's your mother's realm. I... have to talk to you about other things."Remus sighed, shutting the book since it was clear his father didn't really need his help. "What other things?"Lyall gulped a little, bending in close to the cauldron as he stirred. "You're at that age. I suppose your mother thought it might... not be a problem for a little while since you've always been... so... well, I suppose your size doesn't have anything to do with that."Merlin, he was being called a shrimp again. This was ridiculous."Your mother noticed you've been... preening, more than usual.""I do not preen."His father sighed, wiping some sweat from his forehead. "Perhaps not preen. Just... you're more interested in your own reflection than you used to be.""Dad, wh—what are you trying to tell me? What's this about? Did I do something wrong?"Lyall didn't even seem to hear him. "I was about your age. I remember her very well. Monique Dubost." Remus tried not to groan as his father seemed to be going off on a tangent that had nothing to do with anything. "Her hair is what got me. And her legs, I suppose." Was his father going to seriously talk about some girls legs from his childhood? Why?! "Now, I know at this age it's hopefully just innocent, passing, fleeting thoughts. But you'll be thirteen soon. Things are going to be changing. Maybe not now, maybe not for a few years, but you mother feels I should be discussing this with you now.""Discussing what?"Lyall licked his lips, giving off an aura of anxiety. "You see. When a boy starts liking a girl, a lot, he gets these... urges." He gave a knowing look to Remus who literally had no idea what he was even saying. "Now, these urges can be... intense... at times... erm, pulling, even. The sort of urges that makes... your brain not work properly.""Um. Okay?" Remus put his feet up on higher rungs so he could wrap his arms around his knees, hoping whatever this was about would be over soon."However... your... position in life makes these urges dangerous." Lyall began nodding, as he thought Remus was on the same page as him. "I'm certain you understand this, don't you?""Dad, I honestly have no idea what you're talking about, I'm sorry."Lyall frowned. "I just mean right now, things are innocent. Flirting, maybe some hand holding. But eventually you'll want more. Which you can't do.""What do you mean hand h—" Remus stopped as it suddenly dawned on him, then felt incredibly stupid for not realizing earlier. "Oh—D-Dad, no, no, please—""Sex can be a powerful need—""NO!" Remus clamped his hands over his ears. "NO! MERLIN! PLEASE DON'T DO THIS! I swear to you I have NO urges, ABSOLUTELY ZERO URGES! Oh Merlin I think I'm going to be sick.""Remus, you're growing up, you're already going through puberty—""NO I AM NOT! PLEASE STOP!" What had he done to deserve this?"—and soon you'll be wanting to... do things—""NO I WON'T! Dad, please, I—I'm not going through puberty at all!" Ugh the word sounded so disgusting. Puberty.Lyall gave him an exasperated look. "Yes, you are. The moodiness, attitude—you're starting to get hair."Remus flushed deeply. It was true. He had started to grow some hair... in certain areas... which his mother had seen during the last full moon when he tore his body to pieces the first night and had to spend pretty much half the day naked in the tub while she took care of his wounds and cleaned his body."I swear. I have no urges. I'm—I'm, I'm not thinking about hair or—or anything!" The only person whose hair he ever really thought about or paid any sort of attention to was Sirius's gorgeous locks, so that definitely didn't count since he was... well, a he. "I'm d-definitely not l-looking at legs either!" He buried his face in his hands, wishing he could Disapparate already. Or just... somehow die on the spot. He felt like he could."This is all perfectly natural—""Please," he moaned out. "Please. Can—can we have this talk another time?" Like, never? His father didn't seem completely convinced. "Dad. I promise you. I do not have—thoughts—about girls. Much less urges." He gave his father a desperate stare, partially wishing he could explain to him that this was a slight sore spot with him since his friends noticed girls and he didn't. It made him feel a bit broken sometimes, but of course that would be admitting to having friends. "Please believe me, I swear. I'll swear on anything you want to swear on. I swear on my books. I don't notice girls!"At least Lyall seemed to know that was a serious promise. His books. "Well. All right."Remus breathed out a sigh of relief."Though, perhaps we should talk about masturbation—""GOODBYE!" Remus leapt off the stool and bolted into his house, wondering if it was possible for werewolves to die of humiliation.

Remus did his utmost best to avoid his father over the next few days in case he tried springing the talk on him again. He wished that he had a book about puberty (still a disgusting word) that could help him figure out whether he was or not; he knew if he asked his parents if they could find him a book about that it would result in the talk again. There'd probably be one at the Hogwarts library whenever he went back.He also tried his best not to be surly or sassy towards his mother though with how often she sighed at his responses he figured he wasn't doing too great a job at that. This made him feel very guilty, and he marveled at how horrible he was at being a normal person. He couldn't be a good person at school, now he couldn't even be a good person at home. What was he doing wrong?On the nineteenth Hope and Remus packed up a huge picnic basket full of food (magicked, to stay cool) then drove ages to the beach. Remus was super excited, especially once he could start smelling the ocean. He had the window rolled all the way down, his arm on the edge, head against his arm, wind whipping his (dumb) hair back. Hope beamed the entire trip, very excited. She had grown up near the ocean so was excited to be bringing Remus. Not anywhere near where she grew up, of course. Not even to a magical beach. Just a Muggle beach, for extra safety.But it was amazing. Remus ran barefoot through the sand, all the way to the surf. His toes dug down as the cold water hit his legs, then fell over when it crashed against him a second time. Hope called for him so he returned to her side, helping set up the towels and umbrella. She slathered sun protection on herself then tried to smear it on Remus who kept wriggling."I don't need it!" he whined, wanting to just have fun in the sand. "If I get burnt I'll just heal!""Remus!" she snapped, clamping down on her grip.Remus swallowed and sat still until all exposed skin was protected, which wasn't as much as others as he was wearing a very baggy t-shirt over his swim trunks, to hide his scar even around Muggles. "Can I go back now?""Go have fun. Stay within sight."He ran again, playing in the surf a bit before going a little farther down the beach to peer into tide pools. He got a stick, poking at a dead jellyfish. Then got stung by something inside a tide pool when he tried to catch some critters. He fell back, sucking on his pinky until his werewolf healing ability kicked in and the pain subsided. He tried to find what had stung him but couldn't figure it out. He did find a crab and picked it up, bringing it back to show his mother who screamed and told him to get rid of it."You want to see the dead jellyfish?" he asked after the crab scarpered off."No!"There were a few other families there, mostly little kids, a few teenagers. None seemed to be close to his age so he stayed by himself. He walked down past the tide pools, continuing until he heard his mother shout at him to come back, then turned and went the other way. He waded a little into the water however since he didn't know how to swim he didn't want to go too deeply.He returned to his mother to eat some lunch, starving now. She was talking lightly to another mother, obviously uncomfortable with the conversation. Remus ignored her, getting into the picnic basket for some sandwiches. He flopped down next to his mum, gladly stuffing his mouth."Your daughter's adorable," the other mother said. Hope stiffened while Remus choked on his sandwich, then he gave her a 'see?!' look. Hope blushed very faintly, murmuring a thanks.After eating he took his dad's camera to take some pictures. Of the ocean, of some tide pools, of a cool looking sand castle someone had made. He returned the camera to its bag then returned to the tide pools since there wasn't much else to do. Plus they were fun. He spent most the rest of the afternoon there except occasionally wading, his mother snapping several pictures of him throughout the afternoon... then finally it was getting late so he helped his mum pack everything up."Did you have fun?" she asked as he shook sand off himself, wishing he could use a spell to blast it all off."Oh yes! Thank you so much!" he said, grinning up at her. "It was a lot of fun."Hope kissed the top of his sun-bleached hair. "I'm so glad, sweetie.""You must agree now, though, that this haircut is dumb."Hope gave a long sigh. "You're right. I'm sorry." She tousled his hair before they both got into the car.As they drove away Remus couldn't help but think how much more fun it would have been if the other Marauders had been there too./\/\/\/\/\Remus 19/7/72This is an OFFICIAL INVITATION! TO JAMES! POTTERS! BIG! SUMMER! SPLASH! PARTY! 28TH OF JULY TO 30TH OF JULY!

You are actually going to the beach? Remus Lupin is willingly spending time outside doing outside things instead of reading? Alert the Daily Prophet!James invited me over next weekend but im not going to be able to go. family dinners and all that. i think peter is going. are you going? i wish i could go i miss you guys and want to get away from my family even for one night that would be great. but oh well. July is almost over then we just have august to deal with then finally school again! or Hogwarts really. the school part is boring. youre probably scowling now arent you haha i bet youre alllll done with your homework arent you? i havent really done much of mine except that defense essay which why do we even HAVE defense against the dark arts stuff? dedumb is gone and we will have a new teach. i wonder who its gonna be? i heard rumors Dumbles is trying to get someone from the ministry. least thats what my familys been complaining about. i dont know could be weird to have someone from the ministry working at the school. maybe an auror?SiriusPS okay fine you look 12 happy now?PPS wat do you mean dumb haircut please include photo so i can see i promise i wont make fun/\/\/\/\/\An auror? As a teacher? He read Sirius's letter again then began pacing, chewing at his fingernails. A Ministry worker? Could—that really be happening? A Ministry worker couldn't be told about him, they'd automatically just turn him in! Dumbledore... wouldn't risk that, would he? He couldn't imagine someone working at the Ministry just letting a werewolf... exist... without being... tagged or whatever they did. If he has, Mum and Dad will NEVER let me go back.He collapsed to the floor, yanking Gwyllgi off the bed so he could cuddle his companion, a black stuffed dog he had had since the Christmas after he had been bitten. He was pretty worn out by this point however Hope did her best to keep him in good condition, as did Lyall when Hope wheedled him to do so. He wished he could take Gwyllgi to Hogwarts except anyone who saw him would tease him mercilessly. Baby.Course he probably wouldn't be going back, if Dumbledore really hired on a Ministry worker.Remus sighed, curling into a little ball around Gwyllgi. He wanted to ask Sirius more about the rumors, not sure if that'd be suspicious or not. Surely not? It could come across as mere curiosity about the teacher, right?He was so concerned over the end of Sirius's letter he didn't think about James's letter until he woke up in the morning. Then he recalled the excited bold writing slashed all over the super nice parchment. Oh. He rolled out of bed, debating whether or not to cut open his mattress to look at the 'invitation' again. He remembered James inviting his parents too, then the 'please come?' at the end. He rubbed his forehead, feeling awful for having to say no.I won't reply yet... He trudged over to his dresser, pulling clean clothes out rather absentmindedly. Or, I'll say yes, then send a letter a couple days be—"REMUS!"He spun around as he heard his mother dashing up the stairs, bursting into his room without even knocking. "M—Mum, I'm getting dressed!" he squeaked, even though he was still in his pajamas.She looked furious. She held an envelope in one hand, brandishing it out. To the Parents of Remus Lupin. In James's handwriting.Remus felt like he might vomit."What's this?" she demanded, voice rising. "What's this?""Um, an envelope?"She pulled the parchment out. "This is an invitation! To a-a-a-a party! Remus?!""Is it?" He pretended like he had no idea what it meant, hoping his acting abilities were good enough. Inside it felt like he might explode into a million pieces, terror overflowing from his body. "Can I see it?"Dear Mr. and Mrs. LupinYou and you son are cordially invited to the Potter Manor 28th - 30th July...Remus scanned the letter. It talked about the party a bit, then some stuff about 'I know Remus is prone to illness which is why I'm inviting you as well', etc., etc. Not once did it mention they were friends. Thank Merlin. What could have been an unmitigated disaster might be salvageable.He took in a deep breath, handing the letter back. "I said before that J-James Potter is a dorm mate. He must be inviting all of us to this party. I hardly know him." Hope just stared at him, breathing heavily. "I promise. I b—barely know him at all.""Why would he invite you, then?!""Because I think he must be inviting all of us in that dorm," he said again, speaking slowly, praying that she'd believe him. "I don't know why he'd invite me otherwise. Remember Easter holidays? When he said we were friends, on the platform? He just... assumes. He's popular so he just thinks everyone is his friend, even people like me who barely know him, who doesn't even like him!" He injected as much annoyance into the last part as he could, trying to sound like James was just some idiot who got on his nerves.Hope studied the words on the letter then held it up, ripping the paper in half, watching Remus closely for his reaction. He just smiled. Hope smiled too now, and ripped the letter into little pieces. "I believe you," she said, calming down, pulling him close to kiss his forehead. "Sorry I didn't, sweetie.""It's okay, I understand why you didn't," he replied. "Um, can I get dressed now?"After she left he slumped to the floor, pressing his hands to his face, unable to believe he had gotten away with it, also feeling supremely guilty for the deception. He had considered slowly easing his parents into the idea of him having friends but after seeing the look in his mother's eyes at merely seeing an invitation./\/\/\/\/\Dear James, 22/7/72I'm so sorry you're not doing too well right now. I hope you're starting to sleep a little better, though. I think you should talk to your parents a little bit, if you really need some dreamless sleep potion. You don't need to tell them exactly why. Just tell them you've been having nightmares or perhaps sad dreams? I don't know if that would work or not though.Your Herbology essay is rather good, but it's Venomous Tentacula, not Venomous Tarantula. Also I suggested changing your list of 'Top Five Uses For', as I highly doubt Professor Sprout will appreciate your number one use being 'to throw onto unsuspecting Slytherins' or your third reason of 'a fantastic Christmas gift for people you don't like'. Normally I would say just do some more research but I did lose that bet (thankfully!) so here's some new suggestions: home security? Potion ingredients?Thank you for the invitation to your party, it sounds amazing (do you really have a pool?) however my mother is not doing so great right now. Hopefully by next week she might be on the upswing however I really can't promise to be there. I'll let you know next week. I'm really sorry.Remus/\/\/\/\/\Remus 21/7/72Im alive! barly. the camp trip was HORIBLE!

The only one who didn't send him anything to look over was Lily though she talked a lot about their essays. She wrote to him asking if he'd like to join her on a trip to a magical creatures reserve her parents were taking her on, which he had to decline stating that he had fallen ill. Considering the fact the trip would have been during the full moon it wasn't a total lie.The first full moon of the summer had been awful. The wolf hated the cellar, so whenever Remus went from the house he had at school to the cellar it was always violent. He hoped this second stretch wouldn't be so bad. It was strange, he hadn't ever really thought twice about his transformation location before Hogwarts: a small room underground, no lights, no bedding... nothing whatsoever. That had been his life for nearly seven years. Then once he started Hogwarts he found himself with an entire house to roam around in. Fireplace in the winter, furniture to lay on (or chew up, as the case may be).Now the cellar at home was...Remus peered into the darkness with large eyes, not really wanting to go in. He considered asking his father to spell a light in the corner however didn't want to seem ungrateful or... demanding. After his mother hugged and kissed him multiple times he stepped inside, retreating into the darkness to take his clothes off. His mother waited just past the door, arms wrapped around herself until he held out his clothes."See you in the morning, baby," she said, shutting the door. Because of the spells on the room once the door shut he couldn't hear anything outside (nor could anything outside hear him, the entire point) however he could imagine the locks sliding close.After a moment of utter silence he stepped back until he reached the wall, then knelt down on the ground, shivering from the chill. This was the worst part. Waiting in the dark, naked. Normally he could see very well in the dark except he needed some light—even the slightest bit—and in this cellar there was absolutely nothing.He hoped the moon would filter onto the earth. He despised nights where he remained human all night long. Turning into a slobbering beast was awful enough but laying exhausted on the cold floor, horrifying nightmares plaguing him whenever he attempted sleep, his bones crying out from the sense of the moon behind the clouds... those were worse, because he remembered that. At least as a wolf he didn't remember.Remus winced then began whimpering as the transformation began until the whimpers became screams and the screams became howls./\/\/\/\/\The morning was a haze of blood and pain as his mother helped him to the bathroom to clean out all his wounds, letting him stay in the bathtub until he began healing. Once he stopped bleeding she cleaned him, got him dried off, then helped him to his room. She was oddly quiet during all of this, which was explained in the afternoon when he woke up enough to eat lunch. His mother sat by his bed, watching him eat, lips pursed, brow furrowed."Is something wrong?" he finally asked.Hope shifted a little, nipping at her bottom lip as she debated whether or not to tell him whatever was on her mind. "This came for you, last evening." She pulled an envelope out of her pocket. Still sealed. His name was written on the front in James's handwriting. "The owl seemed quite insistent on leaving it.""Who's it from?" he asked innocently."I don't know. I thought you could tell me.""I've no idea." He held out his hand but after his mother handed it over she just watched him, expectantly. So he had to open it up, sliding the top of the letter out.Dear Remus,Sorry to hear your really sick again, i wish you could make it to the party but if you cant i understand"What's it say?" Hope asked."It's from Potter," Remus said, pushing the parchment back in, not reading any more of it. "I wrote to him saying I was too ill to go to the party this weekend. I-I thought perhaps it would be nice to at least send a 'no thank you' to his invitation," he mumbled, tossing the envelope into the rubbish bin by his bed. "He just wanted to say he was sorry I was sick.""I don't like it," Hope said, smoothing her trousers out in a nervous manner. "It's too familiar."Remus looked down at his lunch tray. "I'm s-sorry," he whispered, poking at the curry on his plate. "He's a very... friendly sort of person so I suppose he thinks... Well, I've hardly ever said two words to him. Except when we're forced to be partners in class." Remus lifted his head, giving his best 'how silly!' smiles.Hope didn't smile back. "You've been using Arthur a lot this summer."Remus kept the smile frozen on his face. "Not a lot. He's been doing his—his own thing a lot. He's getting old. I thought he might enjoy going out when he wants, doing whatever. I have used him some though, for study group. Homework."She studied him closely. "I see..." She looked past him at his bedroom window then back at him, at his plate. "Would you like more?""Oh, yes please, I'm starving." He shoveled the rest of the curry in his mouth then pushed the tray back to his mother. As soon as she left he pulled the envelope out of the bin, took the parchment out, grabbed fresh parchment from his desk, scribbled a few words in the best imitation of James's handwriting he could, put that parchment in the envelope, then let it flutter back into the bin. He tucked James's real letter under his mattress, settling back just as Hope returned with his second helping.He had thought perhaps he was being overly paranoid but after he took another nap when he woke up he found his rubbish bin empty. His heart began pounding at that, a strange feeling creeping in about his mother. Then he shrugged it away. She loved Remus and was just worried about his safety. She had to be a little over the top, obsessive about his relationships with other people. He was doing wrong having friends. He knew he needed to stop. He shouldn't be friends with James. Or Pete. Or Sirius. Or Lily. In fact, he had been planning on ending all those friendships in their upcoming second year.He curled back up, closing his eyes, wanting to throw up at the mere thought. It felt like they had become part of him, somehow; were normal friends like this? Or was it because he was a werewolf? Wolves were pack animals. Was this feeling he had towards them because of that? Did werewolves have that sort of—experience?He sighed, wishing for the millionth time he knew more about his own species.

"No, Remus—darling—be careful...!""I got it, Mum—OW!""Remus!""I'm fine! No, don't come any closer—""You can't use your wand—""I know, I'm fine! I'm just threatening it.""Watch out—""OW! Stupid thing!""You're bleeding.""Won't be bleeding long, I'm all right, I promise. I'm built for this, you're not.""Remus John Lupin!"Remus flinched, then yelped as he was bitten again. He swore under his breath so his mum wouldn't hear then back out of reach of the volantes mordices plant that had taken root in his mother's garden over night."You can't talk about yourself like that!" Hope continued then stormed over, inspecting his hand. "It's still bleeding.""It will heal in a moment, they're not that dark of magic," muttered Remus, pulling his hand back so he could suck at the bite marks. He glared at the plant which snapped at the air at him. He drew his wand out again. "They won't know it's me, not Dad," he said when Hope drew in a quick breath. "Just one quick spell." He didn't want to say he had been using underage magic all summer and it had been going fine so far!"No. We can't risk it." She gently pushed his hand down. "Lyall shall take care of it when he gets home.""Mum, it could lay down a dozen more seeds by then," he said anxiously. "They're very... prolific. Let me try again. If I'm bitten it's fine. Really." He knew his mother hated it whenever he referred to his werewolf abilities, but it really wasn't that big of a deal. He got the kitchen knife back out then approached the plant, trying to remember everything he know about the thing which wasn't much. It was in his Herbology book however for a future year, not his first, as it was deemed rather dangerous. However he had read about it (he had read everything in all his books) so he knew a bit.It bit him five more times before he finally managed to slash the head off, sending the teeth-covered flower rolling across the ground. He ran over, picking it up before it could burrow down. The teeth gnashed a bit, biting him a sixth time before finally giving up. He tucked the thing into a bag then went to dig up the roots which were still pretty shallow. He put the entire plant in the bag then brought it back into the house, dripping blood everywhere."Remus!" Hope cried out as blood began pooling on the table where he set the bag down."I'm fine," he said again, feeling exhausted. It had just been over twenty-four hours since his last transformation so he still felt rather tired. "We have to burn it.""Burn wh...? Oh. Of course." She delicately took the bag, dumping the contents into the sink. Then she tossed a lit match in. They watched the smoke rise up as the plant withered into ashes, then she rinsed the sink out. "Thank you, sweetheart, but I feel it was unnecessary.""Told you, we'd have'em all over the garden if we waited. It wouldn't be good."He had no idea how bad it really would be until supper when they told his father who immediately went pale. "Volantes mordices? Flying Teeth? There was one in the garden?" He set his fork down then bent his head, pressing his hand against his forehead. "Perhaps it was merely a... lone incident...""What's wrong, Lyall?" Hope asked, reaching over to hold his free hand."If it is a sizable enough incident the Ministry gets involved," he said, looking directly at Remus. "Especially near a Muggle community." Remus dropped his own fork, no longer hungry. On the verge of throwing up. "I think I'll tell Ottilie I need a few days off, just in case.""In case of what?" Hope asked, voice choking with fear.Lyall finally turned back to her, reaching down to wrap his hand around hers. "If there is an issue then the Ministry will need to come around to destroy all mordices plants they can find as well as erase Muggle memories if need be.""Merlin's beard," Remus moaned."Language," Hope warned, halfheartedly. "Could it just be one plant? One stray plant?"Lyall sat back, rubbing his chin as he thought. "Might be. If there was just one in the garden. We probably don't have anything to worry about. I'll still contact Ottilie though. Just in case."/\/\/\/\/\Knock knock knock!Lyall and Remus both went absolutely still. It was mid-morning the next day. Hope was in the kitchen while the two male Lupins sat reading in the living room. Lyall lowered his book while Remus pulled his own to his chest, feeling like his heart might leap out of his mouth.Knock knock knock!Hope came to the doorway, eyes wide. Remus hopped off the couch, scurrying over to her while Lyall approached the door. Hope and Remus retreated into the kitchen, hiding out of view. Remus slid to the floor, listening as Lyall cracked the door open."Yes? Hello?""Hello there," said a deep voice. "Sorry to disturb you, Mr...?""L... Lupin.""Mr. Lupin. I'm Mr. Clock, from the Ministry of Magic."Remus covered his mouth, suppressing a cry of fear, feeling like he might pee himself. The Ministry, only a few yards away from him. Hope slid to her knees, wrapping her arms around Remus tightly. He knew it was probably about the plant however he couldn't help worry it was about him."Can I help you?" Lyall asked."Yes, I work for the Department for Herbology and Vegetation Incidents." Remus breathed out a quiet sigh of relief, burying his face against his mother's chest. "It seems in Cwy...Cae... Cywr... ahh, the small wizarding community up north had an occurrence recently, involving volantes mordices. Have you seen any around? Do you... er... know what they look like?""Yes," Lyall said rather weakly. "Or, shall I say, yes to the latter, no to the first. They look rather like daisies only with... sharp teeth?""Precisely. You haven't seen any?""No, sir.""Your... family? Perhaps they've seen some?""My wife hasn't mentioned anything. What exactly is going on?""Ah, well, you see an amateur herbologist in Cwer... Cway... up north, was breeding them illegally—trying to breed various colors, see—and left a window open in her greenhouse. One of the modices escaped and has been spreading. There have been incidents all along the countryside that we've been containing. Is it all right if we look around your property? That was a garden we saw out back, was it not? They tend to prefer gardens.""Ah... y-yes. Of course. If you don't mind taking the outside route, the—the house is rather messy. Wife would never forgive me, I'm sure you understand."Lyall stepped outside, shutting the door. Hope pulled Remus out of the kitchen but he pulled free from her grasp, going upstairs to his room. He tiptoed to the window, peeking out just as his father and two men came into view, heading to the garden. Remus pushed the window open, listening in as they talked about various subjects, mostly the plants. Lyall took them around the garden, the workers complimenting him on how pretty it all looked."My wife takes care of it all...""She does a wonderful job."They also spoke about having to erase the memories of several Muggles in the town that Dragons' Field was attached to. "People dabble in dangerous things they don't truly understand. They think they can contain this savageness when in reality all they're doing is risking the lives of those around them. Positively pathetic, don't you think?""Yes. Of course." Lyall's voice probably sounded normal to the Ministry workers but to Remus he felt they were empty.Remus slumped to the floor, hugging himself. He felt as if the Ministry worker's words had scooped everything out, leaving him raw and hollow on the inside. It was if he knew, saying words specifically to slice into Remus's skin (of course he didn't know, otherwise there'd be the Werewolf Capture Unit there and not the Department of Vegetation Incidents). Still, the barbs stuck. Contain the Savageness. He looked at his hands, at his stubby nails chewed down. Then he slid his finger into his mouth, running his fingertip along the edges of his dull human teeth. Except for his four canine teeth. Those were very sharp. He pressed his finger against one of them harder until it broke the skin and the all-too-familiar taste of blood oozed into his mouth.He turned back round, peeking out the window. The Ministry workers were going off to the forest now, and he heard the back door open and shut. He scrabbled along the floor, hurrying downstairs, wanting to run into his father's arms for reassurance. Lyall's arms were tightly folded, though Hope's were open. So he went to her, once more pushing into her chest as she rubbed his back."They've left," Lyall said. "It was strictly about the plants."Hope sighed, squeezing Remus tightly, slipping into her native Welsh in her relief. "Diolch i'r arglwydd." She kissed the top of his head."They admired your garden," Lyall continued, giving Hope a small smile. "What a compliment. Official employees in the Department of Herbology complimenting your garden.""Oh, they probably just said that," Hope said though Remus could tell by her tone she was flattered. "I wonder what they'd say if they knew it was taken care of by a Muggle."Lyall began chuckling at that then came over, hugging his wife, kissing her cheek. "Probably an apoplectic fit! The Clock family is quite old." He stroked Hope's hair then kissed her on the lips quite passionately. Remus felt awkward still being in his mother's arms and began wriggling free. "Either way, it's over now. We're all right." He glanced at Remus, giving a tight smile. "You're still safe."/\/\/\/\/\My dear Remus, 30/7/72Thank you so very much for the shawl. It is one of the softest articles of clothing I own, made all the much dearer that it was knitted by your own hands. I am suitably impressed! I've found myself simply stroking it, and intend to wear it as often as possible, even if it clashes with my clothes. One perk of being blind is I wear whatever colors I wish and hardly anyone says a thing.I'm pleased to hear you've been practicing your Occlumency whenever possible. I'm looking forward to resuming our lessons in September. A reminder, though, not to expect much when we get back to it. Two months without actively practicing against Legilimens means your mind will have gone back a bit. However you'll soon return to where you were before, soon exceeding.Now, I don't mean to alarm you but there is an important piece of news I must share. A good friend of mine, Ant (I think you would like him), keeps me abreast of any werewolf reports whenever he can. It seems there is a proposition being pushed forward at the Ministry this summer involving branding werewolves. I highly doubt this will go through. While anti-werewolf sentiments run strongly through the Ministry of Magic, this is largely viewed as going to the extreme—Thank Merlin for that! If this does go through it will be all over the papers. If it does not go through, it will shock me if it's even mentioned in a tiny article near the end of the Prophet. So this time no news will indeed be good news. I'm told it should happen around the Tenth of August.Also I am very sorry to hear about your unfortunate hairdresser incident, and that your hair isn't growing out at the rate you desire. I regrettably inform you that my Legilimency abilities do not extend to psychically being able to grow someone's hair out, as fun as that would be. Also I will not tell you the hair-growing spells as you are not permitted to do magic out of school. I am sorry.Until we meet again in a few weeks,M. Fawley/\/\/\/\/\On August first his second year letter came from Hogwarts, listing the few books he'd need. Most his first year books would carry forward so there were only three listed to buy: The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2, History of Dueling, and Battling The Dark. He looked at the two needed for Defense Against the Dark, wondering again who would be heading the class. Dueling? That did make him think it'd be an auror, which sent a chill down his spine.No other new items, nor new uniforms since he had mostly grown into his old ones. They were still a little baggy here and there, very worn out, but absolutely no need to purchase new since they fit."Mum?" Remus held up the letter, heart pounding hard as he awaited her response. They hadn't really discussed school since his haircut. He hadn't pressed it, his mother never spoke about him not returning.Hope took the letter, a crease forming in her forehead. "Dueling? I don't like the sound of that. Sounds dangerous.""I won't be dueling myself, just learning how to protect myself if the need arises," he explained. "We learned a few very simple spells last year. It's not actually dueling." Her finger traced over the words while Remus waited. Confirmation. He just needed... confirmation... "Mum?" he finally asked when she remained silent. "When I came home you seemed... as though I shouldn't return to school." He scratched lightly at the table, throat choking a little as he couldn't wait any longer for a yes or no. "Am I? Returning?"Hope let out a long sigh then pushed the letter back to him. "Lyall insists," she said and Remus fought back a grin. "I wish you wouldn't. It's safer here, for you. If... you tell him you'd rather stay home...""No," he said a little too quickly. Hope gave him a look, and Remus did his best to sound a little less... excited. "You know I love school. Not as much as I love you, of course." He took her hand, giving her his best smile. Hope smiled back, reaching out to stroke his cheek. "But, I mean, even after I graduate at eighteen I'll have spent less than my life there, so it's not so much time. In the long run.""But an important time," she murmured. "You should be safe—""I am safe there."Hope withdrew, shaking her head. "I'll never believe that however Lyall has put his foot down. Perhaps by next year I can convince him.""When should we go get my books?" He stared at the letter again, wondering what would be inside the new books, wondering what sort of teacher the new one would be. Would they be like another Professor Dedenne? Despising him because of his curse? Purposely failing him? Or would they at least tolerate him enough to give him fair grades? Whoever it was, they were obviously wanting to focus on dueling. James and Sirius will like that, he thought with a snort."No need to go in," Hope said, getting up. "I'm sure Lyall will be able to find them himself."Remus felt a little disappointed but his overwhelming joy at the certainty of going back to Hogwarts overrode any other feelings. He mumbled a 'thanks' then went up to his room to sit in the window, watching the rain fall, wondering how he'd make it through the next couple of weeks./\/\/\/\/\Dear Remus, 1/8/72My letter has come in! I'm assuming yours has as well. Two new books for Defense Against the Dark Arts! I wonder who our new teacher will be? I still cannot believe Professor Dedenne left like that though I suppose I shouldn't say much considering why she left. I mean, I am surprised but glad. I'm not trying to sound not glad. Does that make sense? I am GLAD she is GONE! In any case, when are you going in to Diagon Alley? I'd like to go in on the same day as you so at least we can see each other a little bit before school starts. Four more weeks. One month! Exactly! Then we'll be sitting on the Hogwarts Express again. It's a little funny to me now to think something as Muggle as a train is what takes us to Hogwarts. Doesn't it seem funny to you?I can't wait to be back among magic. It seems so strange here now. Mother sets the food on the table instead of everything appearing. Nothing floats, nothing changes form. If it weren't for being able to visit Sev I think I might go a little mad. Isn't it awful? I love my family so much. Mum and Dad and Pet. I adore them. But now it sort of feels like something more is missing. I hate to think I've changed so much, but there you go. I tried talking to Severus about this however he didn't understand at all. He kept saying, of course something is missing, magic is missing. He looks as me as if I were crazy when I talk about how I wish I could be more content during my time at home. He asked me how I could be content when it's all 'so mundane'. His words. Mundane. Muggle. Dreary. Dull. Sometimes he sets my teeth on edge with the way he talks but I can't really blame him all that much. I know it's difficult for magic folk to imagine a life without. It isn't dull at all. I think you, from what I can imagine, would understand that?Things with Petunia aren't going so well. It seems every turn we fight. What a sneer she had on her face when I got my letter this morning. She promptly complained about 'dirty birds' fouling up the dining room. Says if magic is so 'neat' how come they haven't thought of a cleaner way to send messages? Personally I like the whole owl mail thing. It's super. Plus Bessie is wonderful, and I do like Arthur too.Well hopefully see you in Diagon soon!Love,Lily/\/\/\/\/\James's letter hurt Remus's heart. He sounded positive however only Peter had come to his party. Sirius's family had some dinner thing, James wrote, and i hope your doing better. He included a photo of him and Peter sitting on the edge of an indoor pool, feet dangling in, both of them with big smiles. Remus frowned, touching the picture, wishing he could have gone."I'm sorry," he said to the photograph. He felt even worse since Sirius couldn't go, so it had just been the two of them. Hopefully they had fun. Judging by their grins they did, at least. James also asked when Remus was going into Diagon. He wrote back the same thing he had told Lily: I won't be going into Diagon Alley. There is a used bookstore near where my father works and he is going to try to get my books there. I'm sorry. He also apologized for not going to the party.I'll see you on the train though. I can't wait to see you guys again!Remus folded up the letter, attaching it nervously to Godric's leg while James's owl fluttered just as nervously, not liking Remus so close. "Sorry," he muttered. "Okay there you go."He watched the eagle owl fly off then went back to bed, stomach hurting from all the guilt, wishing he could just be a regular kid so he could meet up with his friends./\/\/\/\/\Remus,this summer is agony. asbolute agony! time is just crawling by. it feels like every day has fifty hours in it. im so BORED! i wish i could have gone to jamess party at least that would give me a break from this. the big family dinner was awful without Andromeda. her absense was miserable. at least i still have Uncle Alphard.but enough about my dumb family (exeptions of regulus and uncle alphard of course). when are you going into Diagon? we're going in next weekend. james is going in then too and were trying to get pete to go too so hopefully you can too. i miss you guys too much. i have nothing to do exept talk to Regulus. which isnt BAD hes great just theres only so much you know? i miss pranks. i even miss detention. i guess maybe i should do the rest of my homework but im probably going to wait until the train so you can help me?Regulus keeps asking me questions about school but then sometimes he will look at me and then say something about me being a gryffindor and not a slytherin so 'i guess you cant tell me too much'. i hate to say reg is definitly going to be in slytherin but... hes going to be in slytherin. i wish he wouldnt be. but maybe its better he is. i feel like whenever i try to get off the topic of my family it just goes back. i guess since there all i have right now. exept for letters from you james and peter. thanks for keeping me sane (ha ha not theres much of sanity in me right?)ugh 4 weeks to goSiriusRemus got a headache finding out that Sirius hadn't done his homework yet, that he was putting it off till the first of September. Or later, as the first was a Friday so they'd have an entire weekend before classes started. He figured the other Marauders would be super excited about that. He was too... but he was also excited for classes to start again. He missed them, missed learning. Sometimes he couldn't fathom how his friends were so... dismissive of their education. Learning was wonderful. Pushing yourself mentally, reaching for new knowledge... augh, he loved it. Had always loved it, had read through all of the books in the house, a lot of them multiple times until Lyall realized and began bringing new (well, used, but new to him) books home to Remus to consume as well. He knew his son was a precocious reader and even when he was eight he was reading heavy tomes intended for adults. But reading was nothing compared to classes, to learning that way.He had never expected to go to Hogwarts in the first place. He still remembered that day Professor Dumbledore came to the house, wondering why such a (gifted) young wizard wouldn't be attending. He shivered remembering his words. Hogwarts welcomes you with open arms. Indeed it had, for the most part (he decided it'd be better not to count Professor Dedenne). More than he ever expected including some pretty great friends even if some of them were idiots. Putting off homework until school started, for Merlin's sake./\/\/\/\/\Remus hadn't told his parents about the contents of Fawley's letter, namely the whole branding-werewolves thing. On the tenth he made sure to carefully read every inch of the Daily Prophet which made no mention of this proposition. Nor did it on the eleventh. On the twelfth he got a letter from Fawley who told him it had been shot down. Too far, she explained. Too much. Praise Merlin.He felt joyful over this news but also curious. Who said it was too far or too much? Who at the Ministry actually said, no no, don't do this to werewolves. The Ministry hated them. So who was it? Why? He wasn't complaining, just very curious.Contain the savageness. He went to the bathroom to stare at his reflection. Pale skin, dark circles under his eyes, limp hair (finally starting to grow out of that dumb style). He reached up, running his fingers across his smooth skin, wondering how different he'd look if he hadn't been bitten. Bigger? Healthier, for sure. Rosy cheeks? Bright eyes? It seemed incomprehensible to him to even try to imagine.One thing for sure, I'd be in Ravenclaw, not Gryffindor. He stalked out of the bathroom, hugging his thin arms around himself. Probably wouldn't have made friends with the Marauders, or possibly Lily.That seemed incomprehensible to him too.

Author's note: A couple things. One, I was asked for my posting schedule for this story and I apologize for never thinking before to say anything anywhere on here! I upload on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Friday, with an extra chapter on occasion. Two, I recently found out that fanfiction dot net's app has a COMPLETELY separate PMing system than the main site! So if you use the app only and have commented on my story with questions, I HAVE replied to them but they don't get sent to the app as far as I know, they get sent via the website. Three, speaking of comments I do try to reply to every comment that I can. If I miss a comment I am so sorry, I like to respond to every single one but I'm sure eventually one or two might get overlooked. If there are any pressing questions you have don't hesitate to PM me. And four, Sirius's side story! I haven't updated lately because I am quite unhappy with it. I feel like it's not as strong as this main story, and feel I rushed it a little too much. I am currently deciding between scrapping it and starting over, or just continuing with it. Either way it will be continued I promised, just not quite yet. Sorry for the SUPER length note but I wanted to address all these issues. Onto the story!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Lyall brought home used copies of the three books Remus needed for school, though the one about dueling was relatively newly published so Remus knew it had probably cost a bit more even used. Still, he had them now, and began reading through them voraciously; it was exciting seeing the new spells they'd be learning in Charms, as well as learning about various famous duels throughout history and the spells used in them. Battling the Dark was pretty interesting too. If these books were anything to go by, the new Defense teacher might be a really hands on/active sort of teacher.Will they hate me though? Do they work for the Ministry? Remus sat in his window, watching the rain outside, hugging the dueling book to his chest. He wanted to write to someone, ask them. There wasn't anyone he could, though. He considered Professor McGonagall but as nice as she was to him he didn't want to bother her over her holiday. He'd just have to wait. Only a couple more weeks anyway.He found he was agreeing with Sirius's most recent letter, about being bored. He was bored. Very bored. He skulked about the house, wishing the first would come already, wishing he could see his friends, wishing he could just go to class. He redid his essays for the millionth time, editing, reediting, adding new, taking out. He also wrote a few essays based on the new Defense books, just to get a feel of it. He practiced wand movements without doing the spells, trying to memorize flourishes and flicks. He asked his dad for some tips on a tricky dueling spell he saw in the Fighting book but Lyall just frowned at him, telling him he'd probably learn in class.On nice days he went outside, puttering around in the garden, occasionally going out into the woods to explore or else read by the stream. But boy was he bored. He began counting the days down, staring miserably at the calendar every day. Sirius was right, the days are now fifty hours, not twenty-four. Wasn't summer supposed to be the best part of the year? Remus just felt depressed./\/\/\/\/\Remus, 13/8/72hey is it possible to die by heat if you dont have magic around to help you not be over hot? or by getting completly tired? cuz grandpa is taking me camping aGIN! this time its a LONGER HIKE! and its SO HOT! im definitly going to die. if i do you can have my booksYour soon to be dead friend, PeterDear Remusthis is summer is absolute bollocks. your smart is it possible to die of boredom and misery? please let me know because i think i may perish before school starts. if i do die you can have all my books.sincerly, Siriusly BoredHey Remus! 15/8/72is it possible for someone to die of exitement?

Two until school. Hope watched him as she cleaned the living room then poked at him with a feather duster until he agreed to help out with the chores instead of 'moping about'. He trudged around, grumbling as he worked. He didn't want to clean, he wanted to brood. Which was probably what his father was talking about weeks ago, about his 'attitude'. Sure enough Hope kept cutting him annoyed glances."Stop complaining," she said. "I can hear you muttering and griping."Remus scowled, dragging a bucket out. "I need to do some homework.""No you don't, you've done it all. Multiple times. You said so, the other night. Therefore, you have plenty of time to clean." Hope said then she whipped around as Remus muttered something. "What did you just say?""Nothing, Mummy.""What did you say?""I didn't say anything," he whined as she stormed over. He fidgeted uncomfortably. How could she have heard that?! She was a regular person, their hearing couldn't be that good. "I said it's boring.""You most certainly did not!" Hope's face was white with fury. "You tell me right this second what you said."He fidgeted more, looking at the ground as he scuffed the toe of his slippers against the rug. "I said it's bloody boring." He peeked up through the tip of his fringe, hoping that would do it. Hope folded her arms. Nope. "I said it's bollocks," he mumbled.Hope sniffled loudly. "That is what I thought you said. We do not use language like that in this household.""Dad does," he grumbled, folding his arms too."You are not your father!" Hope snapped."It'd be weird if I was," Remus retorted then immediately regretting it."Remus!" Hope looked livid and he knew he had gone too far. She marched over, taking hold of his shirt, dragging him to the stairs. "Go to your room.""Okay.""Wait." She stopped, still holding him. "You'd like that. You're... you're grounded!""Grounded? From what?!" he snapped back. "I don't do anything! I don't go anywhere!"She stared at him for a moment then looked over at the table by the couch. "This." She went over, picking up the book he had been reading. "You're grounded from this.""You—you're grounding me from a book!?" he demanded, completely taken aback."Yes! You never spoke like this before school. School is having a bad influence on you! Now—now go sit down for a few minutes and think about what you've done. You can have your book back in a couple days."Remus stomped over the corner and sat down, arms crossed tight over his chest, scowling. He glared as Hope continued cleaning then after about ten minutes he asked if he could go. She said no, so he had to wait longer until she told him to just get back to cleaning. He banged about, keeping his mouth shut, until finally they were done and she released him. He ran up to his room, flinging himself onto his bed as he hugged Gwyllgi. It wasn't fair. He wasn't doing anything, why did she have to go and make him do chores? He would have done them later, if she had asked, just... he had been enjoying laying there brooding. Now she was probably going to complain to his father again, and Lyall was going to be annoyed. It really wasn't fair.Sure enough Lyall gave Remus a bit of a lecture that evening, about respect, using proper language, blah-blah-blah. Remus nodded in all the right spots, promised he'd be nicer to his mother, then hid out in his bedroom the rest of the night./\/\/\/\/\Remus didn't just need the books he also needed other things for school as August approached its end. Parchment, ink, new quills, a refilled potions kit. He rather hoped he could go into Diagon for this but Lyall got everything after work one evening. A little disappointing, which he kept to himself. Instead he focused on going through the potions kit, checking out the new ingredients. He didn't open any of the little vials or bags, dreading when he had to use most of them. Potions was his weakest subject. Mainly due to his strong sense of smell. He knew he'd have some problems even without that—for some reason instructions didn't seem to stick to his brain. He tended to stir the wrong way, cut up the ingredients the wrong way... no matter how hard he tried, his potions came out less than perfect. It drove him a little batty, not that he told that to anyone. He was good at everything else, everyone had a weak subject. It just... burned him that something like that was his weak subject.Then the days trickled by slowly. Remus felt his mood growing sourer. He had to fight off the urge to snap at his parents. It just seemed like with school just on the horizon every little thing bugged him. Especially as the moon grew closer. On the morning of the first phase he felt even more irritable than usual. He glared at his breakfast, ignored his mother when she tried to make small talk, slept on the couch, grouched about school still being a week away, then stormed about the house feeling like he wanted to pull himself inside out.Of course that night he more or less did. His body ripped apart in the darkness, bones cracking, skin peeling, fur sprouting, teeth elongating into fangs which sliced into his still-human lips until they pushed out into a muzzle. His screams turned to howls, his mind shrank into nothing. When he woke up at dawn—the wolf shrinking painfully back into human—he found himself in a large puddle of drying blood, gashes and cuts all over his body, great big teeth marks ringing one of his calves.The next morning was worse, then the third not quite so. He spent the day dozing on and off, eating the food his mother brought him, sleepily snuggling next to her as she stroked his hair and sang Muggle songs. He felt quite bad for being so rude to her over the past few weeks and mumbled an apology before drifting back into sleep./\/\/\/\/\Remus tried to stay on his best behavior during his last week at home. He bit back his sarcastic responses, tried not to roll his eyes, and wished he didn't feel this way. He supposed it was puberty which was absolutely gross. Everything he knew about the miserable process (which admittedly wasn't as much as he probably should) seemed disgusting and annoying.But finally, finally, it was the end of August. He packed everything up in his trunk and after thinking about it for a while he put Gwyllgi in as well. He'd keep it in his trunk probably, intending to only use it for emergencies when no one else was around. He packed away clothes, books, some candy his parents bought him for his time at school, all his school supplies. He also cut into his mattress which was bulging with letters by this point, putting them all in his trunk as well as the photo album. Then he packed up his school satchel with some stuff for the train. His uniform to change into, a couple books, more candy.He barely slept that night. Only a few more hours until I see all of them again. He tossed and turned, finally giving up to open his window and lean into the chilly night breeze which felt good against his face. He looked up at the moon which was already at the halfway point, feeling glad that he wouldn't have to worry about the next one until nearer the end of September; his first year the full moon happened right at the beginning, his first weekend.He did manage to get some sleep and woke up with a stomachache realizing he had a problem on his hands. The platform. He could see his friends coming over to greet him before they got on the train, his mother seeing them, hearing them chatter about being friends. He ate breakfast slowly, trying to figure a way out of this. Maybe if we get there last minute... So he slowed down eating. It took him ages to finish, ages to take a shower, ages to get dressed. His mother didn't seem too worried. Of course, she'd love it if he missed the train entirely and had to spend the rest of the day with her until Lyall got home from work to sort things.But he had miraculously timed it well. They got to the car park with a few minutes left. Remus got a trolley, sprinting through the station with his mother on his heels. She hesitated when they reached the barrier."You can stay out here," he said, trying not to sound excited."No, I'll go in with you." She took hold of his sleeve as they ran through. The platform was crowded with parents waving goodbye to their children. The train workers were blasting their whistles, demanding everyone get on board now if they wanted to make it. "Oh, Remus, we hardly have time!" Hope said, squeezing his arms.Remus put his arms around her, hugging tightly. "I love you, Mum. I'll write loads, I always do."She kissed his forehead, keeping her hands attached to his shirt. "Please be safe—""All aBOARD!""I will!" Remus wriggled, trying to get free. "I need to go. Please...""I love you.""I love you too, Mum!" He got loose and pushed the trolley over. The clerk looked annoyed but helped him get it into the luggage compartment. Remus waved at his now-sobbing mother one more time before jumping onto the train. He barely got down the corridor when the train lurched, beginning its journey.I couldn't've cut it closer! he thought, putting his hand against the wall to steady himself. He nearly fell over anyway. Once he got used to the train's motion he began walking again. Time for the arduous task of finding my friends. He tried to pay attention to the myriad of scents assaulting his nose but there were too many and he was overwhelmed. He considered knocking on doors but when he reached his first door he felt crippling shyness take over. He couldn't bring himself to even raise his fist. You won't find them if you don't, he thought as he tried peering through windows. Most of the curtains were pulled back so he was able to see in, however several had their curtains closed.Finally he began knocking at doors with closed curtains. Students he didn't recognize opened up and he'd mumble an apology before wandering off to the next closed-up compartment. He finished the first carriage, then the second, making his way towards the front, feeling sweaty that he hadn't seen anyone he recognized. Maybe this was a nightmare. Maybe he was asleep, dreaming this entire thing."Remus!" A door slid open and a lovely face surrounded by a cloud of red hair poked out."Lily!" Remus's face split into a smile and he hurried over. She pounced at him, hugging tightly. He anxiously hugged back, glancing into the compartment to see who else was there. Thank Merlin it was Snape who looked ready to murder Remus. He hated Snape (and Snape hated him) but it wasn't her female friends who'd be giggling over their hug since they didn't seem to believe a boy and a girl could be just friends."How come you're not with Pettigrew, Thing One, and Thing Two?" she asked when they pulled apart. She had gotten a lot taller over the summer which irritated him; she was now a good two inches taller than him! It wasn't fair at all. Her dark red hair had been cut to just below her chin and she had fringe now, straight across just above her eyes."Haven't found them yet," he replied. "Do you know where they are?""I believe they're in the carriage ahead of ours," Snape hissed out, getting to his feet. "So I suggest going there. As quickly as possible.""Sev," Lily warned. Snape just pursed his lips, glaring at Remus some more. "Er, I'd invite you to join us..." Lily trailed off.Remus shook his head. "Thank you however I do want to find the others. I'll catch up with you later?"Lily gave him another hug then Remus hurried to the next carriage. He immediately knew which closed-up compartment held his friends, or at least assumed so: a sign was tacked up on the door saying 'do not enter'. He knocked at the door as loudly as he could, then he heard someone shout 'go away!'. James's voice. Remus tried the door (locked) then rapped his knuckles once more against the glass."I said go aw—" The door slid open slightly, one hazel eye behind glasses going from narrowed to wide as he realized who stood there. "—REMUS!" The door was shoved all the way open and James grabbed him, yanking him in for a tight hug. Remus choked a little as James swung him around into the compartment, shutting and locking the door behind them.Then as soon as he was let go he was hugged again, this time by Peter. "Remus!""We were getting worried about you," said Sirius as he gave Remus a one-armed-half-hug before tousling his hair."We were running late." Remus tried not to beam too much, feeling utterly relieved at the greeting. Part of him had been worried that despite their letters they really hadn't been looking forward to seeing him again, that they decided not to be friends. Especially James, because of the party. But they were all grinning at him, crowded in the small space between seats. Remus wanted to hug all of them again but kept his arms to his side. They still like me."Very late, by the looks of it," James said.Remus took in his friends after not having seen them for so long. James had gotten a bit taller and scrawnier, his hair a little longer and therefore a lot messier. He was dressed in clothes very sixties—vivid tie-dyed shirt, bellbottoms. His brown skin was even browner from being outside all summer. Sirius had gotten a lot taller though didn't have the same gangliness that James seemed to have. He was still as pale as ever and his inky black hair was down past his chin now in beautiful waves. He was already dressed in his Gryffindor uniform; brand new, of course. Peter hadn't grown taller much though he had grown thinner (probably from all the hiking) and tanner (also from the hiking). His usually mousy-brown hair had turned nearly blonde from all the sun. He was in simple denim jeans with a mustard-colored polo shirt."You've gotten taller," Peter remarked to Remus."A bit," he said cheerfully. He was almost the same height as Peter now! Though looked littler due to his very small frame."You're still a shrimp," Sirius said with a wicked grin.Remus scowled at him. "No, you're just unnaturally tall," he said as he slid into one of the seats. Pete perched next to him while the two black-haired boys sat across from them. That was when he realized they weren't alone. He hadn't noticed before at all, being too excited to see his friends.This new person was a slightly smaller version of Sirius, pushed far back into the corner of the seat, obviously trying to make himself look even smaller—Remus did this plenty of times and recognized it. He had the same pale skin as Sirius, the same inky black waves (only a bit shorter), and very similar facial features except his face was a little bit broader, his nose not quite as long, and his eyes a dark brown instead of silvery grey though framed with the same lovely long lashes. He was wearing a high-necked black silk shirt, black trousers, and a slight scowl."Remy, this is Regulus," Sirius said as he propped his very long legs up on the seat between Remus and Peter. "Reg, this is the final member of our group—Remus." Sirius's little brother just nodded slightly then turned to look back out the window. "Reg, at least say hello.""It's n-nice to m-meet you," Remus said with what he hoped was a friendly smile."Hello," Regulus said stiffly, not even looking.James clapped his hands. "Now we're finally together again! The Marauders in full force.""Hogwarts watch out," Pete said, making them all laugh."Hogwarts most certainly better watch out," said Sirius, tossing his hair back. "I had a very boring summer and spent most my time thinking up pranks. Or... possibilities of pranks, I should say, that Remus can smooth out.""Why me?" Remus asked, not particularly put out but not wanting to just give in.Sirius bent forward and tapped Remus's head. "Brains, duh.""Oh. Right. Thanks, Beauty," replied Remus, rolling his eyes.That got Regulus's attention. He turned away from the window, giving Sirius a puzzling look. "Beauty?" he asked, eyebrows raising.Sirius grinned. "My nickname. I'm Beauty. He's Brains. Peter's Blithe since he's the nice one, and James is Brawn since he's the athletic one.""... Beauty?" Regulus asked again, disbelieving."Blacks might be crap but there's no denying we're all beautiful," Sirius said simply. Regulus's lips twitched downward when Sirius said 'crap'. "Mostly. There's a few not-so-pleasant-to-look-at cousins." He then began coughing which had the name 'Bellatrix' in it.Regulus lowered his gaze. "You shouldn't be so rude about Bellatrix." Then he looked back out the window.Sirius rolled his eyes then mimed using his wand to hex his own brains. James snickered."So, er, Regulus, are you looking forward to school?" Pete inquired.Regulus blinked, glancing back over. "I suppose. I'm looking forward to being in Slytherin." His eyes darted towards a now angry Sirius then back down."I'm sure Slytherin w-will be a g-good fit for you," Remus said but it was no use."That your own thought or did Mother tell you to say that?" Sirius demanded. Regulus pressed his lips thin, not responding. "Slytherin isn't the end all be all.""For anyone worth anything it is," Regulus whispered, fingers curling into little fists pressing against his thighs.Sirius's nostrils flared while James looked nervously over at Remus and Pete. "Hey, uh, Sirius—" James tried, putting a hand on his shoulder."You're just miming what they told you," he hissed out, shaking James's hand off. Regulus shrank back even more in the corner. "Slytherins are bullies.""Stop that!" Regulus went a little white. "If you're just going to insult everyone, I shan't stay.""Oh and who am I insulting?""Me!" Regulus cried out in a thin voice. "I'm a Slytherin.""You aren't." Sirius leaned forward. "You don't have to be," he added in a whisper so low Remus wasn't sure if James or Peter could hear it.Regulus drew back as if Sirius were pouring poison onto him. "I am," he said, trembling.Sirius stared at him a moment then got up, taking his brother by the arm and pulling him out of the compartment. James and Peter both looked uncomfortable while Remus shifted in his seat. The two Blacks were talking quietly outside but Remus could still hear them well enough."You don't have to do everything they tell you," Sirius said darkly. "I don't.""Look what it's gotten you," Regulus replied, sounding horrified. "A miserable existence—""I'm happy at school. I've got friends—""Yes, well, I know all about them.""What do you mean by that?""Mother and Father told me about them. Two half-dirty-bloods and a blood trai—"There was a thudding sound that even James and Peter heard. They both stared at the door. "Don't you ever call them that," Sirius snarled. "Ever."There was a whimpering sound. "You're hurting me."Quiet. Then, "Shit. I—Reg...""I'm—I'm just trying to help...""Being a mindless servant isn't helping.""I'm not!""You're just spewing out whatever they tell you.""I do not!" Regulus sounded like he might cry. "You're just... being stubborn. If you'd try a little harder..."Sirius let out a barking laugh. "I'm sick of trying with this family.""Yes, that's quite evident by how you acted this summer." Then Regulus's voice dropped so low Remus couldn't quite make out everything he said next. "...get about me... tent on destr...""I'm intent on living my own life," Sirius replied very coldly. "You should be too.""I am," Regulus replied, just as coldly. Their voices sounded so similar in that moment that it sent goosebumps down Remus's arms. "Just because what I want happens to align with the Black ways doesn't make me less than you.""Is that what you truly want?"Quiet. Then, "I want to be a Slytherin.""Then go be a Slytherin. A cold-hearted, bullying, nasty Slytherin who loathes anyone who's the slightest bit different, just like them."Another thudding sound then the door flung open and Sirius stormed in while Remus caught a glimpse of Regulus looking pure white and completely dejected; but then Sirius slammed the door shut behind him. He took in a deep breath, running his fingers through his hair before putting on a vague smile. "Sorry about that," he said in a fake cheerful voice as he threw himself into the seat by James again. "Brothers, eh?"James, Peter, and Remus who were all only children just sort of nodded in agreement, not sure what else to do. It wasn't a great start to their new year at all.

Things were a little stiff for a bit after Sirius fought with his brother but soon James began chattering about his summer, easing away the tension. He talked about his new broom and all the rides he took, about how his parents already bought him a uniform for the Quidditch team. Then Peter complained about all his hiking trips and showed them the spot on his arm where he had been bitten by the spider though it was long gone. Sirius spoke briefly of his summer, mostly just highlighting how boring it had been, then all of them looked expectantly at Remus."You spent most the summer sick, didn't you?" James asked, adjusting his glasses."Er, yeah," Remus said. "It wasn't a very good summer. Except the beach trip, that was nice. I saw a dead jellyfish.""Ooh!" all three of them chorused excitedly."Did you touch it?" Sirius asked."I poked it with a stick. It was all..." Remus flapped his hand to indicate. "It was cool. I have a picture!" He dug around in his bag, pulling out the stack of photographs which Sirius snatched instantly. "Hey!""Where's your dumb haircut?" Sirius shuffled rapidly through the pictures."Hey, that's right, you complained half the summer 'bout that!" Peter said, leaning forward to look at the contents of the photos. "None of these are of you!""For th—that reason!" Remus grumbled. "I left all the ones my mother took at home.""That's rather rude of you," James said. "You talked about that hair. We want to see.""No."They all crowded on one seat so Remus could talk about the various photos. They all oohed again over the dead jellyfish, as well as the other little critters Remus saw. Then Pete got out a huge album full of pictures he took on his hiking trips which were all very lovely. Peter had talent as a photographer, so several of the photos were artistic. Bright light shining through leaves, dew glistening on a mossy log, the shadow of gnarled branches across a sunny rock. Then there were some of his grandfather who rivaled Professor Slughorn for rotundness and didn't look at all the sort to go hiking across perilously rocky trails. After the album James showed off his photographs which were mostly of him on his new broom."I can't wait to show you two," he said to Sirius and Remus. "Peter gave it a go.""Don't talk about it," Peter moaned.James grinned. "He fell. Broke his wrist.""It hurt! All you did was laugh at me!""Well you laughed at me when that bird hit me.""That's different, that's funny."Remus studied one of the pictures closely. It looked like there was silver on the broom. "What kind of broom is it?""StarShooter900," James said which didn't help any since he knew nothing about brooms."I'd've taken photos of my summer however it would just be dozens of pictures of my bedroom ceiling," Sirius said, flopping back, blowing his hair out of his face. "I wish I could have gone to your party. Be better than that stupid dinner thing. Course almost anything is better than dinner with extended family." Sirius rolled his eyes. "An army of snobby cousins.""Ew," James said. Sirius nodded. "Speaking of cousins, did you know we're related?"Sirius sat upright. "Are we? I wondered.""My Uncle Charlus," James explained, "married your Great-Aunt Dorea. I asked, when they came to visit for Grandpa's funeral.""I never see her," Sirius mused, rubbing his chin. "Grandfather's sister. Grandfather does't like her—I suppose I understand, now. Though she's not blasted off the family tree so I guess they don't fully consider the Potters as Enemies."James snorted. "That's good to know.""Didn't they have a kid?""Yeah, cousin Boreas." James gagged loudly. "Boreas. More like Bore-My-Ass. You're lucky you don't have to deal with his speeches. He doesn't talk, he gives speeches. Ugh, plus he always looks down on me like I'm a bug.""Um, I saw in the paper your father's age," Peter said. "So your parents didn't have you until they were quite old?" Remus thought that was a rude question but James didn't seem bothered."Yeah. They were both in their fifties," James said, settling back as he shuffled through the photos from his summer. "Mum wasn't supposed to be able to have kids. Or, maybe it was Dad? I dunno. Either way, I was a very, very, very, very big surprise." He grinned broadly at that. "Actually I think that's why Boreas hates me. Cause until I came along, he was the in-line-Heir to the Potter fortune. Cause if Dad died without a kid, the fortune would've gone to Uncle Charlus then to Boreas. But, here I am. Heir to one of the biggest Pureblood fortunes in the country.""Are you really that rich?" Remus asked.James blinked a few times then pushed his glasses up. "Um. Yes. Potters are one of the richest families around. Course a lot of that is cause Dad's a genius. Doubled our money. Or trebled. I don't remember. Oh! Look at this picture! Pete took it right when I belly flopped..."Remus had always known James had money, just never realized how much. It felt a little weird knowing this now, that one of the richest (maybe the richest?) kid at school had befriended one of the poorest. It shouldn't make me feel as self-conscious as it does, he thought, barely paying attention as James rambled on.He phased out for quite a bit, mind in the clouds, until finally coming back to reality. They all talked more about their summers. Remus talked a lot about being so sick. He wanted to tell them about the Flying Teeth incident but didn't want them to know exactly where he lived. He could easily see James showing up one day, 'hi I'm Remus's friend!'.Then the treat trolley came by. James pretty much bought everything, piling the sweets on both seats for all his friends to share in. The first thing they did was open up the Every Flavor Beans to dare each other. Peter had had good luck in their first year with choosing good flavors and this luck seemed to be continuing; Remus's luck was crap. Every single one he chose tasted awful. He complained so Peter chose one for him. James and Sirius leaned forward, anxious to see who's luck would win: Peter's good luck or Remus's bad?Remus put it in his mouth. "Are you kidding me?!" He spit it out into his hand, making a face. "I think, really, we both got it, though.""What?" Pete asked."It's technically a good flavor," Remus sighed, dropping the chewed bean into the bag he was dumping all his half-chewed beans into, "but I hate it. It's grapefruit. I don't like grapefruit." James and Sirius bust up laughing. Peter offered to try again but Remus shook his head. "I think it's quite clear Bertie Bott hates me.""Hates you specifically?" Sirius asked."Yes," Remus grumbled, pushing the box away and picking up a chocolate cauldron cake instead. "I'll stick with safety for now, thank you."After they filled their bellies with sweets, James wanted to go mess with the first years. The others trooped off while Remus volunteered to stay in the compartment to prevent anyone else from taking over. Once they left he pulled his feet up, getting a book out of his bag. The quiet felt good. He had forgotten the auditory problems of being around other kids, and would have to get used to it once more.A few minutes passed then someone tapped at the door. It was Lily, slipping in, saying she had seen his friends wandering around so she wanted to take the opportunity to see him. She sat next to him, avidly talking about the parts of her summer she hadn't mentioned in her letters. In return he showed her the beach photographs as well as shared some of James's sweets with her (he would just say he ate it, if James even noticed). They discussed at great length what their new Defense teacher might be like. He told her what Sirius had said he heard, about them being from the Ministry."A government employee?" Lily scrunched her face up. "I don't know a whole lot about the Ministry of Magic. What are they like?""I don't know," he said cautiously. "I've never really been around many." His father used to be one, but he didn't want to say that. "A good amount of magic folk wind up working for the Ministry, so I'd say they get all sorts. There's also loads of various departments. The new teacher could be from the sports division, or the creature division, or the potions' division. Probably from the law enforcement division, though, that'd be my guess.""A bobby?" Now she frowned."If I had to wager a guess, it's an auror," Remus mumbled, hoping he didn't sound too nervous. "They're pretty much the top fighters against dark arts. That's their living. There are other law enforcement employees who take care of more minor issues, however the aurors... they're the ones who deal with the dark arts." He shifted in his seat, feeling sick to his stomach. Worst case scenario would be someone from the W.C.U., however an auror was number two. Dumbledore surely wouldn't...!"Sev said it was probably an auror but he didn't explain what they were," Lily said, nodding absentmindedly. "He seemed to think I should already know..."Remus wanted to say 'of course he thinks that'. Instead he actually spoke on behalf of the slimy git by saying, "It can be hard for people who grew up immersed in this world to understand that others don't know stuff they've known for ages."Lily looked surprised. "You just defended—""I know! Please don't remind me, I might vomit." He clutched at his stomach to further prove his words while Lily giggled. "I didn't want to. Just... that unfortunately it's a common mindset."She leaned against him, then put her head on his shoulder. "I'm glad I have a friend like you. I mean, don't get me wrong, Sev's my best friend but—sometimes... it's difficult."He put his arm around her shoulders to comfort her but just then the door banged open and his friends came tumbling in, laughing. They all froze when they saw Lily, then began snickering."We interrupting something?" James asked, staring at Remus's arm.They pulled apart, Lily going brilliantly red. "Only an intelligent conversation which you couldn't understand anyway!" She stuck her nose up at him then looked at Remus. "I'll see you later." With that, she huffed out of the room. James stuck his tongue out after her then slammed the door shut behind her."What were you two doing?" Sirius inquired."Just talking," he replied awkwardly."With your arm around her?" Pete asked. Remus just shrugged, mumbling incoherently as a response."Romeo, Romeo," joked James.Remus sniffled loudly. "Considering the fact Romeo and Juliet A, were absolute idiots, and B, committed suicide, I really do not appreciate the comparison.""If I was with Evans I'd rather be dead too," James said, flinging himself into a seat, knocking sweets everywhere.Remus figured changing the conversation would be best before James went into a tirade about her. "So, did you suitably terrify the first years?""Indeed." Sirius began smirking. "We managed to convince several of them that in order to be Sorted you have to participate in a tournament duel.""Then we gave them suggestions on spells to practice," added Peter.Remus dropped his head, pressing his hands against his face, moaning loudly. "You—gave spells—to—first years?!""Yes!" James bounced in his seat. "We just left two trying out the jelly legs curse on each other.""Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?!" Remus demanded. "No!" he continued, not even letting them respond. "You don't!""Aw, they're just babies," Sirius said, flapping his hand, ignoring the fact they were only second years and therefore just one year older than the 'babies'. "They won't be able to do anything.""One of them might manage to accidentally do something awful!" Remus folded his arms, glaring at his friends. He should have gone with them. He should have known better than to have left them on their own for more than five seconds. "If they hurt themselves—or each other—McGonagall is going to be livid. You'll get into heaps of trouble for that.""Not our fault," James argued. "We merely told them some helpful spells. Not like we forced them to use them." He tapped the side of his nose knowingly.Remus just rubbed his forehead, figuring it'd be better to not argue with them over it. Besides, he didn't feel like lecturing, he was too busy still being happy that he was with them again. Though if they got into trouble over this he'd definitely say 'I told you so'."Speaking of dueling, who do you think our new Defense teacher might be?" Remus asked, wondering if any of them had heard anything which they hadn't. Pete had zero idea while Sirius repeated the rumors floating around the Black manor, which James confirmed. His father had said something about how strange it had been for Dumbledore to turn to the Ministry for an employee. "Why is it strange?" Remus asked."He's turned down the position of Minister twice now," James said with a shrug. "I don't think the Ministry's too keen on him. Especially Jenkins.""Why?"Sirius cocked his head to one side. "They wanted him for Minister instead of her. Same for Leach. Some people blame Dumbledore for why Leach became Minister but that's dragon dung."Remus tried to remember anything he knew about Leach, the previous Minister. "He... died, didn't he? Leach?""No, just got really sick with something nobody knows about," said James. "Whatever it is made him leave office."A chill went down Remus's spine. Something nobody knows about? Made him leave? His fingers began twisting into the hem of his shirt, heart pounding heavily. For some reason he couldn't help but wonder if that mean lycanthropy. There weren't many illnesses one would go to extreme measures to hide, nor make one leave office. "How did he g-get sick?" Remus whispered.None of his friends seemed to notice how weak Remus sounded. "Nobody knows," Sirius said which just made Remus get sicker. "Rumors say that the Malfoy family were involved but nobody knows for sure."Malfoys. He sort've recognized the name, having read it in the papers. One of the Sacred Twenty-Eight (like the Blacks). Rich. "Why?"James studied Remus. "Boy, you're in a curious mood today.""I j-just don't really know about this," he admitted."Wow, something we know about that you don't!" Sirius said with a grin.Remus rolled his eyes. "I really d-don't know much about the politics in the community. I want to know about this." I want to know if he was bitten by a werewolf, if he's... like me..."Leach was Muggleborn." It was Peter who spoke up and they all turned to him. "That's why.""Yeah, the first Muggleborn Minister of Magic ever," said James, scratching his head. "He faced a lot of hatred against him cause of that. People kept saying stuff. Like, there were also rumors he fixed some sort of Muggle sport so England would win, back in '66. But my dad says that's just people saying anything to undermime his authority—""Undermine," Remus corrected automatically."—er, right, undermine his authority. Anyway, in '68 he contracted the illness and then left his post," James finished."Nobody's really heard much about him since," said Sirius."What illness?" Remus asked, hoping he wasn't annoying his friends with all these questions. They didn't seem annoyed at least. Actually they seemed pleased to be able to explain things to him instead of the other way around."As we said before, nobody knows," James said in what he probably hoped was a spooky voice. "He never left the country or anything before catching it. He just suddenly got this illness, and quit. Then disappeared.""Then the Ministry wanted Dumbledore again but he said no," Sirius said. "Course that second time he had a better reason, it was when he had just become headmaster. So we have Jenkins. Who doesn't particularly like Dumbles cause they wanted him instead of her.""And now we're getting a Ministry worker as a teacher," put in James. "Which, in my personal opinion because of all this, is weird."Remus nodded in agreement then looked out the window, head whirling with all this information he found out. He barely even paid attention to politics today, let alone stuff that happened when he was a little kid. He wanted to find out more about Leach. Anything he could. Because even though it probably wasn't lycanthropy, it kind've sounded like it. Something mysterious nobody knows about, him disappearing... what else could it be?The rest of the train trip went by pretty quick. They played cards for a while, then James and Sirius left to do some pranks, then they tried playing a drawing game for a while which didn't go so well for Remus since he had James as a partner and James couldn't draw worth beans ("How can you not tell that's a cauldron?!" "It's SQUARE, James! Cauldrons aren't SQUARE!") and Sirius was an amazing artist which meant Peter guessed very easily, getting it right almost immediately every time. Eventually a Prefect came by to let them know they'd be arriving in Hogsmeade shortly, so James and Peter began changing into their uniforms, right there in the compartment. Even though he wouldn't need to take off any of his underthings, Remus still went to the bathroom to change so they wouldn't see his scar.They divided the sweets up (James refusing to take more than a fourth) then looked out the window as the train slowly came to a stop. The four boys left the train, leaving their bags which they knew would be magically taken to their dorms, starting to head towards the carriages however James and Sirius veered off to the enormous man calling for the first years."Hey Hagrid!" James said, waving."Hullo there, James! Sirius!" The groundskeeper of Hogwarts beamed at the two boys. Had a good summer?""Brilliant," James said. "We'll talk later?""Yeh kin come by my hut tomorrow fer some tea if yeh like," Hagrid said."Okay, see you tomorrow!" Sirius said then they went back towards the carriages. "Blimey, I'm happy we come back on a Friday. We should start on a Friday every year, always have a weekend first to get used to being back at school."Remus hesitated at the carriages, seeing the giant horse-dragon-skeleton things that pulled the carriages. All three of his friends just went to one of the carriages as if they couldn't see them; he was pretty sure he was the only person at Hogwarts that could see them except then who attached them to the carriages? Remus glanced back towards Hagrid. Maybe he could see him. He had suspected Hagrid might have giant's blood in him which would make him partially not human, so... perhaps...? Maybe I should ask?He climbed into the carriage after his friends, quiet the entire trip though none of them seemed to notice. Finally they arrived at the school. Stepping into Hogwarts felt like stepping into home, especially with his three friends around him even though they all snickered when he tripped over one of the stairs and would have gone sprawling if it wasn't for Sirius catching him by the back of the robes. They made jokes about how clumsy he was but it didn't bother him at all. He was just so happy to be back.

As soon as the Marauders went into the Great Hall all four sets of eyes went to the High Table, to get a glimpse of their new teacher. Except, there wasn't anyone new at all. In fact there were three empty seats, which confused the others until Remus pointed out that Hagrid was bringing the first years across the lake and McGonagall would be waiting for them."So where's the new Defense teacher?" Sirius asked as they found seats."Maybe we don't have one," suggested Peter.Remus shook his head. "We have new Defense books on the list. We must have a new teacher." He switched his focus to the Gryffindor table, looking for Lily. She was sitting several seats down with her two female friends—Alice Colgate, a pale girl with very curly hair, and Cassandra Inkwood, a black girl whose hair poofed out in an afro. Inkwood looked really different though Remus couldn't quite figure out why."Bloody hell!" Sirius hissed out, following Remus's gaze. He began smacking James's arm rather violently. "Look at her. Look at her."James's jaw dropped a little. "Jumping jarveys.""Holy hippogriffs," Peter agreed.Remus didn't know which girl they were staring at though all three—sensing the stares—turned to look. Immediately James and Peter looked away however Sirius just flashed a grin, giving them a salute and a wink. All three girls turned their heads away, clearly irritated. Remus wanted to ask what that had been about however as James and Peter seemed to immediately know whatever grabbed Sirius's attention and Remus did not, he didn't want to appear stupid."Oh drat. Spinnet made it back," sighed Sirius as he looked past the girls and saw the other two second year boys; Morrander Spinnet and David Struthers. Remus liked Struthers well enough. He was a decent guy. Spinnet, however, had quickly become not only his enemy but the enemy of all the Marauders. He particularly hated Sirius."Snivellus is back too," said James, eyeing the Slytherin table. Snape was looking at the Gryffindor table though not at them but at Lily.Sirius snapped his fingers. "You'd expect him to drown in his own hair grease or something.""Urgh, I just hope the feast starts soon." Peter rubbed his stomach miserably."Even after all those sweets?" James teased. Peter kicked him."It'll start soon," Remus said, hearing vague chattering from outside the Great Hall doors belonging to the first years. The doors swung open, and McGonagall led the children down the middle aisle."Man, they're little," James said. "One or two might even be shorter than you, Remus." Now Remus kicked him though he did notice he wasn't bigger than the first years at all.Sirius was watching his brother. Regulus kept his face forward, on McGonagall and the Sorting Hat which began singing its new song; Remus barely paid attention to the words since his mind was more on the whole missing teacher thing. Everyone applauded when the song finished except for most the first years who merely looked frightened (and a couple who were looking around with annoyed looks, Remus thought probably the ones who had believed his friends about a duel).Regulus was the fourth one called. The Slytherins were all murmuring and giving Sirius looks as Regulus walked forward, chin held high. Sirius just watched his brother, whispering under his breath. "Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin. Come on, Reg, you can do it." His hands were curled into fists so tight his knuckles were white. Remus wanted to reach out and comfort him somehow but kept his hands to himself.Regulus sat down. The Hat was put on his head. Sirius held his breath, staring so intensely that Remus thought a fire might spark. The Hat opened its brim and..."SLYTHERIN!"The Slytherin table exploded with applause. Remus distinctly heard several variations of 'That's where a true Black belongs'. It seemed half the table got up to shake Regulus's hand as he went to find his seat, looking very pleased with himself."Damn it," Sirius growled out, eyes still on his brother. Regulus looked over, his expression reading more concerned than anything else as he took a seat among the Slytherins. Sirius slammed his hand against the table, swearing again."It'll be okay," James said, touching Sirius's arm.He yanked himself away from James. "You don't know Reg. Slytherin's going to destroy him. I know it will. He's..." Sirius trailed off, voice fading. "He's too trusting.""That... doesn't sound like a bad thing...?" Peter asked, confused.Sirius shook his head miserably. "He believes in what our parents say, what Slytherins try to uphold. Purity, tradition, all that crap. He's just going to end up like the rest of them. I thought if he was somewhere else maybe I could..." He stopped again then remained quiet, looking quite depressed.Finally Alpretha Whitespring was put into Ravenclaw, finishing the Sorting off. Then Professor Dumbledore stood up, announcing the start of the feast. No mention of the missing Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Food appeared across the tables and everyone began eating. Remus just continued staring at the High Table until James nudged him, asking if he was all right since he seemed so out of it."He didn't say anything about a Defense teacher," Remus said as he began getting food, not really noticing what he put on his plate. "Isn't it strange?"Pete said something with his mouth full of food making his words incomprehensible until he swallowed and repeated, "Told you, we don't have one.""We have to have one," James said, stuffing chicken into his mouth. "Dumbles wouldn't just not. Remy, why are you eating vinegar on fruit?"Remus froze with the fork halfway to his mouth then set it down. "I wasn't really paying attention to what I put on my plate.""Might be interesting," Sirius said, reaching over to stab a bit of fruit then popped it in his mouth. "Urgh. No. Not good."Remus surveyed his plate. Vinegar had gotten on everything, which surprised him that he hadn't noticed the smell. He pushed his plate away and used a bowl to eat from. "Guess this doesn't help my loopy reputation," he mumbled, wondering if that nickname would persist."Not really," James said.Remus glared. "You weren't supposed to agree!""Oblivious," Sirius said."Absentminded?" Peter added.James pointed his fork at Remus. "Preoccupied. The Preoccupied Potions Professor.""Ooh, I love that comic!" Peter said cheerfully."I am not oblivious, absentminded, or preoccupied!" Remus complained bitterly."You put grapefruit on your plate," Sirius said, waving his hand at Remus's abandoned meal. "Didn't you say you hate it this afternoon?"Remus just scowled, poking at the food in the bowl. "Oh, shut up. I was... distracted. A little.""Yeah, only a little," Sirius said, smirking. "When you're distracted a lot you tend to run into walls.""I hate you." Then when all three of his friends laughed he added, "All of you." Sirius just tousled Remus's hair.The conversation turned to other matters, eventually leading into Quidditch. James got up, heading down the table to talk to a fifth year girl who made room for him to sit down. They talked animatedly for a while, a burly boy sitting by them patting James on the back. Then James back back, a bounce in his step."Bell was made Captain," he explained as he sat down, referring to Patricia Bell, a Chaser on the Quidditch team. "She says tryouts won't be too far away, she wants to get the team going as soon as possible." He was practically vibrating with excitement. "Oh man, I can't wait. James Potter: Gryffindor Chaser!" He spread his hands out for emphasis. "Are you going to try out?"Sirius shrugged. "Probably not. There's only room for a Chaser and a Keeper, isn't there? You'll get the Chaser position and I don't like being Keeper.""You could be a reserve," James pointed out. "Always need those.""I wish I was good at Quidditch," sighed Peter. "I'd love to play, even as a reserve."James poked him. "You should try out too!"Peter's eyes got wide. "Me? Everybody'd just laugh at me.""I wouldn't," James said loftily. "I'd hex anyone who laughed at you, too.""Brilliant way to get on the team, mate," Sirius laughed. "Hexing people at tryouts."James stuck his tongue out. "I wouldn't at tryouts, dummy. After. Anyway, Bell says she's gonna try to get the pitch booked for next Saturday. One week. That's it. Oh man. Oh boy. Remy, you'll be coming to tryouts too, won't you?" Remus nodded, unable to talk since he just took a big bite of potatoes. "Okay good. I need all of you there. It'll make me better.""We'll be your cheering quad," Pete promised.Sirius punched James's arm lightly. "Not that you need it. You might as well already be officially on the team."James beamed brighter than all the floating candles combined.After dessert Professor Dumbledore stood up so he could tell everyone a few rules. He reminded that the Forbidden Forest was named so because it was Forbidden (he glanced towards the Marauders at this making Remus wonder if he somehow knew about their fort they had been building last term in the forest), Quidditch tryouts would be the second week ("And we'll have the first," James muttered), that there's a list of rules posted in each common room which were now updated with new rules (again looking at the Marauders, making James and Sirius both grin)."As some of you may have noticed, we have an empty seat up here," Dumbledore said which caused some whispering. "Your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher has been held up a little. He'll be here Sunday. Now, let's have a nice rendition of our school song then everyone can go to bed!"Words appeared in the air, the lyrics to Hogwarts' song. Everyone began singing to their own desired tune. James and Sirius shrieked them out to popular rock tunes, standing on their seats to be as noticeable as possible. Remus just mumbled so quietly nobody could hear him. Once everyone was finished, they all got up to shuffle slowly out of the Great Hall. It was especially crowded just outside the doors since prefects were trying to gather first years to show them the way to the common room."Come on," James said, shuffling along the wall, away from the stairs. The rest followed him down a side corridor and into a secret passageway that took them to the next floor up, where they could get back to the main passages and up to their tower without issue. They were the first ones there which gave Sirius the idea to string up some spiderweb spells. Remus was tired but helped James and Sirius while Peter stayed close to the slightly open entrance, to keep an ear out (which should have been Remus but he didn't want them to know how well he could hear). They only strung up single threads that could hardly be seen, crisscrossing them all over the common room."People coming!" Peter squeaked, shutting the painting. Remus helped guide him through their webbing then all four hurried up to their dorm, giggling. They left their door open so they could hear the shouts and protests from other students being caught in the webbing."We should hide out in the bathroom, so Spinnet doesn't see we're already here," Remus suggested, so the four of them hurried across the hall into the bathroom. They waited a good ten minutes (chattering quietly) until finally they heard their dorm door shut, waited a few more minutes, then returned to their dorm.Struthers and Spinnet were busy picking bits of web off themselves. Spinnet glowered as soon as the door opened. "Where were you? Probably hiding somewhere in the common room to enjoy your handiwork, eh?""We just got here," Sirius said."Yeah, sure." Spinnet pulled his robes off, throwing them into his laundry bin. "Everyone knows you did that.""The sticky threads in the common room?" James shook his head. "They were there when we came in.""Andy, just leave it," sighed Struthers.Spinnet was definitely not leaving it. "You can't even go one evening without causing chaos! You know, you two are why I dreaded coming back!"James put on his best Potter smile. "Glad we've left such a lasting impression!"Spinnet's lip curled and his hand jerked towards his pocket. He stopped, then spun away from them to change into his pajamas. Struthers cast them a rather exasperated look. "It's the first night back, can't you just..." He stopped, shaking his head and retreating to gather his stuff so he could go change.Like on the train, Remus went to the bathroom to change. When he returned he found his friends sitting on James's bed, motioning for him to join. "The spells are still strong," James said as he shut his curtains. "So they can't hear everything if we're really quiet.""D'you think you still need the spells?" Sirius inquired.Remus looked down at his lap. "N—not sure. Probably."Due to his problem with nightmares... or, rather, his tendency to wake up literally screaming from his nightmares, Professor Flitwick had placed sound absorbing spells on all their beds the previous year. Well, except Sirius who insisted on being able to hear Remus so he could go to him if Remus needed him."I wish we didn't have to share with him," grumbled Sirius, glaring at the curtains. "Spinnet's such a twat.""So our new Defense teacher is a guy?" Peter asked, not paying attention to Sirius at all which, in the circumstance, was the best choice."Apparently." James rubbed his chin. "Held up by what though?""If he works for the Ministry, maybe something with them?" Peter offered."Guess we'll find out more Sunday," James said, leaning back against his headboard. "It's probably just all stuff to make us more interested in him, like... build up the mystery."They talked for a while, accidentally getting louder until Spinnet told them to shut up; at that point it was fairly late, but they didn't have class in the morning so they just gathered cards, sweets, James's record player, and headed down to the empty common room. There weren't any cobwebs left, so someone had gotten rid of them. Remus figured they were probably in the clear since no prefect had sought them out.They settled down near the fireplace, Sirius popping a record on while James shuffled the cards. They played Jarvey for a bit then they played the Muggle version of Jarvey which was called Cheat, that Peter taught them. It was pretty much the same but since they used Muggle cards the cards couldn't speak to trick the other players (or call Jarvey on the person who set the card down). It was really weird, but fun in its own way. They were laughing a lot, being louder than they intended as someone did come down the stairs to complain about the fact their laughter could be heard up in the dorms."Sorry," James said, flashing his Potter grin. "We'll quiet down.""It's after midnight," the boy complained. "You should go to sleep."Remus glanced up, unable to hold back the snark. "Your suggestion has been taken into consideration, thank you."The other Marauders snorted with laughter while the older boy scowled so deeply that Sirius told him, "Careful, your face will stick like that.""I never!" The boy spun around and stormed back up.They all dissolved into giggles. "Your suggestion has been taken into consideration!" James said, pounding the table with his fist. "Brilliant.""We should use that next time McGonsie gives us detention," said Sirius."Merlin, can you imagine her face?!" James shrieked and they all began laughing again which just resulted in one of the girls coming down the stairs to tell them to be quiet. This time they tried their best; Sirius even turned down the volume of the record player. They stayed up for another hour at least before finally being too tired to continue on."Oh, before we go to bed I want to show you something," James said in a way-too-casual voice. "Wait down here. I'll be right back." He dashed up the stairs."Wonder what that's about," yawned Peter as he gathered the cards up."Hopefully it doesn't take long," Sirius said, leaning against the back of a couch. Remus perched on the back of the couch and Peter waited next to him.A moment later Remus heard faint footsteps coming down the stairs. "Okay face the other way, count to ten, then turn around," James instructed. "Count slowly."Sirius and Peter turned, Remus just covered his face, not feeling like getting off the couch. Sirius did the counting. As he did Remus could hear James come back into the common room. At ten the others turned back around and Remus lowered his hands... but James wasn't there."Come on, James, hurry up," Sirius called towards the stairs.Remus blinked, tilting his head. He heard James come into the common room. He could... sense James there, somewhere. Very, very faint breathing. Hardly audible. Muffled by something. Remus's heart began going a little faster as the hairs on the back of his neck rose up. Something wasn't right. The wolf didn't like this at all."James, it's one-thirty," Peter complained.Sirius threw his hands in the air. "Git," he grumbled."Oi!" Suddenly James's head appeared. "Git?"All three of the Marauders yelped in fear, jumping. Peter even grabbed at Remus's arm who nearly fell backwards off the sofa back. James's head began laughing. "Your faces! Perfect! More than PERFECT!""You got it?!" Sirius ran over so quickly one of his slippers became loose nearly tripping him.James's body appeared as he pulled a strange cloak off of him. Remus and Peter cautiously approached. "Yes!" James hopped from foot to foot. "He gave it to me last night, said he thought it was time. I was mature enough. Puhhhlease, I was mature enough last year!""Is that an invisibility cloak?" Remus asked, eyes huge."It sure is, my brainy little friend!" James held the cloak up then wrapped it around himself so once more he was a floating head. "It's been handed down in my family for generations! I should have gotten it for my first year 'cept for some reason Dad thought he should wait."Peter reached out, hand pressing against thin air. "You're still there.""Yeah it just makes me invisible, it doesn't make me... ummm... not solid.""Incorporeal," Remus muttered automatically. "But that doesn't make sense.""Huh? Yeah it does, why would being invisible make me go through walls?" James asked as he took the cloak back off, handing it over to Sirius who looked just about ready to pass out from bliss. He put the cloak on the same way so he was just a floating head, spinning in circles.Remus shook his head. "No, not that. The handed-down bit. Invisibility cloaks don't last that long. They barely last one generation. Spells wear off. They become visible. Or rip. Or—something. May I see it?"Sirius took it off but Remus didn't put it on, he just held it in his hands, feeling a shiver go through his body. His fingers slid against the silky fabric as he inspected it closely, turning it about in his hands."If you're just gonna gawp at it give it back, I want to wear it again," Sirius complained.Remus sighed, handing it back. This time all three of his friends disappeared under it. "It doesn't make sense," Remus said again."Shut up and get under here, let's see if we all fit," said James's voice as he lifted the edge.Remus went under the cloak, finding it uncomfortable the second he stepped in. They were crowded against each other though the cloak covered all of them. At least, until James began jumping up and down making joyful shrieks almost right in Remus's ear."WE'RE GONNA DO SO MUCH WITH THIS!" he shouted then began laughing."Someone's coming," Remus said.James hesitated then smiled. "Well, nobody's here," he whispered, returning to their side so they were all hidden.A girl came down the stairs, mouth open to complain. She peered around the room with narrowed eyes, pressed her lips then, then stomped back up the steps."She didn't see us at all!" Peter squeaked."Course not," James said. "We are invisible!"Remus ducked out from under the cloak since he was starting to get too warm. His stomach twisted when he turned around to see thin air but smelling all of his friends there, sensing them. The wolf began clawing at his brain miserably. Thankfully James yanked the cloak back, revealing all of them once more."This is going to be incredible," he said, folding the cloak up. "We are going to cause so much trouble!""Good thing you're 'mature' enough to handle the responsibility," laughed Sirius as they headed back up to their dorm.Remus was still thinking about how strange it was the cloak was in such beautiful condition after being 'handed down' through generations. Unless Mr. Potter lied to him and merely bought him a brand new cloak. That was a possibility. After settling on that idea, Remus finally drifted into sleep.

Author's Note: I forget to say this in the last chapter I'm sorry! I got a question about James not being able to see thestrals from a guest account. First off thank you for the comment and second of all, good observation! Yes, James saw his grandfather die. However from what I understand seeing someone die isn't the only variable in seeing thestrals, you must also have accepted it. I'm pretty sure that is the reason Harry didn't see the thestrals at the end of his fourth year. So while James saw his grandfather die, he hasn't really quite 'come to terms' with it yet. He'll be able to see them before too long. Thank you so much for the question and I hope that helps!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus didn't sleep too well his first night back at Hogwarts. He didn't really have nightmares however he tossed and turned a lot, waking up several times. Finally he dragged Gwyllgi out of his trunk and curled up, hugging his dog against him, sleeping decently for the rest of the night. He woke up when the others were waking up, hearing their voices, hearing one of his friends say to wake him. He shoved Gwyllgi under his pillow just as his curtains opened. He sat upright, rubbing his eyes."Morning," Sirius said in a strange voice."Morning," Remus replied, sliding out of bed, wondering what was going on since Sirius's heart rate was faster than normal. A big prank planned? "What time?""Nearly ten," James said from where he was getting dressed. "We've missed breakfast.""We can get something from the kitchens though," said Peter."Then outside," James said quickly, sitting down to tie his trainers. "It's a nice day out so we're gonna have some broom time!"After all four of them got dressed in casual weekend clothes (with James hauling his carrying case) they trooped to the kitchens. Remus and Peter greeted the house-elves while James and Sirius got a large basket full of food. They ate next to the lake, sitting in the bright sunshine, occasionally tossing bits of food into the lake for the giant squid. Remus wasn't too hungry so he wound up laying on his belly with a book in front of him though he wasn't reading. It felt so good just relaxing like this, being with them again. All too soon they were done eating, brushing crumbs and grass off their clothes as James unlatched the broom case."Lads and—er, other lads. Behold!" He flicked the lid open, flourishing his hands proudly."Blimey!" Sirius looked in with big eyes. "Jimmy, it's beautiful!"Remus was frozen on the ground. His bones were aching slightly, his skin crawling. He didn't dare move. Didn't dare even look."It's amazing, one of the top brooms ever." James pulled the broom out, putting it in Sirius's hands. "It can reach a hundred miles an hour in fifteen seconds!""That's how I fell, James convinced me to accelerate real fast," said Peter.Sirius turned so Remus could look at it. "Yeah it's, uh, quite a broom," Remus said, sitting up cross-legged as an excuse to edge a little farther away. The handle was chestnut, the twigs some kind of pine which gave off a lovely scent. However... the metal binding the twigs to the handle as well as the metal stating the name along the handle, and the metal in bands along the top of the handle were most assuredly silver. Real silver, not just looks-like-silver."Sirius, give it a try," James said.Sirius grinned and mounted the broom, fingers closing around the handle, fingers touching the silver StarShooter900 label. He kicked off, zipping up into the sky, shouting gleefully. James and Peter cheered him on as he began looping and rolling through the air. Remus gave polite claps, feeling super ill. At least they all knew he disliked flying so he had a ready excuse not to try it. Still, it was awful.Sirius landed with a fancy sort of bounce. "James, James, it's perfect!""Isn't it?" James ran over, taking his broom back, caressing the handle lovingly. "They're completely sold out. Or were over the summer. But Dad knows the owner of the company so that's how I got it. Remus, your turn!""No thank you," Remus whispered, scooting away as James came closer. "I don't like flying." He fought hard to keep his voice steady as the silver was so close to him. He had no idea what silver did exactly to him, just that he could physically feel it when he was close and that it did something very bad; he was pretty sure it would burn him since that's how his skin felt when it got close. That sort've burning prickling sensation. Besides, it was the only way to actually kill a werewolf. Silver blades, that sort of thing. He didn't think the silver on the broom would kill him... unless maybe someone clobbered him over the head with it. Would that work? Or did the silver have to go in him? Most werewolves were executed via silver ax chopping the head off. He wondered about a silver club...Then he wondered why he was even wondering about this. Especially with James taking another step.Remus sprang to his feet, wiping sweaty palms against his ancient jeans. "No. Really, I—I'm all right.""I can take you," James offered. "You can sit behind me.""Or I can take you, if you're worried about James being too flashy on the broom," Sirius said."You don't want me taking you," put in Peter. "I can barely fly myself."Remus tried not to look at the broom, at the silver. "I'm fine. Th-thank you though. You fly. I want to see you fly."James frowned, brow furrowing rather deeply. "If you're afraid of me flying I'll be careful, or Sirius can take you. Oh, go on. Try it. It's nothing like those stupid school brooms." He held the broom out so closely that Remus jumped back without even thinking. "It's not going to bite."All of them looked surprised at his reaction. Not normal, he realized, wanting to pull the collar of his shirt up around his mouth. This isn't normal, most kids would leap at this chance. "I—I—" He didn't know what to say. How to get out of this. "I'd rather watch you fly, really.""Remy, you can't be afraid of flying your whole life," said Sirius, folding his arms. "How are you gonna get around?""There's this fancy little magic called Apparition," Remus replied rather grouchily. "Once I turn seventeen I can learn and who needs brooms? I won't ever play Quidditch.""Learning to fly is an important part of a wizard's... errr..." James trailed off, squinting in thought. "That a wizard can do.""It's not that scary," Peter said."I've learned to fly," he pointed out, feeling as though something was scraping against his skin. He had this sensation several times before, when he was getting overwhelmed. When things were too much. First day back, and he was already feeling like this. Not a good sign. It didn't help with the silver pulsating into his very being as James started towards him again.Peter had been watching Remus with a frown, eyes going between him and James. Now he took a few steps towards them. "Um, well, if he doesn't want to try the broom, you can't make him." Remus felt so grateful, resisting the urge to run over to hide behind Pete.James tilted his head, eyes on Remus and he had a feeling he knew what James was thinking even without Legilimency: Why is he acting like this? or something similar. "Okay," he finally said. "If you're sure...""I'm sure," Remus said quickly.James gave him another puzzled look then offered the broom to Pete who gladly got on it, flying around for a while (though closer to the ground than Sirius had). Remus sat back down on the ground, trying his hardest to keep his breathing even. He wrapped his shaky hands around his knees, holding tightly so it wouldn't be noticeable. Sirius and James sat on either side of him as they watched Peter, cheering him on. Remus hugged his knees harder. Why did James have to get a broom with silver on it? Why did anyone put silver on a broom?Remus excused himself, telling them he needed to go to the bathroom. He hurried to the castle, to one of the closest bathrooms he could find; thankfully it was empty. He shut the door then turned around, leaning against it, letting a moan of frustration out. He banged the back of his head against the door a couple times then slid down to the floor. He felt so stupid, allowing this to get to him so much. His fingers twitched, scratching at his wrists since he still felt that scraping feeling. He knew scratching wouldn't stop it but he couldn't help it. His nails were so stubby, though, he barely left any marks and any he left healed immediately.Someone tried opening the door. Remus pressed back. "S—sorry, had a spell problem, try a d-d-different one!" he called out, digging his shoes against the floor for added strength."Remus?""Sirius?""Can I come in? What do you mean spell problem? Merlin, what did you do?""I-I'm busy..."He tried opening the door again, pushing. "It's a public bathroom!" he grunted. "Let me in." Remus bit his bottom lip so hard he drew blood then he moved away from the door. It flung open, slamming hard against the wall. Sirius fell in, stumbling as he tried to regain balance then tripping over Remus who whispered an apology as Sirius hit the floor. He twisted around, sitting up. "What's going on?" he asked, kicking at the door to shut it. Remus moved back against it so nobody else could get in."I feel sick to my stomach," he lied. "Dizzy, too."Sirius brushed his hair from his face, adjusting his position so he was on his knees now, leaning in to study Remus's face. Remus pressed back, trying to keep distance. "You need to see Pomfrey already? But—" Sirius stopped himself. Remus wondered what the 'but' was for."N-no, I'll be fine," he said, pulling his knees up, pulling his shirt up so the collar was around his mouth. "I threw up. Feeling better now."Sirius glanced at the stalls then back to Remus. "Is that why you didn't want to fly?"Brilliant! Remus tried not to let the excitement show. "Um. Y... yeah... I didn't want you guys to know I wasn't feeling well.""Idiot." Now Sirius sat next to him, back against the door as well. "You're an idiot.""I guess." Both their legs were stretched out. Remus's sneakers were old, worn out, a hole in one side. Sirius's were brand new. His jeans were brand new too; Remus's were worn out, old, still a little too big for him. They'd probably be too battered before he grew into them."You don't have to keep things from us," Sirius said which sent a chill down his spine. "Do you need to go lay down?""Nah, I'll be all right. Did... you need to go to the bathroom?""No, I came to check on you.""Oh. Th—thanks. You d-didn't need to..."Sirius rapped his knuckles lightly against the top of Remus's head. "Idiot," he said again then got up. "Take as long as you need."He left the bathroom, Remus returning to pressing against the door. He put his face in his hands, trying to take in deep, calming breaths. He also tried emptying his mind. Like he did for Occlumency. Emptying himself of thoughts and emotions, letting them drain away... which he was not very good at. He had too much anxiety for that. Sometimes he wondered if the only things inside of him were a wolf and anxiety. It sure felt that way.After a few moments he got up, going to the sink to splash some cold water against his face. He was feeling better now, a bit calmer. You'll be okay, he told himself as he went to the door. He started to open it but then stopped, hearing voices out in the hall. Ones he unfortunately recognized. Oh, crap! He backed away from the door then bolted into one of the stalls as the door to the bathroom opened. He locked the stall door then got on the toilet, pulling his feet up, panic pounding in his brain."—crop of first years look interesting," said an oily sort of voice that Remus knew belong to Avery of Slytherin, one of the meanest bullies in their year."There's a few we should keep our eye on," agreed a thicker, heavier sort of voice that belonged to Mulciber of Slytherin, one of the other meanest bullies.They went into two of the other stalls, discussing the first years. Remus considered making a run for it however as he reached towards the door to unlock it they began talking about Regulus."Least he's a proper Black," said Avery. "Not a disgrace like that disgusting brother of his.""We definitely need to keep an eye on him," said Mulciber. "Make sure it's clear where his loyalties lie."They talked for another minute or so before flushing the toilets then leaving without washing their hands. Remus counted to twenty slowly then left the bathroom, running outside as fast as he could (tripping a couple times). His friends were where he had left them, James on the broom now. Sirius and Peter smiled when they saw him though the smiles faded when Remus breathlessly told Sirius what he had heard."Going after Reg?" Fury flashed through Sirius's eyes. "Oooh, if they do anything to him they're going to regret it.""It sounds more like they want him on their side," Peter said. "Um, by the way, are you feeling better? Sirius said you were sick?""I'm doing a bit better yeah, thank you."Sirius began pacing around furiously. "Their side is awful, and if they try to befriend him they're going to regret it." He stopped then snapped his fingers cheerfully. "You know, with James's cloak we can easily find the Slytherin's password. Break in, do stuff to their dorm. And Snape's.""Don't do anything to the entire dorm room though," Remus said quickly. Sirius gave him a suspicious look, demanding to know why. "Because he shares with Silverlocke, and Silverlocke's my..." He trailed off, trying to think of a good term. "I suppose... study buddy?" He sort of wanted to call him his friend however he doubted they were on good enough terms for that. He liked Aegis Silverlocke, the only Slytherin of the study group Lily had put together the previous year. He was very nice."You know their dorm layout?" Pete asked in surprise."I know who shares with whom," Remus replied. "Silverlocke told me. It's him, Snape, Wicket, and Fox in one, then Mulciber, Avery, and Bulstrode in the other.""The three bullies in one," snorted Sirius. "I shouldn't be surprised.""HEY!" James landed, looking rather annoyed. "You guys weren't watching me! I just did the most terrific of loops—oh, Siri, what's wrong?""Don't call me that," Sirius snapped. "And what's wrong is Mulciber and Avery want to try to get Reg on their side, in their little stupid group. Plus I realized we can find out the Slytherin's password with your cloak."James's jaw dropped. "Holy hippogriffs you're right, we can! We're totally doing that later tonight. Oh. Remus. Are you all right? Feeling any better?""Yeah, a bit," he said. "I'm sorry for lying. Or, um, for hiding. How I was feeling."James clasped him on the shoulder. "It's all right. I know you're really touchy about that sort of stuff."After the other three flew around on the broom a bit more they all decided to sneak into the Forbidden Forest to see how their fort was doing. They went in their usual way however the trail they used to use didn't take them directly to the area, it somehow shifted over summer. So it took them a while of wandering around before finally finding the large rock shaped like a sleeping dragon, with four crudely made stick walls set up nearby, still in good condition. They played there for a while, mostly James, Sirius, and Peter seeing who could jump the farthest off of Dragon Rock while Remus sat nearby watching. He wanted to jump too, but had to pretend he wasn't feeling well which he regretted. He should have just sucked it up and tried the broom. He did run around with them a bit, tripping a few times getting quite muddy in the process.After that they headed back to the main grounds, forging a new path through the woods. Remus thought it was strange the old path had grown over in just one summer. It didn't seem possible... though the forest was strange. Maybe this sort of thing was normal for the Forbidden Forest? It wasn't as if they could just ask anyone otherwise that'd be pretty much confessing to going where they weren't supposed to.Sirius and James were going to go to tea at Hagrid's, inviting Remus and Peter along, insisting Hagrid wouldn't mind. It didn't appear as if he did; the groundskeeper boomed out a happy greeting to all four boys, letting them into his hut. His enormous wolfhound bounded around them, going straight for Remus. Rocky stuck his scruffy face into Remus's and began licking exuberantly, wagging his tail so hard it beat against Peter's body. Remus had to shuffle along the edge of the wall to reach one of the seats, sliding back so far into Hagrid's chair his legs stuck straight out. Rocky jumped up into the chair with him, taking up more space than him, resting his head against Remus's chest."Looks like you made a new best friend," Sirius said as he, James, and Pete sat in smaller chairs around the table.Rocky licked Remus's chin so Remus began scratching him behind the ears. The tail began thwumping again. Hagrid passed around tea as well as very hard biscuits. Remus covertly tapped his against the wooden armrest then, seeing how it was like stone, stuck it into his tea to soften. He stayed hidden behind Rocky for almost the entire visit while Hagrid, James, and Sirius spoke enthusiastically about wild creatures Hagrid knew about and Peter listened in. Hagrid spoke a lot about being in the forest as well as some of the things he had found in there while James and Sirius listened with wide eyes and blissful smiles./\/\/\/\/\"There you are!" Lily practically tackled Remus as soon as the four of them went into the Common Room then crinkled her nose when she noticed all the mud on him, though didn't mention it. "I have been looking for you all day! Where have you been? Never mind," she said before he could say anything, glancing towards the other Marauders. "I'd probably be better off not knowing. Anyway, Frobisher asked me to give you these.""Who?" Remus asked as she pawed around in her school satchel."Charon Frobisher?" Lily pulled out four thick pieces of parchment, handing them to him. "Prefect."It was their new schedule for the year. James, Sirius, and Pete all crowded around him as they looked over how their year would be going. Remus gave them each a copy so they'd stop breathing down his neck. "Ugh, we have Potions twice a week now?!" Sirius complained immediately. "We have to see Slytherins more?" Lily glared at him though remained silent."Hey on Wednesdays we can sleep in," Peter said excitedly.James adjusted his glasses as he examined the schedule closely. "Wow, Mondays and Fridays are busy. Four classes.""Only going to be busier next year, when we take our electives," pointed out Lily with a sniff."I almost forgot about those," Sirius admitted."Just let me know what you two take, so I can avoid those classes!" Lily told James and Sirius."There aren't teacher names on here," Remus noted.Sirius gave Remus a strange look. "We kinda know all their names by now?"Remus just shook his head, folding the parchment up carefully. "Not Defense. I suppose we'll find out very soon. I was just really curious."Lily nudged him. "By the way, I spoke to Craft earlier today. He's keen on starting up study group again however I think we should cut back to three times a week instead of every night, especially since our curfew is eight now, so that would give us six hours a week, if we do two hours which seems a bit much though I suppose we don't need to... well, either way, Florence, Kyra, and Bones agree. I haven't spoke to Silverlocke yet though. Twycross thinks we should meet every night but... most of us didn't make us every night anyway. What do you think?""Me?" Remus asked."No, Pettigrew," Lily said, putting her hands on her hips. "Yes you.""Oh. Er. W—well...""Cause you have to see Madame Pomfrey once a week anyway, right?" Lily asked, this time in a softer voice.Remus nodded slowly. The lie he had used to explain his whereabouts when he disappeared for Occlumency lessons, insisting that Pomfrey needed to give him a check up once a week due to his illness. "I'm not sure which evening works best for—er, I mean, when I'll be going to see her. I haven't spoke to her yet. I'll let you know when I do. But... I think perhaps three times a week would be good, or four, even, we can meet extra on the weekends or something.""I agree with that idea. All right, I'll see what the others think. D'you want to talk to Silverlocke?""I can, yeah," he agreed.Lily beamed. "I was thinking maybe meeting tomorrow after lunch to go over summer's homework?""Merlin, you are so boring," James complained.Sirius folded his arms. "It's the weekend! Who wants to do homework?"Remus turned to look at him. "Don't you still have homework to do?"Sirius glowered at him. "...maybe," he grunted."You haven't done some of your homework from the summer?" Lily's eyes widened. "How stupid are you?"His eyes flashed angrily. "I'm not stupid. Homework is just boring.""I second that," James said. "Actually doing stuff is fun. The written parts? No thanks." He got his wand out and began flourishing it without using any spells. "Man, I can't wait to get into dueling, if that's what our new Defense is meaning with that book. Oh! Hey Evans, wanna see my new broom?" He immediately began opening his carrying case. As soon as he took it out several students ran over, gasping in admiration as James showed the StarShooter900 off. Even Lily looked a little impressed."You know what kind of broom that is?" Sirius asked."Of course I do!" she replied haughtily. "Just because I enjoy studying doesn't mean I don't like Quidditch.""Remus doesn't like Quidditch," Peter said."Wow, it's almost as if Remus and I aren't the same person," Lily said, causing Remus to snort with laughter until he noticed Peter flushing with embarrassment. Lily must have realized too, as she went on to say, "Though, I can understand that line of thinking." He still looked embarrassed but not quite as much. "What an absolute idiot."Remus was about to defend Pete then realized she was talking about James who had gotten on his broom in the middle of the common room, hovering a foot off the ground. "James, that's not a—a good idea," Remus tried."It's fine," James said, inching a little bit higher. The students around him applauded as if he had done some great trick. They were all talking about the StarShooter, excited to see one in person. James's chest puffed out as he answered questions, casually mentioning the fact they had gotten it from the MidnightFlight owner himself. He rose a little more so the broom was somewhat eye level for most the crowd."POTTER!" An older student pushed through the knot to stand in front of James, fury filling his face. "Get off that broom right now, you're not allowed to ride inside the castle!""Says who?" James bent way forward on his broom, folding his arms across the handle so he could casually rest his chin on his arms. It was quite the spectacle since it meant a great deal of ability to lean forward without making the broom go forward. He was really showing off. Judging by the expressions on everyone's faces it was working. Except for the Prefect."Says the rules!" The Prefect eyed him critically. "Which you are supposed to have read!"Everyone waited to see what would happen next. James straightened up, did a quick loop-de-loop, then landed. "My apologies," he said rather dramatically. "Won't happen again.""Two points from Gryffindor," the Prefect snapped before storming off. James just gave the watching students a wink before putting his broom away, feeding off all the attention."Such an idiot," Lily muttered under her breath.

Author's Note: I got asked a question about my replies to comments. I assume when I send a reply it goes to the person's PM inbox (as it says "note: Private Messages are delivered both to the e-mail and PM inbox"). However I never get e-mails about PMs sent my way so I don't know about the e-mails.

Anyway, I'm still pretty new to FFN so that's about all I know :S/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\That night the Marauders stayed up till midnight before going to bed, but an hour later Remus was torn from his dreams by Sirius shaking him awake. "Wanna be lookout for us again?" he asked. "Jimmy and I are gonna explore.""Oh, su-uuuu-ure," Remus yawned, slithering out of bed to pull on his robe and slippers. He grabbed a book, took James's fancy watch, then followed his friends down to the common room."I mean, next time you guys can come too if you want," James said a little nervously as he fiddled with his invisibility cloak. Obviously it hadn't really occurred to him how awkward it might be not inviting Remus along tonight but asking him to stay on watch,"Next time," Remus agreed, not feeling up to exploring tonight anyway. He figured the maiden voyage, so to speak, should be the two of them anyway. "Be careful."The two of them disappeared, the entrance opening and shutting seemingly on its own. Once it shut, Remus drew his feet up on the chair to read. The previous year he had only snuck out once, when they hung up Professor Dedenne's underwear in the Great Hall. He enjoyed being out after hours except it also felt awful. He felt super guilty for betraying Dumbledore. Breaking a few small rules (like playing pranks on other students) was one thing however breaking big rules like that he thought he really shouldn't do. As much as he wanted to. Really, really wanted to.Then he realized he had been out after hours at other times. On accident. He hadn't snuck out, both times he had been really upset and hidden somewhere, falling asleep. One of those nights everyone had gotten really worried about him being missing with all the teachers actually searching for him. He shuddered with disgust, thinking about what had caused him to be so upset he wound up essentially going missing.Stupid Dedenne, he thought, looking at the tapestry across the little area from him.You are a Five-X beast! Dedenne's voice echoed in his head. You're not natural, you're not human! He lowered his book, swallowing heavily. You should be locked away from real people. You. Don't. Belong.She was right. Of course. But it still hurt.I hope the new teacher at least tolerates me a little, Remus thought desperately. He deserved to be hated but... didn't he also deserve to be treated fairly? His other teachers that knew treated him fairly. Professor Flitwick treated him the same. Professor Slughorn... well, he acted kinda weird sometimes. Remus thought there was something sneaky about him though maybe it was just because Slughorn was the Head of Slytherin. Then there was McGonagall.Professor McGonagall, whom Remus adored so much it was verging worship. She treated him fairly. Kindly, actually. When he went to her with issues she was always willing to lend a hand. It had been her idea to spell the bed curtains. She had also once called him the most Gryffindor student she'd had in a long time which was a praise he still kept locked up in his heart, giving him warmth. When Remus had told Dumbledore everything Dedenne had said, McGonagall had put her arms around him. Like she cared. Like he deserved her caring.McGonagall was pretty much the most amazing witch Remus had ever met. And since his mother was a Muggle, he could say that statement with absolute surety.James and Sirius didn't come back until nearly four in the morning. Remus was nodding off, waking up whenever the watch made noises at him since he kept setting the alarm every ten minutes. He was very cross with his friends when he opened the door and was bumped into by their invisible bodies, wanting to snap at them for keeping him up so late."It was so amazing," Sirius said as they pulled the cloak off. They were both bright-eyed and pink-cheeked, not at all seeming as though it were nearly dawn. "Oh, wait until you come with us.""It's incredible being able to go wherever without worrying about being seen!" laughed James as they headed to the stairs. "We walked right by Filch!""Though, his cat seemed to suspect something," Sirius added quickly. "Don't like her."James paused right outside the door, Sirius and Remus running into him. "I was thinking, remember when we started writing down information about the school and were sorta doing a map? Now we can really do one, a proper one! Since we can really explore the entire school like this, it can be a super cool map!""Brilliant idea," Sirius said. "We can start doing that soon.""But for now can we go to bed?" Remus grumbled."Ooh, sorry," James giggled, tiptoeing into the dorm. "Night guys!""Night Jimmy, night Remy.""Good morning more like it.""Grouch."/\/\/\/\/\If he was grouchy before bed, he was even grouchier in the morning when he was awoken before nine. It was Sunday. They could sleep in! He didn't even get five hours of sleep! James and Sirius didn't look at all like they only got a little bit of sleep. They were both bouncing around all over the place, talking about the map. Peter was on board for the map. Remus was on board for more sleep.At the Gryffindor table the others ate while Remus just dropped back into sleep, waking up about half an hour later when they finished. He wasn't really that hungry so he just took an apple, following his friends out of the Hall, wondering if they even needed him. He considered just going back to the dorm, especially if they were just going to go explore. In fact he had just decided to do that when they ran into trouble.The four of them were walking down a third floor corridor going one way, while three Slytherins were coming their way. Snape, with two Slytherins they hadn't had much contact with the previous year: Wicket and Fox. Wicket was the tallest of the three with broad shoulders and a thick look to his face, while Fox was the shortest of the three, very burly, very scowly."Such a shame they let people like that walk freely around the castle," Snape said loudly once he saw the Gryffindors."Funny, was thinking the same thing," James said.Snape rolled his eyes. "Brilliant comeback. I suppose for a cub that's considered wit."Sirius tilted his head. "Insulting Gryffindors for being Gryffindors? I'll let your girlfriend know."The affect was exactly what Sirius intended. Snape's sallow face began flushing slightly and he was visibly upset. But before he could come to Lily's defense, Fox said, "Girlfriend? What Slytherin would ever even consider a Gryffindor?" then he and Wicket began laughing. Snape glanced away."Oh, didn't you know about your friend?" James asked. "He—""Shut up, Potter!" Snape's wand was out, pointing at James whose eyes widened. "Nobody wants to listen to your... drivel!"James smirked. "Don't want your Slytherin pals to realize how clo—""FLIPENDO!"James went flying back, slamming into the wall. Remus's jaw dropped a little at how strong the spell had been. He, Sirius, and Peter all stared at Snape who was breathing heavily, looking a little startled himself at what just happened. Wicket and Fox began laughing. Peter ran to James's side while Sirius got his wand out, and spells began going flying. Remus grabbed for his wand, putting the shield spell up just before one of Wicket's spells hit him."Peter!" Sirius shouted, ducking under one of Snape's spells.Peter scrambled over, wand flinging outward. "Flipendo!" he tried, making Fox stumble a bit.The six wizards began fighting more intensely than Remus expected. Spells bounced off shields, walls, the ceiling. Occasionally one hit. Sirius began stumbling with one of his legs jellified, Fox began sneezing rose petals, Peter's hair began going every which way pulling at his scalp, and then Remus felt something sharp slice into his arm. He staggered back, staring in horror at the rip in his sleeve and the blood pouring out. One of them had cut him, not super deep but a couple inches long. Snape had cut him!He looked up, furious. If they were going to be that disgusting, so be it. "Incendio!" Snape's robes caught fire. He began spinning wildly around. "Petrificus—" But Remus was cut off by something slamming painfully against the side of his head. He went down, seeing stars."Don't TOUCH HIM!" Sirius screamed then physically jumped on Fox, sending both of them crashing to the ground. They began rolling back and forth, fists flying. Wicket dove towards them but Peter got the tripping spell off and Wicket went sprawling."Petrificus totalus!" Remus managed to say, throwing the spell to Wicket. His body went stiff as a board. He was taken care of.Snape had managed to put the flames out; he and Remus aimed their wands but since Remus was still rather dizzy from being punched in the side of the head Snape was faster."Langlock!" he got out, and Remus's tongue was glued to the top of his mouth with that bizarre spell he suspected Snape had come up with himself.Snape turned his wand on Peter but before he could do anything he jerked backwards. Great big furry globs of boogers crawled out of his nose, forming bats. Remus looked over at Peter who looked just as surprised. The he glanced backwards. James was getting up off the floor, glasses crooked, blood smeared on his face. The furry bat bogies began flapping around Snape's face, interrupting his spells.There was a crunching sound and Fox cried out in pain. Sirius was on top of him, punching him in the face. Blood flowed from his nose. "Locomotor mortis," James snapped and Fox's legs were glued together. Sirius took his wand, getting up as well, rather precarious on his feet due to his leg issue."Give up, Snape?" James asked, wiping the blood off his chin.Snape swatted a bat away. "Four on—three—isn't—fair!" he got out, ducking away from the bats as they tried to get into his mouth every time it opened."It was three on three since you knocked me out!" James stood tall, chin out, looking quite heroic in Remus's opinion, like out of a book. If the book was about a bespectacled twelve year old wizard dripping blood everywhere. "You're going to reg—""WHAT IS GOING ON?!"The four Marauders turned as Professor Flitwick came running down the hall, shock etched on his face. He stared at the Gryffindors then the Slytherins."Snape ambushed us," Sirius said immediately."They—CHOO!—attacked us!" Fox whined from the ground.Then everyone who could talk (aka not Remus or Wicket) began talking at once until Flitwick snapped his wand, making everyone go silent. He surveyed the scene before him, taking the curses off of Wicket and Fox. Well, the leg-locker curse. Fox still sneezed out rose petals. Another wand movement from Flitwick at the furry bat bogies glopped to the floor. Finally he got rid of whatever spell was on Peter with his hair."Come with me," Flitwick said sternly. "All of you."/\/\/\/\/\They sat in Flitwick's office miserably, waiting for their respective Heads of Houses to arrive. Flitwick sat at his desk with his arms folded, glaring at all seven boys. Occasionally he'd say something about how he couldn't believe such a thing, never in all his days, blah blah blah. None of the boys spoke. Of course, Remus couldn't still due to the tongue thing. Sirius's leg was still rather twitchy from the jelly-leg curse, as Flitwick hadn't noticed it. Snape had been given some burn cream for the scorch marks and was rubbing the spots while glowering at Remus.The door opened, McGonagall sweeping in, Slughorn waddling in after her. "I should have known it was you four," McGonagall said right away, glaring at the Marauders. "Now then, let's find out what happened."Everyone but Remus began talking at once. Slughorn held up his hand then slowly looked at each student. "We'll start from the right. Mr. Wicket?" Of course he started with the Slytherins.So Wicket said he, Fox, and Snape had been walking down the corridor when suddenly the Gryffindors jumped out of no where and started attacking them. Naturally they had to defend themselves. Next was Fox who agreed with Wicket's story, then Snape who also corroborated their lies."Mr. Lupin?" McGonagall asked, as Remus was next to Snape."Nnnglglg." Remus pointed at his mouth."What was that?""Hnnglglg. Glghhghh."McGonagall bent in, peering into Remus's mouth. "I see. Filius, would you mind taking Mr. Lupin to see Poppy? She managed to get this curse off him before. Also, while you're there, find out his side of the story. We'll see if it matches with what Misters Black, Pettigew, and Potter say.""That isn't fair, they got to listen to each other!" Sirius protested.McGonagall looked down her nose at him. "If you speak the truth your story will match Mr. Lupin's, won't it?"Sirius fell silent.Flitwick took Remus out of his office, guiding him along to the hospital wing where Madame Pomfrey was able to get rid of the weird tongue-to-roof-of-mouth spell after several minutes. None of them knew the origins of the spell so it was a little difficult. Then Remus told Professor Flitwick the truth. Snape insulted them, James snapped back, James was about to mention how Snape was friends with a Gryffindor when Snape attacked James. That's when they all started fighting. He wasn't sure who did what for the most part but he held out his arm, showing them the rip."Snape cut me," he said as Pomfrey inspected his skin which had healed already. At least there was still blood soaked in his sleeve to back up that statement. "Fox punched me. Sirius tackled him, then Snape used this tongue spell on me again. James used the bat-bogey hex, then that's when you showed up, Professor Flitwick." He paused then blushed slightly, looking down. "Oh, also I set Snape's robes on fire. After he cut me." He didn't want to confess doing that however felt he should tell the whole truth. He hoped his friends were telling the whole truth too.Back in Flitwick's office everyone had been done telling their story. Flitwick talked to the other two teachers outside in the hall, informing them what Remus had said."You told the truth, right?" Remus whispered."Yeah of course," James replied, rubbing the back of his head. "Unlike some people, we don't lie."Snape snorted loudly at that. "Whoa, don't start a tornado there, Snivellus!" Sirius said, leaning forward to look over at him.The door opened, all three teachers coming back in. None of them look pleased so Remus had no idea what they were thinking. He squirmed a little, crossing his fingers at his side."Ten points each from Mr. Wicket, Mr. Potter, and Mr. Pettigrew, as well as one night of detention each," McGonagall said. Peter squeaked slightly. "Fifteen points each and two nights of detention for Mr. Fox and Mr. Black, for getting into a fist fight as well as magical duel," she continued. "Twenty points, and three nights of detention for Mr. Lupin and Mr. Snape. For slicing into another student and knocking Mr. Potter out for Mr. Snape, as well as setting another student on fire for Mr. Lupin." She gave Remus a very stern look."That isn't fair, Professor!" Sirius protested. "Remus was just—""Fair, Mr. Black?" She arched her eyebrows high. "I believe your punishments are very fair. Lenient, in my opinion. Seven students getting into a fight both magical and physical? Setting each other on fire? I am extremely disappointed. You best be glad I don't give you worse. Now go. Before I change my mind."All of them scuttled out, hesitating right outside the door before the Slytherins headed down while the Gryffindors headed up. Sirius was still having trouble with his leg so Remus began trying to fix it, complaining that he should have mentioned the leg to Flitwick. Sirius was too angry to notice what Remus was saying."Fox punched you, and you get worse than him," he grumbled, limping forward while Remus chased after him with his wand. "It isn't fair.""Course it's not, the Slytherins do what they want," replied James."At least they didn't get completely off the hook?" Peter shook his head. "They should have gotten worse though. Especially Snape. He cut Remus! He knocked you out! It's not right.""No, it isn't right," James said. "We should do something about it.""What can we do about it?" Peter asked. ""Sirius, stand still," Remus finally snarled.He stopped in his tracks. "If the teachers aren't going to do anything—""Locomotor solidus." Remus had to jab at Sirius's leg a few times before it stuck.Sirius bounced a little on the leg to test it out. "Thanks. As I was saying—""I set him on fire, I deserve the detention," said Remus as he tucked his wand away. Detention, already. Three nights of it! He felt absolutely miserable, almost like he might cry but his nose wasn't itching so he didn't think he'd start. Thankfully. Should have just stayed in the dorm this morning, gone back to sleep."It isn't your fault he burns so well, with all that grease," said James as they began walking again. "He knocked me unconscious, he should be expelled. Or at least suspended. I'll write to my dad, he's on the board of governors—""The board of governors is for important matters, not squabbles between students," Remus interrupted."It's not about the fight, it's about them getting let off easily," James replied.Remus threw his hands in the air. "We got off lightly too! I should have gotten in a lot more trouble for setting him ablaze!" James eyed him suspiciously. "Look on the bright side. We won the fight. All four of us standing versus just Snape, who was too busy battling the bogies to do much."Slowly James began smiling. "Ah, true. True. We did do brilliantly. Okay, let's go back to the dorm, get the cloak, then we can hang around the Slytherin common room till we get the password. Then we can get some gooood revenge."However once in the dorm Remus just kicked his shoes off so he could climb into bed for a nap, waving off his friends begging him to come along. They didn't need all four sets of ears to hear the password; besides it wasn't even noon yet and he was already done with the day. He slept soundly through lunch, only waking up in the afternoon when there was a knock at the dorm door."Um, c—come in?" Remus sat up sleepily, blinking as a prefect came in; not the same one who had snapped at James the night before. "If you're looking for James or Sirius—""No, I'm looking for you," replied the prefect. "I was asked to tell you to please report to Office 2C immediately.""2C?" Remus got out of bed. "But that's—" He stopped then thanked the prefect, quickly getting his shoes back on. 2C. That was the office for the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.Looks like their new professor had finally arrived, and wanted a word with Remus./\/\/\/\/\Remus stood in front of the office steps, looking up at the door in confusion. Slowly he went up the few stairs then knocked. He nervously smoothed his hair down while he waited to be answered, wishing he had thought to brush his hair after his long nap. He was a mess. His shirt was all wrinkled with a tear in the sleeve and blood everywhere since he hadn't thought to change his top, and he wore the same mud-stained battered jeans from the day before. He regretted knocking, wishing he had time to run back up to the tower to get changed."Come in!"He took in a deep breath then stepped inside. Immediately he smelled a delicious scent, some sort of baking scent like fresh bread or something. He glanced around, seeing few bookshelves; some of them were full, some of them empty. There were also three dummies used for training, and loads of posters that showed diagrams of useful spells.Remus finally saw the teacher. He was leaning against the desk, a smile on his face. He was rather young, probably only in his twenties, with flaming red hair, hundreds of freckles, and bright blue eyes. "Hello there," he said pleasantly. "You must be Remus." He crossed the room since Remus was standing there like an idiot. "Fabian Prewett," he said, offering his hand.Remus slowly took it, marveling that he was actually touching him. "Um. H—hi." Professor Prewett's hand was very warm."Did I interrupt something?" He looked Remus up and down."Er, n—no. Um. No." He self-consciously tried to smooth his shirt down."Something happen then?" Prewett indicated Remus's blood-stained arm."Er. Uh. Earlier—um, this m-morning." Remus tugged at his sleeve, not sure how to react to this man. He seemed nice enough. But you never knew. "I'm fine."Prewett waved his wand and the sleeve fixed itself. "I'm not too good at getting bloodstains out," he said as he went back to his desk. Remus trailed after him, taking a seat when Prewett motioned. "Now then. I thought it'd be nice to have our first meeting like this, out of the way of class, yeah?" He sat down behind his desk, linking his fingers together.Here we go, Remus thought, looking down at his lap. "Yes s—sir." He remembered the first things Dedenne ever told him, about how she 'didn't care' which was a big lie, then went on to basically insult his intelligence. Did Prewett see him as a dumb, dangerous beast too?"I admit, I don't really know much about werewolves," Prewett said and Remus's stomach twisted hard; it was so similar to Dedenne. I have no personal experience with your kind. "So it will be a bit of a learning experience. I'll do the best I can." Remus remained silent, still doubtful. "Between you and me this whole year will be a learning experience. I never expected to be a teacher.""Did you w—work at the M-Ministry?" Remus asked.Prewett's eyes twinkled. "Yes, I did actually." He sat back, drumming his fingers against the desk. "I didn't work for the W.C.U. if that's what you're looking so anxious about." Remus blushed very slightly, ducking his head. "As I said, I don't know much about werewolves. I've been trying to learn, since Professor D—Albus told me, however most the media is full of anti-werewolf propaganda so I have no idea what's true and what's not.""Which de—d-department d-d-did you w-work in?"Prewett tilted his head. "Law Enforcement, Investigation department."It took a second for that to sink in then Remus's eyes got wide. "You're—you're a detective!"His smile broadened. "Guilty."He didn't know a whole lot about detectives, though one of his favorite book series was about a wizarding detective in the Victorian era. "I—I assumed you d-did something inv—volving dueling," Remus admitted. "Because of the—the book on th-the list."Professor Prewett nodded as Remus spoke. "I love to duel. I'm quite good at it, really; the auror department tried to recruit me however while I feel like dueling is my strongest talent and I would say it is truly my passion in life, I do prefer investigations over hunting dark magical folk down." Remus wondered how he ended up as a teacher then, but didn't think it was his place to ask. Before he could figure out what else to say Prewett asked, "What sort of things do you like to do? What are you passionate about?"Remus shifted in his seat, tugging at his bloody sleeve again. "Read. Um. St—study. Hang out with m-m-my friends." What was he passionate about? Did he have any passions? Learning? Could that be a passion? "I... I love learning." He wasn't sure if that sounded stupid or not."That's good," Prewett replied. "Learning is a great love to have. Anything in particular?""No. Everything. I—I want to know as m-much as I can."Prewett grinned. "Excellent. Very encouraging to hear. Speaking of learning... one of the other reasons I wanted to see you was these." He pulled a thick folder out of his desk, letting it thwump against the surface. "Your test results and grades from last year." Remus's heart sank a little as Prewett opened the folder. "It's very discouraging.""I, er—I—the—well... I—I'm s-sorry, I'll d-d-do better—""Better?" Prewett looked up. "I can't see how you could possibly do better."Remus sat stunned. So. Prewett had decided he was just a dumb beast, then. "Oh," he forced out, all good feelings about the new teacher dissipating."These are already top grades as it is.""...What?"Prewett pulled a few papers out. Remus could see the Ds and Fs even where he sat. "Oh, not the actual grades she gave you. I read through these. You deserved Os in everything you've done. Everything. I didn't see a single thing here that warranted less than a hundred percent. I've spoken to Albus, and he's given me permission to retest you. Fix these." He waved one of the papers at him. "It's going to be a bit of work on your behalf, so if you don't want to—""No!" Remus shot forward, practically falling off his chair. "I mean, I want to. Yes. Please. I—I want. Er, to." He felt dizzy with ecstasy, unable to believe his ears. A chance to change what Dedenne had done to him? His grades, at least? It felt as though his heart might just pound right out of his best."I thought as much." He shoved the folder back in the drawer then began scribbling some things down. "Here's a list of essays I'd like from you over the course of September. We can work out days for you to retake tests another time, I know the start of school is a pretty distracting time..." Prewett began speaking about the various tests he'd be taking, some of the things expected from him, etc, etc. Remus kept nodding, astounded at his luck. How did this happen? Did Prewett have a werewolf relative, like Fawley? Why else would he be going to this length to help a monster? Except no, he said he didn't know much about werewolves. So... why...?Then, suddenly, Prewett stood up. "I need to get some more things together this afternoon. I believe I won't be seeing you until Tuesday afternoon, but if you need anything in the mean time you know where to find me." He offered his hand and this time Remus gladly shook it."Thank you, sir," he whispered. "Thank you s—ss-so much."He left the office, clutching the essays to his chest, unable to believe what just happened.

It wasn't until after Remus climbed all the way to the tower to get his stuff and all the way down to the library that he realized he was still in the bloody shirt and muddy jeans. The thought of returning to his dorm was too much so he just marched into the library, not really caring. He wanted to find books to help him work on the essay list Prewett had given him... until he realized that he was supposed to be meeting up with his study group after lunch. He glanced at the clock. It was nearly two. Were they still there? He wasn't sure exactly what time, just that Lily said after lunch. He was also supposed to have talked to Silverlocke and hadn't. He couldn't believe he had forgotten everything, however between the fight and Prewett...He crept towards the table, immediately relieved to see Silverlocke there. Everyone else was there too. Florence Buckling of Ravenclaw was the first to notice him standing off to the side. "Oh, hullo Lupin," she said, and everyone looked up."Hi. Er, s—sorry I'm l-late." He slid into his usual seat next to Lily, ignoring the stares his bloody shirt was being given. "How much d-did I miss?""We've been going over the assignments for the summer," said Raven Craft, also a Ravenclaw and one of the snobbiest people Remus had ever met."We're almost done with them," chimed in Matilda Twycross, a Gryffindor, one of the other snobbiest people Remus had ever met. There was also something about her that rubbed him the wrong way, he just didn't know exactly what it was."We were just about to discuss when we should meet," put in Simon Bones, a Hufflepuff who always seemed to have a smile. Remus liked him."We were thinking about Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, just to make it simple," said Kyra Pierce, also a Hufflepuff as well as the only other Muggleborn besides Lily in the group. "After supper," she added."That w—would work out for me," Remus mumbled. He wanted to apologize to Lily and Silverlocke for not seeking him out the evening before, however didn't want to get into that sort of thing in front of the others. Or rather, in front of Craft."I have something else I'd like to bring up," Lily said in an Important sort of voice. "The matter of other students joining our group."Pierce raised her eyebrows. "Anyone's welcome," she said. "That's pretty obvious, isn't it?"Remus knew she was meaning Silverlocke, the Slytherin. Craft and Twycross both held bitterness over the fact a Slytherin joined them, even though Silverlocke was very intelligent, and very nice."She's a first year," Lily said.That got surprised looks. They had never once discussed the possibility of students from other years joining them. Last year it had only been them, first years. Remus had sorta expected it to remain merely students in their own year. He didn't like the idea of older students joining—they made him extra nervous—though younger students might not be too bad.Craft folded his hands on the table. "I don't think that's a good idea. A first year can't help us. It wouldn't be fair.""I disagree," Silverlocke said softly. Craft glowered at him. "Just because we're second years doesn't mean we should forget everything we've learned in our first. Going over these lessons with a first year can only assist in furthering our education.""That's true," Remus agreed, garnering Craft's angry gaze. "Wh—when I go over things with m-my friends, it helps me s-see things I might not have thought about in the—the first place.""But they're the same year as you," Twycross pointed out. "Plus I really don't see how going over Pettigrew's homework helps you in any way, he's an idiot.""He's n-nnn-not an idiot!" Remus snapped. He's nicer than you in any case, but Remus didn't say that out loud.Twycross opened her mouth however it was Buckling who spoke, interrupting before Twycross could rant about Peter. "Who were you thinking about asking?"Lily brushed her hair back. "Her name is Mary Macdonald. She's Muggleborn. And really overwhelmed by everything. I thought it'd be nice to offer a helping hand. She—well, it's like—um..." Lily suddenly blushed a little, quickly stopping then saying, "In any case, I thought it would be good."Remus, Silverlocke, Pierce, Bones, and Buckling all agreed. Craft and Twycross didn't seem pleased however they were clearly outvoted. On the way back to the tower (Remus with a bag full of books he checked out for his essays) he inquired about what she hadn't said when she mentioned Macdonald, that made her blush.Lily glanced ahead at Twycross then slowed down a bit, to make sure the other girl couldn't hear them. "She went through a similar thing I did," she explained. "Being called names. Teased. Bullied. Called weird. A—a freak..." Remus knew that word in particular hurt her since it was what her sister sometimes used. "I heard crying last night, in the first years' bathroom, and went in. She was so scared of everything. Very... overwhelmed, like I said. I chatted with her to try to calm her down and we just ended up comparing our lives. How similar they were, with how we were treated by our Muggle peers. Afterwards she just... felt so happy, is what she said. Like she wasn't alone. It probably doesn't make much sense.""No, it does," Remus promised. "I'm glad she has someone like you around. I mean, you had—had Snape so when you came here you weren't all alone.""Exactly." Lily gave him a brilliant smile which quickly faded. "Oh. You—you didn't... did you... I mean, you knew a lot about magic but you weren't used to people..." She trailed off, flinching. "I'm just making a mess of things."Remus gave her a tentative smile. "It's all right. And you're right. I didn't have anyone, and I was absolutely terrified.""You could barely even speak. Except in class, answering questions." Lily stopped walking altogether. "You hardly even stutter anymore, except when you're around people you don't know too well. You don't stutter at all around me and those idiots except when you get mad or upset.""Even after a year at school it makes me nervous being around people..."They began walking again then after another flight of stairs Lily said, "So Gryffindor's down fifty-five points already." Remus closed his eyes, wishing she hadn't brought this up. "Your friends have anything to do with that?""Y... yes..." He tugged at the strap of his satchel, hoping she wouldn't press. Course, she'd find out eventually. The moment she met up with Snape he'd probably tell her how he was set on fire. "I did too," he said, not wanting to confess, not wanting her to know."You?! What did you do?"Remus sighed. "Got into a—a fight. They started it.""They who?""Does it matter?"Lily's eyes narrowed. "They who, Remus?" she demanded.Another sigh. "Slytherins," he mumbled, tugging at the strap now. "Wicket. Fox. Um.""Um?" Lily stopped walking once more, grabbing Remus's arm, spinning him around to face him. "Tell me.""Snape," he said, meeting her stare. "Snape started it. He used the knockback jinx on James. Knocking him out, I might add. Then the rest of us got into a duel. That's why Slytherin and Gryffindor lost points today.""Potter probably deserved it. Don't look at me like that, he's a total git!" Lily released his arm and began rubbing her shoulder, eyes flickering away from his. "Who started the duel?""I told you. Snape. He threw James back."She didn't look entirely convinced. "Is the duel how you got blood on you?"Remus looked down at his arm. "Yeah. Snape cut me."Her face paled at that. "He—he didn't." She bit her bottom lip, shifting her weight to her other foot. "Did he?""He did." He told her about the fight, the spells used including him setting Snape on fire which made her go red now, with anger. He did not tell her why Snape had thrown James back... that he hadn't wanted his Slytherin pals to know how close to Lily he was. Not to defend Snape, but to protect Lily. It would only hurt her. He also told her about the punishments they received.Lily pursed her lips, remaining silent during the entire explanation. Once he finished, she began grumbling. "Potter and Black deserve worse. Potter probably started it." Then she stopped, looking a little awkward. "Oh dear, I'm doing it again, aren't I?""Yes," Remus said. The previous year they had had a big row about Snape, and Lily had said she'd stop automatically assuming he was the victim all the time. Although to be fair she had said she'd merely stop when it was between Snape and Remus, she never said anything about when it involved the other Marauders. "He started it, he knocked James unconscious, he cut my arm open. Perhaps I shouldn't have set him on fire but frankly the git deserved it." He hesitated then added, "I know James and Sirius do a lot of things, I'm not trying to say they're always innocent because they're not. But neither is he."She nodded, head ducked a little as she looked quite guilty. "You really set him on fire, though?"They began walking again. "I did. I was so mad he cut me. It was really painful! But still, I shouldn't have. I deserve the det—errr..." He began panicking as she took his arm, pushing back his sleeve. "Pomfrey healed it," he explained."You still have dried blood all over you," she said, seeing the red on his arm. "You never even took a shower?""I-I w-was tired...""For Pete's sake!" She began pushing at him gently. "Come on, tower, shower, now. Clean clothes."He allowed himself to be taken up to the common room where she gave him another light shove towards the boys' stair. He gave her a smile then went up the stairs to get cleaned up, at least that was his intention. When he got to the dorm he put his bag down and took the books out intending to stack them on his desk for after his shower. But he got very distracted, remembering something in one of the books so he sat down and flipped through. After reading ten or so minutes he got parchment out to begin his first essay, forgetting entirely about the shower./\/\/\/\/\Professor Prewett was introduced at supper. As soon as the four Marauders went into the Great Hall they began whispering at the sight of the redheaded man at the table. Then Sirius dropped a bombshell as they took their seats."That's my cousin.""What?!"Remus stared in shock at Sirius then up at Professor Prewett. How on earth could they be cousins?! They looked nothing alike! And if they were cousins how come Sirius didn't know about his appointment of Professor?"Not immediate cousins," he explained, noticing the surprised expressions on Remus and Peter's face. "I never see him. But his uncle married my aunt. So, cousin by marriage, and I never really see those cousins." He shrugged, as if it didn't really matter. "Uncle Ignatius is welcome around the family dinners, but not the rest of the family."Dumbledore introduced him a little bit later after most the students arrived, and everyone was talking about him, wondering who he was, why he hadn't shown up till today."He's probably an Auror," James theorized. "Is he?""He does work in the Ministry but I'm not really sure what he does," Sirius replied. "He's got a brother, and they both work at the Ministry. One of them is an auror. It's probably him then," he added, nodding up to Professor Prewett.Remus bit back the comment that no, he was a detective. He didn't want to tell them he already met Prewett. That he was nice. That he knew what Remus was and shook his hand—twice!—and was giving him the opportunity to make up for the abysmal grades Dedenne gave him the previous year."He looks pretty young," James noted."He's in his twenties, that's about all I know," replied Sirius, obviously not caring to talk about his cousin. He seemed a little disappointed that the mysterious teacher was a relative of his."Not as young as that professor," Peter said, indicating a young witch who really couldn't be older than twenty."I want to take her class," Sirius said, gazing rather adoringly at the witch. "Which one does she teach?""Her name is Vector. She's an assistant in Arithmancy," Remus said, vaguely recalling what Cassandra Inkwood had told him a couple months ago."Arithmancy?" Sirius frowned. "Ew. That's gonna take a lot of thought, whether or not to take it. Just an assistant? Not the actual professor? So we might get a different teacher?""Plenty of time," James said, shoveling food into his mouth. "We don't have to decide for ages. So anyway, I was thinking, detention on the second day isn't good enough. I think next year we should aim to getting detention as soon as possible, like, the first night! How epic would that be? We'd have to do something big to—Sirius? Hey, Sirius? Are you even paying attention?"Professor(?) Vector was talking animatedly with Professor Prewett while Sirius and Peter both were looking at her with expressions that Remus personally thought was better reserved for Honeydukes Finest chocolate, or a really good book.James nudged at Remus, making a face. Remus grinned back. James scooped some mashed potatoes onto his spoon, aiming for Sirius, raising his eyebrows at Remus who nodded. The potatoes flew, squishing into Sirius's beloved hair. He yelped, hand flying to the back of his head. "J-James!" he gasped out while James and Remus laughed, along with a few other Gryffindors who had seen. "Why'd'you do that?!"James shrugged, scooping up some more potatoes but this he put in his mouth. "You weren't listening to me."Sirius blinked twice then, without breaking his stare on James, scooped up a handful of peas and lobbed them at James. They went everywhere. Most went into James's clothes but several went rolling across the table and floor, some on other students. James stared open-mouthed at Sirius then grabbed a small plate with butter on it."Don't," Sirius said.It hit him right in the face.All around them students had gone quiet as they waited to see what happened next; Remus hesitated then dove under the table just as the food began flying. He heard shrieks, laughs, screams, protests; he heard the splattering of food, the clash of dishes. The food fight spread from the Gryffindors across the hall until everyone was involved ans the teachers were yelling, trying to get things calmed down. Remus wasn't alone under the table. A few others had taken haven there. Remus glanced around seeing under the other tables. Snape was hiding under the Slytherin table, watching with wide eyes. Not seeing Remus.Remus slowly took his wand out. "Locomotor tureen," he hissed out, flicking his wand at a tureen of gravy that still sat on the Slytherin table. It wriggled then slid off the table, tipping over right onto Snape who shouted, flailing. Remus only half-hoped it wasn't too hot. Snickering, he tucked his wand back into his pocket just as someone grabbed him by the back of his shirt (which still had blood on it). He yelled as he was hauled out by Sirius."Not getting out of it that easily, Remy," Sirius said then poured a pitcher of pumpkin juice over his head.Remus gasped in shock as the cold liquid covered him. He stared open-mouthed up at Sirius then closed his mouth so suddenly his teeth clacked loudly together. "You—YOU!" Remus grabbed a cottage pie off the Hufflepuff table, chucking it at Sirius's face or trying to. He missed, however got a great glob of it on Sirius's shoulder. Someone shoved something cold down the back of Remus's shirt and he spun around to see Peter giggling. He went after Peter who slipped in some food trying to get away, crashing to the ground. Remus took a bottle of ketchup, twisting off the cap to splatter it all over Pete who rolled on the floor trying to get up. Then he slipped as well, going down, laughing. He and Peter held onto each other, trying to get up."Noooo!" Peter cried out.Remus looked up to see a large bowl of pudding hovering over them. His eyes went down, seeing sparkling green eyes. Lily grinned at him, flicked her wand, and the bowl turned over, dumping the whole lot over the two of them. Remus scooped up a handful and squidged about in the food as he tried to get to Lily who yelped and skid as she tried to escape. Remus dove at her, grabbing hold of her, shoving the pudding the back of her shirt just as a voice shouted out a spell which froze everyone on the spot. It was extremely awkward for Remus, his hand in Lily's shirt."Now that I have your undivided attention," Dumbledore said, wand raised, "I bid you all a speedy return to your dorms."He lowered his arm which removed the spell so everyone could move again. A few people fell to the floor. Remus quickly yanked his hand out of Lily's shirt, blushing a bit, mumbling an apology."Least he let us have a food fight for several minutes," Lily said, wiping some sticky red substance off her face. "I expected him to stop it immediately."Remus thought that was true. The food fight had gone on for a good ten minutes before Dumbledore ended it. He looked up at the High Table and even from there could see the twinkle in the Headmaster's eyes. McGonagall was making her way through the mess with a pinched face. She caught up to the Gryffindors easily enough, hands grabbing Sirius and James's collars."Not you two," she said, pulling them back. "You two will come with me. I'm not blind, I saw exactly how this started. You just had points removed only a few hours ago! You already have detention! Already getting more, I swear you two are purposely trying to ruin Gryffindor's chances of ever winning the House Cup again..." Her voice was still going on as she dragged the two out of the Great Hall.Lily, her friends Colgate and Inkwood, Peter, and Remus all trudged up to the tower together, leaving a trail of food behind them that Remus knew would give Filch a heart attack. He didn't particularly care, to be honest. He was too busy giggling over the whole thing with the others. Colgate had a whole carrot stuck in her hair which they all found to be tremendously funny. She pulled it out then stood on tiptoes to stick it in the mouth of a suit of armor like a cigar, which nearly sent the entire group to the floor with laughter./\/\/\/\/\James and Sirius lost another ten points bringing the total loss in a few hours to 65 points. Most the table on Monday morning was glaring at the Marauders. James and Sirius didn't seem to notice, or care. They were too busy complaining about having to deal with the Slytherins right after breakfast ("Puts me right off my appetite," Sirius grumbled). Remus wasn't happy about Potions being first for an entirely different reason which was the fact he sucked at Potions. He hoped it would just be reviewing, he didn't want to deal with stinky ingredients.Unfortunately, it turned out to be a mix of both. After a quick roll call, Professor Slughorn wrote down Forgetfulness Potion, which had been part of their final exam, one Remus had totally messed up. A lot of the ingredients smelled rather awful so mixed together it was an assault on his sense of smell. Luckily, though, they were able to partner up. He figured he'd be with one of the Marauders though it took a few minutes of quiet whispering to decide who would be stuck with Remus. Ultimately Sirius went with him, as he cared less about his Potion grades than James and Peter (especially Peter, who was actually fairly decent in this class)."We should sneak some of this into some Slytherin food," Sirius said as he began working. Remus read the instructions, helping out with some of the ingredients. He focused on making sure things were chopped up evenly however for the life of him he couldn't get things right. "Speaking of Slytherins, we need the perfect prank to pull on them. Their common room, I mean, since we got their password. Something good. You can think of something, right?""Maybe." Remus carefully added some mistletoe berries into the mortar and then began crushing them."The spiderweb thing would be great.""It would, however it links back to us," Remus pointed out. "At least, it links to a Gryffindor."Sirius pulled a face. "Right. Friday night. Common room. Drat. We really can't repeat anything. Not that I'd want to. We need something new." Sirius stirred the potion, barely paying any kind of attention. Remus tipped the crushed berries in, wincing when he realized they hadn't all been crushed well enough. The potion turned a rather ugly sort of grey color. It was supposed to be orange. "D'you think we should we target the common room? Or do you think we should we just target a dorm?""I think we should stop talking about it in the middle of the class with the Slytherins, and the Head of Slytherin," Remus said, shooting Sirius a dark look.Sirius stared at him now then grinned sheepishly. "You're right. Whoops.""Idiot. How you get away with anything is beyond me."Sirius gave Remus a big wink. "My good looks," he said with quite a charismatic smile as he bumped his shoulder gently against Remus's.Remus rolled his eyes then ducked his head, feeling even hotter all of a sudden as well as a weird twisty sort of feeling inside of him... though that was probably just from all the smells affecting him. That was it.

Remus was still feeling a little confused from the weirdness of Potions, so after Charms when they went to lunch he decided to sit with Lily, as well as Colgate and Inkwood, though the topic seemed to be mostly about Professor Prewett. He was, according to all three girls, cute.Remus poked at his food, trying not to make a face. "If you're just g-going to talk about guys then I'm off," he complained.All three girls giggled. "Sorry, Remus, forgot for a second you were with us," Lily said. "Though I'm sure you and your friends probably talk about girls a lot.""No. Not really." Then he remembered the way Sirius and Peter had been eyeing Professor Vector the night before. "Well. I don't.""Who do they talk about, then?" Inkwood asked.He didn't want to tell them how much discussion there had been at the end of their first year, when they all got into the big water fight and his friends had definitely noticed the girls' wet white shirts. Even with a whole summer behind him, he still didn't quite get it. He previously wondered if there was something broken about him, because of his lycanthropy. Now he wondered that again. His dad had been 'about' his age when he started noticing girls. Sirius and Peter were noticing girls. James sorta noticed girls. Lily, Colgate, and Inkwood seemed to be noticing boys. So... what was wrong with him?So Remus shrugged. "I don't know. I don't really pay much attention.""You're adorable," Colgate said.Remus went red while all the girls giggled. He wished he had sat with the boys instead. Adorable?! This was the second time a girl had called him adorable, and he still didn't appreciate it. Small fluffy animals were adorable. Not him.After lunch was a free period then History of Magic, which Sirius declared to be 'nap time, then another nap time'. Even Remus struggled to pay attention in history class. Professor Binns was absolutely boring. Still, he took notes while doing his best not to fall asleep. Then once they were done with that, they headed to Transfiguration.Professor McGonagall watched the students come in, eyes narrowing a little as the Marauders came in. She took two points away: one for how untidy Remus was, the other for how untidy James was. Remus awkwardly tried to fix his tie but just made it worse. Even after a year he still had no idea how to properly do ties. He needed to ask Sirius for help, whose ties always looked absolutely perfect.McGonagall took a quick roll call then jumped into a quick lecture on how she hoped everyone retained their knowledge from the previous year, and she'd be making sure by a quick test. There were groans from almost everyone but Remus sat up a little straighter, glad they were jumping right into using spells. He missed this.The first twenty minutes was spent going over some of the spells they learned in their first year then she began talking about one of the most useful and important transfiguration spells: the untransfiguration spell. She turned a large goblet into a partially transfigured object. It had wings and a beak, trying to flutter. "Reparifarge," she said, and the thing returned to being a goblet.She handed out half-finished objects to each student. Remus cringed a little at his. A half-mouse-half-snuffbox that gave pathetic attempts to walk around on its tiny little bronze feet. It had whiskers, ears, a tail, yet no mouth so he wasn't sure how it made squeaking sounds. It broke his heart. He took in a deep breath, focused hard, then flourished his wand. "Reparifarge!" The feet, whiskers, and tail shrank into the snuffbox though the ears remained. At least it wasn't squeaking anymore. "Reparifarge!" The ears melted into the metal."Very good, Mr. Lupin, a point to Gryffindor," McGonagall said, nodding approvingly. Then she tapped the snuffbox, turning it back into the partial mouse.Couldn't she make it partially a plant? he thought as the squeaking started again. He sorta wanted to throw up. "Reparifarge!" This time only the tail remained. "Reparifarge..." It was a snuffbox again. He glanced up towards McGonagall however she was looking past him."Mr. Potter, very good, a point to Gryffindor as well," she said then her lips formed a thin line. "Mr. Black, where is your jar?"Remus turned to look behind him at Sirius whose elbows were propped on the empty desk. "Um. It flew off," he replied, waving his hand towards the open window."Your... jar... did not have wings," she said slowly.Sirius shrugged. "It grew wings." James smothered his face, shoulders shaking with laughter.McGonagall marched over, plopping another object on his desk. "Let's see you fix this," she commanded.Sirius blew his hair from his face and gave his wand a rather showy flourish. "Reparifarge!" he said intensely, the spell shooting out to the furry jar. It wriggled a bit, turned back into a proper jar, fell over, rolled off his desk, and shattered into several pieces. Sirius beamed. "Hey, I turned it back!" he exclaimed as several other students laughed.McGonagall fixed the jar, half-transformed it, then set it on James's desk. "Your turn."James pushed his glasses up and licked his lips as he focused on the jar. "Reparifarge!" he said, giving an equally showy flourish. It turned back into a jar, remaining firmly on his desk. He cocked his head to one side, grinning from ear-to-ear at the teacher. "Voila," he said.She just swept back to the front of the room, getting bigger, more complicated objects for Remus and James to work on. By the end of class both boys were sweaty and exhausted, glad they didn't have any other classes that day."Why does she hate us?" James grumbled after they left the room."She doesn't hate us, she gave us so much work because we were able to do it," Remus pointed out.James scrunched his face up. "So, basically, pretend I can't do it? Then I won't have as much work?" Remus stared in horror at his friend while Sirius and Peter both agreed that was a cracking idea. James grinned, a bounce in his step. "Don't get me wrong. I like Transfiguration, it's really easy for me—the easiest, I mean—but still, I don't want to be this tired after every class with her. I need to save all my energy for Quidditch. S'more important anyway. By the way, Bell said tryouts will be Saturday!" James looked at his friends, mostly at Remus. "You'll all be there, right?""Um, duh," Sirius said."Why wouldn't we?" Peter asked.Remus nodded. "Of course."James began bouncing along even happier now. "Perfect. C'mon, I need a shower, then we can work out what sort of prank to pull in the Slytherin common room."/\/\/\/\/\Please report to Professor Dumbledore's office tomorrow after Herbology. Pepper Imps.Remus stared at the note an owl delivered to him during supper in confusion, as well as a little bit of fear. The old feeling he used to get constantly during his first term at school came back with a vengeance. They don't want you here anymore, you're going to be expelled. He shook his head at the dark voice. If they didn't want him back they would have said so over summer. Still, what on earth could Dumbledore want?"You all right, Remus?" Peter's voice broke into his thoughts. "You've gone pale. Is that the detention slip?""We all would have gotten one if it was," James pointed out.Peter stuck his tongue out. "Not always! Sometimes even when we all have detention they come at different times!"Remus carefully folded the slip up. "No, it's from—from Pomfrey. She wants to see me tomorrow, before lunch.""Is everything all right?" Sirius asked, brow wrinkling a bit."Yes, of course. Just... a check up, that's all, since she hasn't seen me since June." That was a believable enough lie. James and Peter seemed satisfied. Sirius just stared at him with a frown which made him uncomfortable. Please believe the story, he thought, trying to send out waves of trustworthy aura. Finally Sirius returned to eating.After supper Remus went to the first real meeting of their study group. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs already had Defense Against the Dark Arts, and shared their thoughts. Bones thought Prewett seemed 'pretty neat' and more active than Dedenne. More lively. Pierce agreed with this, also stating how cute he was (Bones rolled his eyes at that). Buckling's opinion was that Prewett seemed very sharp and if you asked her (which they were) they were in for a pretty intense year of dueling. Craft didn't like him."That's because Professor Prewett told him he needed to loosen up," Buckling giggled.Craft glowered at her. "That isn't why I don't like him. I think he's too... young.""I have him first thing tomorrow morning," Silverlocke said."We get him after lunch," Lily put in. "I can't wait. He seems...""Cute?" offered Pierce."No!" Lily flushed a faint pink. "Interesting," she said rather haughtily as she flipped open a book. Remus resisted the urge to point out she called him cute that afternoon.Loosen up, Remus wondered as he, Lily, and Twycross left the library. What on earth does that mean? Loosen up for what?He didn't go back to the tower right away, instead he went to the owlery to use a school owl, to send a letter to his parents. He had realized that McGonagall probably sent a letter to them informing them of his detention, so he wanted to send his own to 'explain'. As in, lie. He had written he had been 'sucked in' when he had been innocently walking by, stating that the Slytherins had been attacking some other Gryffindors and when they saw him they assumed he was with the other Gryffindors so they attacked him too.I should not have fought, I apologize completely for this, but I had to defend myself! he had written desperately, praying that they'd believe him! He wasn't sure what would have been in the letter from McGonagall but he hoped it wouldn't be anything about his friends...Once in his dorm Remus set his stuff out to work on his special essays. Everything Prewett had listed were pretty simple, most of them relatively short. There were ten listed and he had already finished one and a half since yesterday. Did Prewett really expect him to take the entire month to do these? He'd be able to get them done by Saturday, if he worked hard enough. The only one that would give him trouble was the one about gytrashes since they hadn't learned about them at all in their first year. He didn't know much about them and was very surprised when he read that they were similar to the Black Dog legend, which was where he had gotten Gwyllgi's name from; except Gwyllgi was an actual legend whereas gytrashes were real. And could be found in the Forbidden Forest, according to the book. Remus shivered a bit, glad they hadn't come across any during their adventures! Although it seemed gytrashes were nocturnal. Probably.Music blared around him, the other Marauders dancing around while they talked about various things most especially ideas of pranks for the Slytherins now that they had the password."Remuuuus!" Sirius flung himself at Remus, knocking his arm which sent a great black slash across his parchment. "Sorry. Um, come on, we need some brainy advice for this.""I'm busy," Remus complained as he got his wand out. They were to learn a helpful spell this year, later on in Charms, to remove ink smudges and he might as well give it a go now. "Cha—""Remus, come on we need advice!" James said.Sirius poked at Remus. "Please? You can do your homework later, this is more important."It seemed he wasn't going to be left alone. He put the stopper back in his inkwell and turned the chair around to face the others. "What sort of advice?" he asked, rubbing his temples as he felt a headache from the loud music. Headaches were always frustrating. They started, then his regeneration ability would help get rid of it, but usually it would just start again. The start-stop-start-stop drove him mad and he would have much preferred the pain to just stay."We have three ideas," Peter said, clapping his hands. "Each of us came up with one.""But we won't tell you who came up with what, so you won't be biased," Sirius added.I wouldn't be biased anyway, he thought then shrugged. "All right.""Idea one!" James thrust his finger in the air. "Sticking spells in their shoes so when they put them on they get stuck. Idea two, dead fish on top of their canopies." Remus knew that one was Sirius's since he had considered the prank before, with Spinnet. "And idea three... taking some of the underwear from the Slytherin girls and putting them in the boys' dorm so they get in trouble."Remus snorted loudly, covering his mouth. "They're all good but the last one's my favorite—"Peter pumped his fists in the air while James and Sirius pouted. "Yes!""—but we can't do it."Peter dropped his hands. "How come?""Because their staircases are enchanted the same way ours are," Remus explained. "If one of us tries to go to the girl dorms it will turn into a slide and the alarm will sound."He expected James to be victorious they couldn't do Pete's trick (which meant the sticking spell shoes was his) however instead he looked deep in thought. "Not necessarily," he said slowly.Remus sighed heavily, feeling the headache growing. "Yes necessarily. It's laid out clearly in Hogwarts, A History. All of the dorms are set up that way."James flapped his hand. "No! I mean, yeah it might do that but... we could probably get around it. We need to test it. Here, in the tower, we can test it. Maybe tomorrow night during dinner. Or lunch. When almost everyone else is out of the tower."Remus folded his arms, raising his eyebrows. "And what is this great idea?""Remember what I mentioned before? When we tried?" His friend slid over to his bed, pulling his broom carrying case out from under his bed. "The siren sounds when a boy's foot hits the stairs..." He unsnapped the clasps and flicked the lid open. "But what if a boy's foot doesn't hit the stairs?"They wanted to test it out immediately but of course they couldn't since the common room was super crowded. Sirius wanted to wait till everyone went to bed then test it but Remus shot that one down, stating how awful it was if using a broom didn't work they'd just wake up the entire tower. Peter stated how James's idea of waiting till a meal time would work best, and finally they talked Sirius round to agreeing. After that big to-do they wound up playing the board game Hippogriff Flip for a while, played cards, ate sweets, ignored Spinnet when he and Struthers finally came into the dorm and Spinnet complained about them 'always taking over the dorm', stayed up probably way too late, and as Remus climbed into bed he realized he hadn't gotten the essay done at all.Maybe I do need the whole month, he thought before falling asleep./\/\/\/\/\Remus spent breakfast studying up on gytrashes for the essay, so into the book he didn't hear the bell ringing and had to be tapped on the shoulder by Sirius. He quickly shoved the book bag in his bag as he took off after his friends. They went out into the bright morning sunshine and it wasn't until they approached the greenhouses that he realized he hadn't eaten any breakfast.Professor Sprout took them to Greenhouse Three which was very exciting. Remus (and most the others) had expected to go to Greenhouse Two. They were whispering as they went in, taking up spots along a very long table. There were dozens of pots and colorful earmuffs sprinkled around which made sense when Sprout explained they were working with mandrakes. Remus was a little surprised. Mandrakes could be pretty dangerous.Remus raised his hand when Sprout asked about them. "They're used for m-medicinal p-p-purposes," he said when she nodded at him. "It's a common ingredient in m-many antidotes and rest-toratives. A lot of the p-potions you can make are used to heal th-those who have been t-t-transfigured or—or cursed." He faltered a little at the end, a memory rushing back to him. His father planting a mandrake in the backyard, he and Hope taking care of it. It was cheaper to get an actual mandrake rather than its grown leaves so that's why they went that route. It took months but when the mandrake was grown Lyall had made a potion, forcing Remus to drink it. It heals those whose forms have been cursed, he explained as Remus crinkled his nose up at the awful smell. Maybe it will cure you.He still recalled the disappointed look Lyall got after the next full moon."Very good, five points to Gryffindor," Sprout said. "Mandrakes, while very essential, are also very dangerous. Does anyone know why? Lupin?"Remus lowered his hand, staring down at the tufts of leaves sticking out of the pots. "Because when they're older their cr-cry is fatal to—to anyone who hears it. However these l-ll-look to be very—y-young so the most these ones can do is—is just kn—knock you out for a couple hours." He was aware of Sirius and James elbowing each other at that, getting a bad feeling."Very good, another five points. Have you dealt with mandrakes before?"He shook his head. "No, ma'am," he lied. "J-just read about them." Sprout knew he was a werewolf however mandrakes—while a common potion ingredient—was not a common garden plant and he worried it would seem odd to some of the students if he told the truth that he had, in fact, had one in his garden for a while.Everyone grabbed for a pair of earmuffs, Remus ending up with the garish orange ones since he didn't care about colors. Remus felt a wave of absolute joy when the earmuffs clamped into place. They were magicked to block out all sound and for once in his life (that he could remember) he felt at peace. No sounds. No background noises. No distant voices, leaves rustling, animals moving, things knocking together, footsteps, nothing. He could hear his blood pounding in his body, in his head. A sort of weird sound that he wasn't sure what it belonged to but it must have been something from within. He was so distracted by not hearing anything that he didn't realize Sprout had pulled the mandrake out until she was putting it into another pot. Its mouth was wide open as it squalled, nobody hearing it. Sprout packed dirt around it then gave a thumbs up indicating everyone could take the muffs off. Remus didn't want to. He wanted to keep these forever. Reluctantly he removed them, barely paying attention as Sprout talked about what they'd be doing. He clutched at the orange faux-fur, wondering if he could steal them.Merlin, your friends are rubbing off on you, he thought as he put them on the table. But he had to put them back on so they could work on repotting which was not very easy. The mandrakes fought violently getting out of the pot as well as going into the new ones. James had one that clung to the pot's edge and when he tried to pry its little fingers loose the mandrake sunk its teeth into his glove. James's arm began flailing, the mandrake flying back and forth in the air. Sirius grabbed the mandrake then Remus and Peter joined in, and it took all four of them to get the mandrake off of James whose lips were forming swear words. It was so bizarre doing all of this only hearing his own inner body.Sirius held the mandrake, Peter kept its head still, and Remus poked his finger into its mouth to push its mouth open. The mandrake let go of James who went tumbling backwards, but the teeth came down onto Remus's glove. His friends tried helping him but he shook his head, transferring the mandrake into a new pot. Since it was busy biting Remus's hand it didn't fight too much until it realized it was halfway covered in dirt (which was difficult with one hand however Peter quickly joined in to help with the dirt). It let go of Remus's hands and began fighting but it was too late, and Remus got it covered.All four boys slumped against the table, panting heavily. They still had several mandrakes to go. They exchanged looks then began working again, this time going two per mandrake which sped up the process a lot. In fact, despite James's incident, they were the first table done. Sprout examined the pots then wrote down that they got five points each plus got to leave a little early. Gryffindor had gotten thirty-five points in one class! Which helped make up some for all the points lost Sunday."That was annoying," Peter said as soon as they left the greenhouse and could take their earmuffs off. They left them by the door though Remus stared at his, a longing feeling curling around him as he walked away."No it was brilliant!" James pumped a fist in the air. "We have to get a mandrake.""Why?!" Peter demanded, looking disgusted.James flung an arm across Peter's shoulders. "That is what we're doing to the Slytherins.""YES!" Sirius shouted."No!" Remus gasped out. "Are you crazy?! Did—did-did you NOT hear me say their cries are fatal? Do you not know what fatal means?"James rolled his eyes. "I know what fatal means. I'm not meaning adult mandrakes. Young ones. Knock the Slytherins out for a few hours.""We can rig it up so when someone opens the door the pot falls, breaks open, and then the cries hit them," Sirius said, rubbing his filthy hands together. All four of them were covered in dirt and sweat."No!" Remus snapped. "No way! No! Breaking into the greenhouse? No! I refuse to be part of this."James, Sirius, and Peter all gave him disappointed looks. "Fine," James said rather stiffly. "We'll do it without you."Remus took a few quick steps, grabbing James's sleeve. "It's too risky, too dangerous! Besides, you could hurt the—""Who cares if we hurt a Slytherin?" Sirius cut him off.Remus glared. "I was going to say hurt the mandrake. Besides, can you imagine how much trouble we'd get in? Forget detention! We'd be expelled."Sirius tousled Remus's hair, getting dirt in it. "You don't have to help us.""If I don't help, you'd definitely get caught," Remus grumbled, trying to knock the dirt out of his hair but just ended up rubbing it in more. "No, I'll help if you're that determined.""Thattaboy!" Sirius put his arm around him as he moaned miserably. "Come on, let's get cleaned up.""Can't... I have to meet—Pomfrey soon." He had nearly said Dumbledore, yikes. Remus checked James's watch. They got out a bit early from class but not early enough to make it to the dorms for a shower. He was going to be covered in grime. Great. "I'll see you at lunch." He stopped by one of the bathrooms so he could at least scrub off his hands and face before heading to the gargoyle that guarded Dumbledore's office. There was a clock down the hall which he kept an eye on until sufficient time had passed, then told the gargoyle, "Pepper imps." The gargoyle moved, revealing a staircase. Remus climbed up, feeling nervous, feeling gross for not being able to get clean. He knocked at the door then cautiously opened it when he heard Dumbledore's voice.

As soon as Remus stepped into Professor Dumbledore's office, he knew why he had been called up. He wasn't in trouble at all."Miss Fawley!" His face broke into a grin and he ran over, falling into her open arms as they hugged each other tightly."Remus," she said, squeezing. "It's so good to hear your voice again.""Oh—oh, Miss Fawley, I'm sorry, I got mud all over you!" He pulled back, cringing at the sight of dirt all over her pretty blue robes. "We j-just had Herbology and I—I didn't have time to—""It's fine, they can be cleaned," she laughed. Her hand touched his head gently sending a surge of happiness inside his chest. "How are you doing?""Pretty good. Happy to be in classes again! I got to meet the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher on Sunday and I think he liked me."Fawley nodded, remembering the memories she saw of Dedenne. "I'm glad. Fabian is a good guy.""You know him?""I know his twin brother, Gideon. I've met Fabian once or twice. I hope he proves to be a better teacher than Professor Dedenne, but I believe he will be." She swung her cane around as she went to the nearest couch, sitting down; Remus sat down next to her, pretty much forgetting Dumbledore until then. He was standing by his desk, watching all of this with amused eyes.Seeing Remus's gaze he headed over, sitting in an armchair. "I've brought Mythana here so we can work out which night works best for your Occlumency lessons.""Well. Um. Maybe T-Tuesdays still? Or Thursdays. Tuesdays have my l-least amount of classes," he said. "Thursday is the same except I—I have Astronomy too.""Tuesdays would work out for me as well," she said, tucking some of her long white hair behind her ear. "If you wish we can begin tonight.""That'd be t-terrific." He thought back then frowned, realizing he had been a little rude. "How are you d-doing? I forgot to ask, I'm sorry.""I'm doing well, thank you." Fawley smiled broadly. "Quite excited to begin lessons again. This year will be one of great growth for you, I think. Considering the advances you made last year."Remus beamed until Dumbledore said in a rather grave tone, "There is another issue I wished to discuss with you, Remus. It's about your friends.""I—I'm s-sorry about the—the fight," he said, assuming that's what the headmaster was getting at. "I sh-should have stopped them—""It isn't that." Remus shrank back a little bit, scared of what was going to be said next. "It's what I touched on briefly at the end of last year. I know you are very close with them..." He trailed off then averted his gaze, staring instead at the far wall. And? Remus thought, wishing he'd get on with it. "I urge you to be more careful.""What?" He couldn't believe it! He was being lectured over this again? He looked at Fawley whose smile had disappeared. "Wh—what do you mean?""The closer you are to someone, the easier it will be for them to realize what you're hiding," Dumbledore said carefully. "Don't get me wrong, it is wonderful you have such good friends. I merely wish to remind you caution is important.""Really? I never would have g-guessed," Remus muttered rather bitterly then bit his tongue at what he just told the headmaster! "I'm sorry," he said quickly. "I—I mean, I—I know, I... I am c-c-careful. I promise. Th-they have n-n-nn-no idea." He wrung his hands, wishing he could take back what he had said. All he could do was, "I'm sorry," again."I know you're careful," Dumbledore said, tilting his head forward, looking at Remus over his half-moon spectacles. "Please do not misunderstand what I am saying. I am very glad you have friends, I am very glad they are your friends. You need to have friends. I'm not trying to say you shouldn't. However, it is very easy to let one's guard down with those you care about. If you ever even imagine they're beginning to question, please come to me immediately. I shall keep you safe."Remus swallowed, nodding. "Yes, sir.""They did not find it suspicious when you were cut the other day?""Suspicious?" Remus felt confused again. "Cut?""Your... fight, with the Slytherins. Poppy said you were cut during the fight. Nobody noticed it healing?"Suddenly everything Dumbledore was saying made sense. "Oh!" he breathed out. "No! N-nobody noticed, my—my sh-shirt was cut but it still covered the spot well enough, and—and I bled so—so everyone saw that. I just told them that Madame Pomfrey healed it, they believed that."Dumbledore nodded. "Good, I'm glad. I didn't mean to upset you, it's only incidents such as that can bring about suspicion. That is why I wanted to remind you to be cautious.""I am," he said, calmed down. "I'm v-very careful."Fawley's hand came down on his shoulder. "It'll be fine. You still have that necklace?""Yes, I wear it every day," he promised, hand going to where the pendant hung under his clothes. "They think it's p-pure silver.""Good." She pushed herself up, fingers gripping her cane. "Is six pm still a good time for you?""Yes, ma'am.""Until then."He realized it was a dismissal. He told them both goodbye then scurried out, fingers absentmindedly plucking at the hem of his vest as Dumbledore's words echoed in his head. He hadn't really thought about being cut in front of his friends like that. During his first year there hadn't been any real problems with him getting hurt then healing up suddenly, other than the Quidditch game Madame Hooch had the first years play; but Pomfrey had been on the scene so quickly that it never seemed weird. He really did need to be more careful, especially when it came to injures. Other things he could play off but healing almost instantly... well, he just had to be careful./\/\/\/\/\After the meeting in Dumbledore's office Remus hurried to the Gryffindor tower for a quick shower then ran to the Great Hall to shove some food in his mouth before the bell rang for the next class. He didn't get much food, but it'd be enough. He could sneak into the kitchens after Dark Arts."How did things go with Pomfrey?" Peter asked as they headed to class."Good," Remus muttered. "I need to go see her tonight for a proper checkup. She figured because of my class schedule, Tuesdays would remain the best day for my weekly checkup.""What exactly is this checkup for?" Sirius inquired."Er..." He wracked his brain for memories of what he had told them before. "Blood tests, mostly. A physical. That sort of thing.""What for?" Sirius still pressed.Remus glared up at him through his fringe. "Because I'm sick?"However that didn't deter him. "Yes, but don't your, uh, attacks come on suddenly without much warning?" Sirius stared down into Remus's face. "You usually just wake up exhausted. There isn't medicine or anything, right?""C—correct." Remus ducked his head now, not wanting to see those silver eyes. He then remained silent, hoping Sirius would take that as enough of an answer. He had to deal with this dance the previous term, he didn't want to do it again. Especially not right after Dumbledore's whole be careful of friends lecture.Sirius waited several seconds then realized Remus wasn't going to say anything more. "So, what's the point of the checkups? If there's nothing that can be done in advance, and you don't know when—""Sirius!" James hissed out. "Stop badgering him.""Yeah, it's personal," Peter agreed.Sirius kept his gaze on Remus for a second too long—Remus felt like he might explode—then he smiled, lightly punching Remus's shoulder. "I just worry about you, and don't want you doing more than you have to. Pushing yourself, I mean.""It's okay. I just don't like talking about it.""Yeah..." Sirius hesitated then said, "I shouldn't have pushed."Sirius pretty much never actually said the word 'sorry' so Remus knew that was his version of an apology. "Thank you."The Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom looked quite different than it had for Dedenne. The desks were arranged in a semi-circle around the edges of the room, leaving a huge empty space which had two X marks opposite each other. Normally Remus sat near the front however now there wasn't much of a front. He followed his friends who sat in one of the curves, sitting closest to the teacher. Sirius took the seat next to him. He and James were discussing what the new arrangement might mean but Remus had figured it out."Dueling," he whispered."Ooooh!" Sirius gasped out. He and James high fived each other.Professor Prewett was leaning against his desk, watching everyone come in. Once the last one came in he flicked his wand, shutting the door. He introduced himself, the chalk writing his name on the board behind him. He took a quick roll call then began pacing. "Your previous teacher did a decent job of some of the basics however it's quite obvious she held you back on one of the most important aspects of Defense Against the Dark Arts. The physical aspect of fighting." There was an appreciative sound from the students at that. "I understand you know a few bits and bobs here and there however..." He slammed his hand down against his desk making everyone jump. "Not enough. A lot of magical folk dismiss dueling as a flashy show, entertainment." He shook his head, making a disgusted sound. "It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye, or a limb, or their very life. It isn't just entertainment. It could be a life and death situation. So I will be focusing on teaching you to protect yourselves. Against creatures, but also other people."He walked into the middle of the room. "I'm assuming you lot are much the same as the other second years. You have very little knowledge of proper stances and form, so everyone line up here; let's work on forms first before we go any farther."Prewett spent the first twenty or so minutes having everyone hold their wands out as if they were preparing to duel so he could correct their postures, their forms, the way they stood. "Too open, you're just screaming for a spell to hit your other arm," he told one. "Look at those feet, you'll trip yourself immediately," he told another. For Remus he said, "You're too hunched, stop looking like you want to disappear or someone will make you." Though the best correction was for James. "You're too flashy, this is a duel, not a stage show.""What a git," James grumbled as he took his seat again. "Too flashy. Wanker."Once everyone was done Prewett paired everyone up alphabetically, which put Remus with a virtual stranger, Athena Magpie. A girl of Korean descent who he had been partners with once or twice in their first year however they pretty much never spoke. She hadn't been overly great with spells when they had been paired up in Defense once, though she had clearly gotten better as hers was one of the only stances Prewett hadn't corrected.They didn't stand on the Xs, instead they lined up facing their partners. Since there was an uneven amount, Twycross was put with Struthers and Spinnet; she looked exceedingly displeased by this, face pinched as she stood next to Spinnet who didn't seem all that pleased to have her with them. Remus was on the defensive side so when Prewett said go he put up shields, blocking the spells Magpie sent his way. She had gotten between since the last time they were partners, lips twisted in a smile as his hands whipped about trying to keep her spells off him. He was a little relieved when Prewett said to switch. He wiped some sweat off his forehead."Th—that was b-brilliant," he said.Magpie's cheeks tinted a little. "Thanks," she said shyly.They were told to go again so Remus began sending sparks at her. She blocked most, though a few green sparks landed harmlessly against her uniform. Once they finished with that Magpie told Remus he had done very well to which he gave a shy 'thanks' back. They all stood back as Prewett paced up and down between the lines, eyes narrowed in thought. Finally he got to one end, spinning around to face them all."All right then. While it seems you've got a basic shielding spell down for the most part, I'm a little disappointed in one thing. Anyone tell me what that is?" He surveyed the room however nobody put their hands up, not even Remus who had no clue. "The severe lack of offensive spells. Sparks won't do you good. You should have learned at least a couple other offensive spells in your first year! Nothing major. Yet all you can do is make sparks fly."Remus's stomach dropped. They hadn't been told to use anything more than sparks! Then again they hadn't been told just to use sparks, just 'one side offense, one side defense'."Mr. Potter?" Prewett asked.James lowered his hand. "Sirius, Remus, Pete, and I know a lot more offensive spells, sir.""Could have fooled me," Prewett responded.James didn't seem phased. "Want to see?""All right then, everyone back to your desks. Let's see a proper duel. You said Black, Lupin, and Pettigrew?" Prewett eyed the three of them. "One of you want to d—" Sirius's hand was in the air before he even finished. "Right then, go on. Xs, let's see the duel. Everyone else sit down, Potter and Black are going to show us a duel."There was a lot of snickers and whispers as the students returned to their desks. "Are they nutters?" Peter asked quietly."Yes," Remus replied. "The answer is yes. Always."Sirius and James stood on the Xs, James going right back to the fanciful stance he had before. Prewett put his head in his hands for a second but then told them to begin. Both boys bowed then spells began flying. Students sitting around began putting up their own shielding spells to stop flyaway spells from hitting them. Peter wasn't very good at shields so he huddled up next to Remus who put a spell up to protect them. Both boys held their own fairly well for a few minutes but the spells began piling up until James lost, collapsing on the ground with one leg jellified, one arm jellified, sneezing rose petals while also laughing uproariously from a tickling spell. Sirius was being attacked by a single yet large furry bat-shaped bogey, all of his fingers had been jellified, and his body kept jerking in a strange manner. But he was standing, able to talk, while James wasn't.Prewett clapped. "Very good!" he said then began removing the spells. He had trouble with the furry bat-bogey but with James back to normal he was able to dismiss it, as the caster. "Very impressive, offensively. Would have liked to see more defense there however five points each to Gryffindor." He waved his hand for them to sit and as his eyes swept the room Remus froze, terrified he and Pete would be called up to duel because of what James said about all four of them knowing how to. Prewett's gaze hesitated for a split second on Remus and Peter then he whirled around, going back to the front of the room. "Now that we've cleared that up, anyone else know any offensive spells besides some sparks?"Almost everyone raised their hand and for the rest of the class they watched small duels between nearly everyone. Lily was pitted against Spinnet and wiped the floor with him, which was a terrific thing to watch. The only ones who didn't want to duel were Remus, Pete, and Eloise Nettle who could barely perform a basic shield spell. These were the three that had to remain behind after Prewett let class out early.The three of them stood in front of his desk awkwardly. Pete kept shuffling from foot to foot while Nettle was very determined to get the lens of her glasses cleaned. Remus just stared at the floor."Do none of you know good offense?" Prewett asked."I... I know them, I'm just not good," Nettle mumbled."And you two boys?" Silence. "I'll take that as a no, then. Potter lied? About your... abilities?""Errr..." Pete looked desperately at Remus."I assumed it was a voluntary dueling exercise, n-nn-not mandatory," Remus said swiftly. He didn't want to speak up for himself but he could smell how panicked Pete had gotten and didn't want to leave him floundering.Prewett clasped his hands behind his back, walking over to one of the windows. "I'm not trying to be unreasonable. I'm only trying to teach you, and in order to teach you I need to know what you can do, and go from there. Understand?""Yes, sir," Remus whispered."Let me ask again. Do you know good offense?""I—I... I..." Remus swallowed heavily. "I c-can.""Let's see, then." He flicked his wand causing a training dummy to trundle forward on some wheels. "Not a duel. Just attack the figure.""What... w-would you like to see?"Prewett gave him a rather piqued gaze. "I want to see what you can do, Mr. Lupin."Remus pushed his sleeves up, not sure how some of the spells would work on an inanimate object. Prewett, Peter, and Nettle stood back while Remus began attacking the figure, using all the hexes, jinxes, and curses that he knew... which were quite a lot. He wasn't sure if some of them would even be considered offensive spells, such as the fire spell. He had used it in a fight. It could hurt someone. So it was an offensive spell. He also shot out sticky webbing which was mostly intended to put out the fire however it was also offensive, in his mind. He had to shoot a lot out to get rid of the fire. He used the bat-bogey hex which did nothing. He even used langlock which he couldn't do properly yet, because technically he knew it. He tried advanced spells that he never tried before which drained him being shot out one after another; some of them worked, some of them didn't. He finished with the knockback jinx which sent the battered figure spinning through the air to the other side of the room.Remus swayed then stumbled, nearly falling over. Peter rushed to his side, grabbing hold of him. "Remus!""I'm okay." He leaned into Peter's arm, allowing his friend to help him over to one of the chairs. He was soaked in sweat, breathing hard, and felt dizzy. He felt on the verge of passing out. "Just overdid it."Prewett was staring at the dummy figure then turned to face Remus. "That," he said as he walked over to Remus, "is what I wanted. Twenty points to Gryffindor for that display, Mr. Lupin. I am very impressed. Some of those were spells you wouldn't be learning until your third, or even fourth year." Remus remained silent, mopping up some of his sweat with the sleeves of his robes. "All right, Miss Nettle. Don't look so terrified. I do not expect that from anyone your age. Trust me. It'll be fine."He coaxed some spells from her. They were very lackluster compared to what Remus did which made him feel rather guilty. If he had the presence of mind to cheer her on he would have, which thankfully Pete did. He clapped loudly the rare time her spell succeeded. Then when it was Pete's turn she cheered him on. He managed a few more than her."Thank you," Prewett said, waving his wand to send the dummy back to its corner. "This helps the class, yes? Now I have an idea where most of you are, skill-wise.""Not very far," Peter muttered under his breath.Prewett's eyes narrowed. "Mr. Pettigrew, I have seen adults with less capability of defending themselves, or fighting for themselves. A lot of magical folk graduate assuming they'll never need to know this sort of thing. But with how things seem—" He stopped then rubbed the bridge of his nose. "In any case, don't sell yourself short. You've got a little, and that's good. You'll grow. Now, go on, enjoy your afternoon."Sirius and James were hopping from foot to foot right by the door, while Nettle's friend (Magpie, actually) waited a little farther down the hall. Nettle fled to her while James poked at his friends, wanting to know what happened. Remus explained everything although he didn't say how impressed Prewett had been by him, nor all the spells. But Peter told them, going on with awe at what he had done."That explains why you look so worn out," Sirius said, tousling Remus's sweaty hair. Remus swatted his hand away, wishing Sirius would stop doing that. He didn't do it to James or Peter, just Remus and it drove him nuts, especially since he couldn't figure out why he was the only target, or why it sometimes sent tingles through his body. Probably from irritation."It was embarrassing going after Remus," sighed Peter."You should listen to what Prewett said though," Remus said, trying to smooth his hair back down. "He said he's seen adults who can't do much at all. He said Pete's got some which is good, and he'll get better.""You will get better!" James flung an arm around Pete. "You got loads better over last year. That first battle we ever had you didn't do anything. The one on Sunday you fought. Pretty well, really."Pete slowly smiled. "T... true..."Sirius bumped into him. "We'll help you. We can practice tonight and tomorrow, then Thursday you can show off how awesome you are."Peter looked up at him then at the other two who were nodding encouragingly, and he finally smiled. "Okay."

Author's note: the virus has hit my county so I told my boss I am self quarantining to protect my mom, so there will be an extra chapter out sometime this week! Probably Wednesday. Hope everyone is staying safe!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\After Defense Against the Dark Arts, the four Marauders puttered around trying to figure out what to do when suddenly James snapped his fingers. "We need to make plans. Mandrake plans, I mean.""We need a name for the mandrake plan," Sirius said brightly. Of course as the one in the group who was the worst at naming things he immediately followed up with, "I can pick one—""NO!" All three Marauders shouted.Sirius pouted. "Jerks."James decided that the best thing for their mandrake plot was doing some recon with the greenhouses. They burst outside, nearly crashing into a group of older Gryffindors who began complaining at them being so rowdy."You're why we lose so many points!" one of them said.James spun around, walking backwards, a big grin on his face. "Check the hourglasses, buddy-boy, we got Gryffindor thirty points in one class." He whirled back around, strutting off with his friends following, snickering. Remus glanced over his shoulder, seeing the older Gryffindors scowling. He smiled then hurried forward as they went around the castle towards the greenhouses. There were seven of them, as well as a huge round greenhouse attached to the actual tower.The Marauders sat on and around a large rock several yards away from the greenhouses so they could get a proper lay of the land while looking hopefully casual. There was a large group of Slytherins and Ravenclaws going into Greenhouse Five, none of which seemed to notice them. The way the greenhouses were laid out put Greenhouse Three very close to the wall of the castle. There were windows looking out over the greenhouses but because of how close Three was, it'd be hard for anyone to see anyone going in and out unless they had their faces pressed up against the glass."Are they kept locked?" Peter wondered.They stared at the greenhouses then Remus got up, walking over, ignoring their furious whispers to get back here! He kept going up to the door then cautiously put his hand on the door. He twisted, pushing the door open. He smiled back at his friends then went inside. It was weird being in a greenhouse without the class, without Sprout.A venemous tentacula sat by one end, its vines reaching out towards him. He skirted around one of the table, going deeper in, keeping his eye out for dangerous plants. He had to hop back several times and crashed into a table at trying to avoid a very vicious looking flower trying to spit something at him. Finally he reached the back where the mandrakes were kept.Am I really doing this? he wondered as he approached the tables. He wiped his sweaty palms off on his trousers then took one of the small pots, not even thinking anything else as he slipped it into his bag. Then he saw a shadow outside the greenhouse. Swearing softly, he put the pot back onto the table and quickly left, more sweat soaking into his clothes."What are yeh lot doin' here?"It was Hagrid, surveying the three boys who were standing near the greenhouse now, then at Remus coming out of the greenhouse. The other Marauders looked rather horrified but Remus just smiled, pulling his Herbology book out of his bag."I f-f-forgot this in class t-today," he said, waving the book a little.Hagrid smiled, shaking his head. "Yeh need ta be careful, the greenhouses are dangerous.""I know, I was very c-c-careful. I just d-didn't want to wait until Sp—Sprout was done with her other c-class, since I have an essay t-to do.""All righ' then, back into the castle, all of yeh.""Yes, sir!" James and Sirius chorused, then promised they'd come see him over the weekend. Then all four of them headed back to the castle, Remus in the back, his heart pounding hard in his chest."I found out one thing," he said quietly as they reached the doors. "The pot fits well in my schoolbag. Should be easy to take.""You didn't take it?" James asked incredulously. "You had it right there!"Remus sighed, marveling a little at his friend's stupidity. "No! I didn't know who was outside the greenhouse! Even with lying about my book like that, I'd be the suspect if a plant went missing!"Sirius began nodding. "He's right, he did the right thing. We'll have to use the cloak, I think. That way nobody will see us around there." Then he flashed a grin at Remus. "That was bloody brilliant though. Just walking in, cool as a cucumber. Very impressive."Remus smiled rather shakily, still feeling scared of what could have happened, still feeling scared of what they were intending to do. He hoped to be able to convince them to abandon this plot however figured it wouldn't work. They were determined. So, he'd help them. And hopefully not get caught./\/\/\/\/\The first lesson back with Miss Fawley was a disaster, at least for Remus. He had been able, at the end of his first year, to slightly resist her mental pushing. Not much, just enough for her to notice. However that was completely gone. Plus after only two attempts he had a violent headache again. He wound up crying because he felt so stupid and inadequate. Fawley rested her hand on his shoulder, promising him it was fine, it was to be expected, blah-blah-blah. Remus didn't really pay much attention, he was too furious with himself. Plus she asked him, once, if he was hit over the summer which infuriated him even though he knew she'd probably ask. His parents loved him, they didn't hurt him, and the few times Lyall did physically hit Remus it was for a reason. Discipline. Which Remus deserved. So he lied and said no, hoping she wouldn't see it in his memories the two times Lyall had smacked him during the summer holidays (both of which he probably deserved). Thankfully she didn't as he tried to focus mostly on the past couple days, however he couldn't offer up any sort of fight against her probes into his mind and they wound up cutting the lesson a little short since Remus got so annoyed.He went back to the Gryffindor tower, tugging at the hem of his vest, muttering about how dumb he was. Only two months... only two months! And what tiny progress he made had ebbed away like the tide at the beach. It would come back eventually except what if it just went away? What if it was constantly like a wave? What if he couldn't sustain this much-needed ability? What if one day he met a legilimens who looked into his head and saw him as a wolf?At the tower he struggled getting into the common room since the hole was raised up off the floor. He usually had trouble, quite often falling on his face. Like this time. He got to his feet, rubbing his temples as noise assaulted his sense of hearing. Someone had turned the radio up pretty loud which meant the general chatter was louder than normal too. He trudged across the floor, intending to bury himself in (or under) his bed but in his dorm was also loud music, as well as his friends being quite rowdy. He rather wished he had nicked a pair of those silencing earmuffs from Herbology...That night he had his first real nightmare since arriving back at school. There was music playing, getting louder and louder, irritating him rubbing him the wrong way, pushing him until the wolf burst out of him, going on a rampage to stop the painful sounds. He had just dug his claws into a faceless student when he woke up with loud gasps and shuddering cries, soaked in sweat. He pressed his hands against his face, hoping he hadn't woken Sirius up. He listened carefully for a moment then slid out of bed, quietly padding into the bathroom to wash his face off.When he looked in the mirror he immediately recoiled. He looked worse than he expected. The dark smudges under his eyes looked like bruises, his thin hair clung to his skull from the sweat, and he was definitely pale. His fingers skimmed along his cheekbones, wondering why he looked so awful with being in the middle between the moon phases. Stress? Depression over the whole Occlumency thing? His fingers brushed against the dark circles then he pushed away from the sink, returning to bed. He tossed and turned a lot, taking forever to get back to sleep. He didn't get much sleep at all so was exhausted and extra grouchy throughout Wednesday despite the fact they didn't have class first thing so they were able to sleep in. His friends were able to tell he wasn't in the best of moods so they didn't bother him too much. At lunch Remus slept, not eating anything which didn't help his mood though he did feel more rested. He wound up not eating much at supper, instead he scarfed one sandwich down before going to the library to start working on one of Prewett's essays."You doing all right?" Lily asked when she came in just before six."Huh? Yeah..." Remus rubbed his face, yawning loudly. "I didn't sleep well last night.""You got ink all over your face."He looked at his ink-splotched hands then sighed, shaking his head. "Perfect."Lily sat next to him, noticing the word at the top of his parchment. "Why are you writing an essay about gytrashes? We don't have one like that, do we?""No... it's..." He rolled the parchment up quickly, shoving it into his bag. "It's nothing." He felt a little awkward confessing to her about what Prewett was doing for him, worrying that she'd view it as unfair. He was beginning to think it was completely unfair, feeling rather guilty for this opportunity. "My own thing."Lily rolled her eyes. "Because you're not already the smartest in our year, you have to write essays about things we aren't even learning about." She didn't sound very annoyed at least. More amused than anything else. At least she didn't bring it up in front of the others.That night he stayed up late to finish it, having a good excuse with James and Sirius wanting to explore the school again under James's cloak. This time they invited Peter along. They asked Remus too but Remus declined, stating he wanted to do some homework instead. Sirius called him a nerd before they left.The Marauders returned at around two in the morning however Remus stayed up a little bit later to put the finishing touches on the essay./\/\/\/\/\"Did you get any sleep last night?" Lily asked. It was the next morning and Remus slept through breakfast, jerking awake at her question."A bit...""What did you do?" He just yawned, rubbing at his face, feeling something sticky. He quickly grabbed a napkin to wipe at the jam. "Remus, you still have ink on you. From last night. You didn't get a shower?""I forgot."Lily gave him a scathing look. "What were you even doing?""Homework." He took a bite of his toast though wasn't really tasting it."We don't have that much homework."He didn't reply, just chewed silently. He had a whole month to finish the essays for Professor Prewett so why did he feel the need to finish them as soon as he could? He had four of the ten done, including the hardest one. He'd be able to finish the rest over the weekend. He had hoped to be able to hand in five to Prewett today but four would do. He just... needed to know he could do it. That he wasn't as godawful at Defense Against the Dark Arts as he spent his entire first year thinking. There was something about the curriculum that pulled at him. He had loved the books, just despised the teacher. Maybe with Prewett it'd become one of his favorite classes. Be interesting to see if it beat out Transfiguration, although the main reason Transfiguration was his favorite was because he liked McGonagall so much. If they had a better History teacher, he'd probably like History of Magic the most."Remus!" He jumped at Lily's voice. "It's time for class," she said.He looked at his hand, at the half-eaten toast. He just dropped it onto his plate, wiped his mouth off, and followed his friends outside to the greenhouses. He felt rather guilty as they went in, as if Sprout could guess he had been snooping around the other day however she just went into their lesson which had nothing to do with mandrakes but Remus was on edge the entire time, knowing it was going to be worse after they actually stole the plant./\/\/\/\/\Defense Against the Dark Arts had a lecture from Prewett about a variety of creatures, then he tested out their skills much like he had Remus, Peter, and Nettle. Only this time he told them what spells to use on the dummy. He went alphabetical order, so Sirius went first who did well over half the spells with ease, a handful of them with trouble, and a few of them he couldn't do at all. Once he finished Prewett let him leave early. Colgate went next, then Inkwood, then Remus who did every spell although some of them took some effort.Remus left class, relieved to see Sirius waiting. Soon Magpie left, McNab, Nettle, then finally Peter came out."How'd you do?" Remus asked."N—not that bad actually," Peter admitted. "I was able to do seven of the spells.""Hey, not bad!" Sirius said, holding up a hand for a high five which Peter gladly gave.James soon strutted out, suggesting they go do some pranks on someone but Remus mumbled that he needed to talk to Prewett. "About what?" James asked."Stuff," Remus said, fiddling with his sleeve. "I'll catch up with you.""We'll wait with you," Sirius said."You d-don't need to!" Remus protested."We don't mind," Peter said brightly, the others agreeing. They sat down on the bench across from the classroom door, passing the time by naming spells they knew alphabetically. James said a spell, then Sirius, then Peter, then Remus, then back to James, all of them trying to go as fast as they could. Sirius was trying to think of J spell when Spinnet came out, eyeing the four of them suspiciously."Jelly-legs curse," Sirius said and Spinnet quickly retreated."That's not the spell itself, you lose," James laughed."Aw come on, I can't think of any J spells!" Sirius protested. "I bet there's none!""Jubilius," Remus said rather lazily.Sirius narrowed his eyes. "That's not a spell."Remus pulled his wand out of his pocket. "Want me to prove it? It's a spell that makes you happy. Jubilee.""Hmph. This is a dumb game.""What about K?" Peter inquired.They all looked at Remus who ducked his head. "Klackum. Makes your shoes noisy.""Yeahhhh there's no point playing this against Remus, he'd win every time," James said."Brains," added Sirius, smiling though.Struthers came out a few minutes later then finally Twycross who, like Spinnet, looked suspicious at the Marauders just sitting there. Remus hopped up, knocking at the door, going in at Professor Prewett's voice.He was putting the dummy back in its corner. "Ah, Mr. Lupin, can I help you?""I—wanted t-to turn these in," Remus said, fumbling for the four rolls of parchment. Prewett accepted them with a frown. "The, um, essays. F—four of them, I'll—I'll have the r-rest by Tuesday, I expect.""Didn't I say you have until the end of the month?" Prewett asked.Remus looked at his feet. "You d-did. But I got those done. I, er, f-figured I might as well hand them in. Haveagoodday!" He rushed out of the classroom, a touch afraid he'd be lectured for handing them in so quickly due to the fact Prewett's brow was furrowed pretty deeply. As soon as his friends saw him going so quickly they immediately jumped up, hurrying along with him, wanting to know if he had done something to cause trouble. "No," Remus said as he slowed down. "I just worried I annoyed him.""Just because Dedenne didn't like you doesn't mean he does," James said, assuming that's what was going on. "He doesn't know your father, does he?""No..." Remus wasn't sure whether or not to tell them about this. Finally he decided to share. "I saw him on Sunday.""You never told us!" Peter squeaked."I—I wasn't sure whether or not to do so," Remus confessed, guilt eating away as three sets of eyes bore into him. "It was about my grades from last year. It... it embarrasses me. He—he t-talked to me about—well, he offered me a chance to change my grades from last year.""WHAT?!" All three of them spun around to gape at him openly now.Remus felt increasingly uncomfortable. Perhaps he shouldn't have spoken, kept this inside. "He knew it w-was unfair. How she treated me. Um, graded me. He g-got permission from D—Dumbledore to offer me an opportunity to make up for them. That's wh—why I've been doing so much homework, he assigned me some essays to do this month." As he spoke he thought it wasn't fair. Pete didn't get good grades in this class yet he wasn't being offered this. Ugh, he shouldn't have said anything!All three of them spoke at the same time. "That's great!" from Sirius, "Merlin, that's awesome!" from James, and, "Wow, that's so nice of them!" from Pete.They all pat his shoulders, congratulating him, none of them sounding bitter about this event which sent relief flooding through Remus's body. Even Peter was grinning. Actually, so broadly that Remus realized one of his teeth was missing. Remus mentioned this and Peter replied it had been his last baby tooth."I feel so dumb for still having one," he admitted."My brother still has two," Sirius said which cheered Pete up. "I only just lost the last of mine about a year ago.""I still have one!" James said, opening his mouth wide to point at one of his teeth."I l—lost mine a while ago," Remus said, awkward since he suspected the reason his had fallen out so early was due to the wolf, and the stress his teeth went through transforming each month. Luckily his adult teeth had grown in pretty quick afterwards which was also probably due to the whole werewolf thing—regeneration, and all that.James began poking at his baby tooth then stopped, squinting suddenly at Remus. "Wait, if he gave you all month why have you been obsessing on getting them done so quick?"Remus just shrugged. "I wanted to.""Nerd," Sirius said. "You looked awful yesterday, though. Don't overdo it.""I won't," Remus promised."Hey! Potter!" a voice called from down the hall. A group of older Gryffindors. Remus tensed up, expecting a fight, then realized it was the Quidditch girl. Bell. She approached their group, eyes sparkling. "Saturday at ten?""On the dot!" James replied excitedly. "Are there a lot of signups? I haven't checked."Remus pressed his lips thin, trying not to snort. That was a rampant lie. He knew for a fact that James checked the piece of parchment in the common room at least three times a day, making comments about those who had put their names down."We've got about a dozen right now," Bell replied, "and I figure if it goes at this rate probably at least four more before Saturday, likely more." She glanced at her group of friends then bent in. "None as good as you, though."Remus swore he could see James's head inflating. "Yeah well," James said, trying to sound modest as he mussed his hair up. "I guess we'll find out for sure Saturday!"The fifth years headed one direction while the second years headed another, James swaggering quite a bit. A tiny part of Remus hoped there'd be some good competition just to knock him down a peg however, despite his lack of Quidditch knowledge, he did know that James was really, really, really good. He had read the book James gave him for his birthday (Quidditch Through The Ages) but it hadn't really soaked into his brain much. James's tryouts would be the first time really watching anything Quidditch-related. He'd probably wind up going to some practices, and of course the three games. He sighed a little as they walked, hoping the games wouldn't happen at the same time a full moon was going. He knew James would understand him being sick... he just didn't want to draw so much attention to him not being there./\/\/\/\/\The Marauders' plan to steal the mandrake that afternoon was dashed when they went outside to find the door wide open and several older students inside tending some plants, badges on their robes proclaiming they were from the Herbology club. The boys quickly returned to the castle, hoping they'd have time to next day. Peter suggested during lunch but James shot that down, insisting he wanted to try the broom-up-the-girls-stairs thing during that time."Why not during supper tonight?" Pete asked."More students likely to be at lunch than supper," James pointed out, ending the short discussion.They were just about to go up a flight of stairs when they were stopped by a voice again, this one younger, this one calling out for Sirius. They turned to see Regulus coming towards them. A brief smile flickered on Sirius's face before it went neutral."Heya," Sirius said, running his fingers through his hair. "How's it going?"Regulus eyed the other three then averted his gaze to the floor. "May we speak alone?""Al—? Sure. Uh, yeah, come on." They traipsed off towards a side corridor where Remus could still hear their murmurs. Not all of the words, just a few snatches here and there. Remus, Peter, and James sat on the stairs waiting for Sirius while Remus tried his best not to listen in. It had something to do with the fight on Sunday, with Snape, Wicket, and Fox. There was something about 'mother' which caused Sirius to say 'bollocks to her' and Regulus to snap back at him to 'stop with that attitude'. Their voices raised and judging by James and Peter's faces, they could hear some of it too."I'll stop when she stops!" Sirius snarled out."I'm only trying to HELP!" Regulus snapped back.Peter coughed, turning away, face going red. James jumped to his feet. "Let's wait at the top of the stairs," he suggested then without waiting seized Peter's shirt and Remus's shirt, yanking them to their feet. They clamored up the steps, but Remus could still hear the two brothers arguing. He wanted to put his hands over his ears however since the other two couldn't hear anymore he didn't want them to know he could. Regulus informed Sirius that he was 'only hurting himself' then Sirius said something that made Remus's blood run cold."Wow! All this time I thought it was them hexing me but it's been myself all along! Congratulations, Reg, on figuring it out!"What did that mean? Surely he didn't mean... he couldn't mean... Did Sirius's parents... hex... him...? Hurt him?"You don't have to be such a—a—a brat!" Regulus squeaked. "I'm only wanting to help you!""And you don't have to be such a boot licker but here we are."Remus cringed back as Sirius appeared in the hall, storming up the stairs, face white with fury. Regulus stepped out of the side corridor, face also white, staring at Sirius's back. His eyes met Remus's gaze, some pink appearing in his cheeks as he quickly spun around, fleeing the other direction."Everything okay?" James asked having not heard those last bits."Dandy," Sirius growled, tugging at his tie, undoing it, ripping it off. "C'mon, let's go" He continued on without even waiting, leaving his friends to scramble after him.Remus stumbled along, cold dread trickling through his body, confusion clouding his head. He wanted to vomit. It wasn't hard evidence but—but—now he truly did suspect that Sirius was being what Fawley accused Remus of being. Hurt, by his parents. Physically hurt. That's what he alluded to, right? His head ached trying to sort through this new information. If it was true, what did he do about it? Maybe it wasn't true? Maybe it was a misunderstanding? Like with Fawley, and Remus's father disciplining him. Maybe Sirius just meant hexing him metaphorically? Maybe he meant—he couldn't—Remus clutched his stomach, knowing asking Sirius would end in a disaster, wishing he had the courage to do so.

Remus spent the rest of Thursday feeling a mixture of sick and self hatred. Every time he looked at Sirius his stomach lurched again. He was also quite confused until finally he convinced himself that he just misunderstood, just like Fawley. Sirius's parents may have been crazy but it couldn't be... that bad... could it? Sirius was so vibrant, noisy, everywhere, and if he were being hurt he'd be different, wouldn't he? Finally he just buried himself into denial. It couldn't be that bad. A tiny voice inside of him kept insisting it could be but he just did his best to ignore it, for now. Besides, he didn't have any evidence. Just thoughts, possibilities, and Sirius saying something that could be taken a different way.Sirius grumbled around the dorm for a while after his fight with Regulus until he finally calmed down, returning to his usual smiling self, full of energy and unable to take any kind of nap before Astronomy. Spinnet finally threatened them until James, Sirius, and Peter tumbled down to the common room to hang out. Remus was too tired to join them, curling up in his bed for some sleep. It didn't work too well since he had low grade nightmares of Sirius being hurt which caused his sleep to be fitful, though at least he didn't scream.The first class of Astronomy went well since the moon wasn't visible one bit, not even a sliver. Remus could feel it in the sky but he couldn't see it while looking at the tapestry of stars. Now that was perfect. He loved new moons, he loved being able to do this without a visual reminder of his hell.Two weeks, he thought as he began charting out some of the stars. His drawing was horrible. Making a noise of disgust he crumpled the parchment up then tried again though it wasn't much better. He couldn't help but glance sideways at Sirius's chart. He was barely doing any of the work (instead whispering jokes with James) but what he did have was beautiful. He's so good at art, Remus thought a little jealously. At least I'm not as bad as James though./\/\/\/\/\Fridays were as busy as Mondays, with Potions first, so by the time detention rolled around Remus was pretty tired. He miserably followed his friends to the owlery, hoping they wouldn't be doing what he thought they'd be doing. Which turned out to be yes, that's what they were doing: cleaning. Surprisingly, though, it was a student in charge of their detention, a seventh year who worked in the owlery often since she wanted to work in the post office after graduation. They were given buckets, scrub brushes, brooms, pans, everything they needed. The buckets were enchanted to float alongside them so when one of them needed to climb up the ladders it would follow."Does it matter which one of us cleans the top cubbies?" Sirius asked. The seventh year shook her head. "Okay..." He turned around. "Cause I know you have problems with heights sometimes," he said to Remus who felt rather warmed by Sirius considering him like that."I don't mind doing the top ones," James said."Okay. We can take care of the nests, Remy can do the floors," Sirius suggested.The lowest homes were a little above head height for Remus so there wasn't much point in him helping the others with the owl nests. That was fine for him since the owls hated him, sensing the beast lurking beneath the surface.The first thing they all needed to do, though, was reassure their owls they didn't need them. All four owls fluttered down, assuming their owners needed to send something off. Arthur crashed into Remus who nearly tumbled over in a whirl of feathers and talons. "Hey, hey, you all right?" He got Arthur settled on his arm, heart sinking to see that he had lost some more feathers. He looked so old. "You're okay," he said, nuzzling his owl. "I don't need any letters sent off."The previous year he and his mother had been sending letters back and forth constantly. But they all knew Arthur wasn't really up to so many trips. Hope reluctantly agreed to lessen the post between them. So far he only had one letter from her (mostly her being VERY furious he had gotten detention, furious he had gotten 'dragged into it', and reminding him he needed to lay low and not get involved in anything)."Hey! STOP IT! Oi! Fili! Stooop!" Sirius complained as his insane owl kept trying to attack poor Cocoa, Peter's owl. Filibuster hissed then flew out the window, probably swearing in owl language."Your owl's nuts, mate," James said, grinning broadly.Sirius plucked a feather out of his hair. "Yeah, yeah," he grumbled."Like owner, like pet?" Peter laughed. Sirius stuck his tongue out but looked quite amused."Well, Cocoa has the sweetest disposition, so it fits," Remus said which made Peter blush. "And Godric's the most pompous.""HEY!" James complained."Arthur definitely pushes himself more than he should, so that fits too," said Sirius. Now Remus stuck his tongue out then returned to stroking Arthur's head.Once all their owls were satisfied with the attention (minus Filibuster who was long gone) the four boys began cleaning. James, Sirius, and Peter began cleaning the top ones while Remus worked at scrubbing off the many perches scattered around the room. He couldn't properly do the floors until they were done with the nests so he steeled himself to go up a ladder. Not all the way to the top but he did work on the lower ones, underneath the ones his friends had cleaned. It really wasn't so bad and he was able to work with only a little bit of dizziness."Why do they always make us clean the Muggle way?" Sirius complained eventually."Probably to build character or something," replied James with a snort."If we could use magic it'd not really be a detention," Pete pointed out.Other students came and went, sending mail off with their owls. A couple Slytherins came in at one point, making threats if the Gryffindors did anything to their birds."Maybe you're crazy enough to hurt an innocent pet, but we're not," Sirius called down as the Slytherins left.It took them ages to clean out the owlery, even with all four of them working hard. By the time they finished they were tired, covered in grossness, and Remus thought his arms might fall off. He couldn't imagine how the others felt. They miserably plodded back to the Gryffindor tower, getting into trouble with a prefect for being out well after curfew (it was nearly ten) until James showed him their detention slip. The prefect eyed in carefully as if suspecting it might be fake then waved them on.They all took super long showers (listening to music as they cleaned themselves off, as James brought his phonograph in to play in the bathroom). Remus was the first one out, Sirius the last. Since it was Friday night they didn't really need to hurry to bed and in fact after they all got into their pajamas they just went down into the common room. There were still quite a few students milling about, all of them sixth or seventh years. The four Marauders plopped down on one of the comfiest couches, playing cards until well after all the other students disappeared up to their dorms. It was nearly two before they finally crawled into their beds.Remus was beyond exhausted and slept completely soundly until someone shook him violently awake. He yelped in fear, sitting upright, nearly banging into James."Come on, sleepyhead!" he said brightly, too brightly for what felt like an ungodly hour. Remus's eyes flickered to the clock. Eight-forty-five."S'only been like, six hours," Remus moaned, flopping back, yanking his covers back over his head.James climbed onto the bed and began jumping on it. "Wake UP! Wake UP! Wake UP! You PROMISED!""Promised what!?" Remus wailed, burrowing his head under his pillow as his body was bounced around.James fell next to him, pulling the covers back, yanking the pillow away. "Tryouts," he said, wrapping his arms around Remus which sent a shock of terror through his body at being hugged like this, so closely, and in bed. "You promised.""Th-that's not t-till ten!" Remus squeaked."I wanna be there at nine-thirty, and we need brekkie and—and mental preparation." James let go of him, climbing over him to get out of bed instead of just getting out the other side, limbs thwacking against Remus who debated whether or not he could get away with murder. "Sirius'n'Pete are up.""Why did you want to stay up so late if we couldn't sleep in?" Remus sat up, swinging his legs off the mattress, slipping his feet into his worn out slippers. He had forgotten completely about tryouts the night before. James had been the one urging his friends to stay up so late.James laughed. "Because I couldn't sleep, silly. I didn't get to sleep until nearly four." He began bouncing lightly on the balls of his feet. "Come on. Hurry up."Remus grouchily got ready for the day, going too slow for James's liking. Luckily they had showers the night before so he didn't need to take one. He brushed his teeth, his hair, washed his face off, then got dressed. One of his many pairs of battered jeans and a long-sleeved red shirt. When he went back into the dorm James gave an annoyed sound."No!" James said. "I got you this."He handed fabric to Remus. A t-shirt. It would have fit him perfectly, which meant he couldn't wear it. His scar would only just barely be covered, part of it peeking out. "It's too chilly for a t-shirt.""Not really," Sirius said. He was wearing the t-shirt. It was crimson, with a big gold J on the front. Peter had an identical one. "It's a little chilly but it'd be fine wearing a t-shirt."Remus fingered the shirt in his hands. "All right, j—just a moment."He dug through his things to find a long-sleeved yellow shirt. He went back to the bathroom to put the yellow shirt on, then the J t-shirt over. It was strange wearing a brand new article of clothing that fit him so well. "Better?" he asked when he went back."I guess," James said. "Now let's go."Sirius grabbed a bundle of fabric, carrying it down to the Great Hall. He, Peter, and Remus all ate while James poked at his food, too excited to eat. He managed to get some food down though not much. He kept jiggling, casting anxious looks down the table towards Bell and the rest of the Quidditch team. At nine-thirty the Marauders went out to the Quidditch pitch. It was a little chilly, in Remus's opinion, but Sirius and Peter didn't say anything. They sat in the bleachers to wait for a whole bloody half hour. Remus pulled a book out to read, yawning several times, wishing he was back in bed.Eventually more students filed into the stadium as well as the Gryffindor team."Good luck, mate," Sirius said, giving James a hearty hug."Not that you need it," laughed Pete.James bolted down the stairs, joining the group of those trying out. Sirius unfurled the fabric he brought, revealing a large red-and-gold banner. James Potter: Quaffle King! with well done lions rampant on either side, facing the words. He wheedled Remus until he made the letters flash and glow, then Remus returned to his book."Aren't you going to watch?" Peter asked, poking at Remus's shoulder."I will when James goes," he replied.Since Bell was a new Captain that meant the old team members had to tryout as well. First were the Seekers, there were only a couple of those including the one who had been on the team previously—clearly the best. Then the Beaters tried out, finally the Chasers and Keepers at the same time, in groups. James was in the third group."POTTER! POTTER! POTTER!" Sirius and Peter chanted as James flew into the air.Remus closed his book, standing up to watch. Bell threw the ball, and the Chasers began. In a normal game they'd be working together however this time they were independent. A fifth year got the Quaffle forth, heading towards one of the hoops. James was flying underneath while the third year in the group was buzzing around the fifth year, trying to get the ball. The fifth year threw the ball towards the hoop and James suddenly shot up, grabbing the ball and flying upside down high above the other players. The two other wannabe-Chasers took off after him. James did a barrel spin to right himself then suddenly dropped down, well below the other Chasers who had been climbing upward. There was a collective gasp from most the spectators at the drop."Idiot!" Sirius shouted. "YOU IDIOT!""What happened?" Remus asked as the other two Chasers dove down, and James went back up."He didn't dive, he just stopped his broom to drop," Sirius explained, not taking his eyes off their friend who threw the Quaffle. The Keeper trying out missed the ball, and James got a score. "It's very dangerous.""But cool," Peter breathed out, eyes huge."Stupid," Sirius growled then, after a second or two, "but yeah kinda cool."Remus watched James as the tryout proceeded, constantly needing to ask his friends what was going on. Sirius and Pete did their best to keep him educated, explaining some of the tricks James performed. James scored again, and again, and again. He didn't always have the Quaffle, but almost always ended up with it. He was faster, more agile than the other two Chasers. By the time Bell blew her whistle it was clear who had won that.Bell announced who would be continuing on. Two Keepers, four beaters, and six Chasers for the final round of tryouts. "Continuing on with tryouts for Chaser," Bell said loudly, her voice echoing across the pitch, "Burrowall, Cinderash, Howell, Kirke, Litten..."Sirius, Peter, and Remus all leaned forward. Remus clutched the railing."...and Potter."Of course.This was going to be somewhat of a regular game. The hopeful team members were split up into two teams, minus the Seekers, then the round began. Again, Sirius and Pete explained things to Remus though by now he had a little bit of a grasp on what was going on. Now James was working with a team, and he didn't have the ball as often. He got the Quaffle quite a bit however passed it to his teammates whenever needed. He did score most the points for his team though.It was around one in the afternoon when Bell ended the 'game'. "All right, everyone! The list will be posted on the notice board tomorrow!" Bell said.There were loud groans. "How come we can't know now?" demanded one of the ones who had tried out for Chaser."Because I need to think," Bell snapped right back. "If you don't like it, you can lump it. Dismissed!"Sirius, Peter, and Remus filed down to the pitch to meet up with a sweaty, tired James. "You think I did well?" he asked as soon as they approached him. "I don't know if I did. I missed a few goals, and—""You did brilliant!" Sirius said, wrapping an arm around James's shoulders. "Absolutely brilliant.""If they don't put you on the team, they're mental," Peter said, clapping his hands. "I never realized how good you were at Quidditch! I mean, I've seen you fly but this—wow, just wow!"James beamed, eyes sliding to Remus who was rather uneasy from the fact James still had a hold on his broom, the silver flashing in the afternoon light. "Um, I really don't know much but it seems like you did well," he muttered. "You made the most goals out of all those trying out for Chaser.""Ugh, I'm going to die before tomorrow morning!" James moaned as he thankfully put away his broom. "Simply die!""Rest in peace," Remus said. James glared as his carrying case snapped shut. Remus smiled sweetly in return. "Let's go, I'm starving.""I'm starving," James said as they headed to the castle. "I barely ate anything."James was a mess the rest of the day. He was jittery, on edge, stared at Bell whenever they happened to be in the same room, paced a lot, tugged at his hair, groaned about his misses, and pretty much drove his friends crazy. After Remus sent his letter home off with Arthur, he disappeared into the library just before supper because he couldn't take another second, staying in there working on Prewett's essays until curfew (which, for second years, was extended to eight pm). Peter actually joined him after supper, complaining that James hadn't calmed down one bit."We all know he made it," he sighed as he stared at a blank piece of parchment. "Except for him.""I'll eat my hat if he's not on the team," said Remus.Pete laughed quietly. "I almost wish he doesn't make it, just to see that!"At seven-forty-five the two boys reluctantly headed back to the tower where they found James pacing in the dorm while Sirius flipped through a magazine. James kept pacing even after Remus tried putting on some music, even after Peter started a card game, even after Sirius threatened to beat James over the head with his broom."How am I supposed to sleep tonight?!" James demanded at one point."Want me to get some sleep potion from Pomfrey?" Remus asked.James froze, obviously contemplating that. "No," he finally said, sitting down on his bed. "I want to wake up early.""You're gonna wake us up, aren't you?" Pete asked.James narrowed his eyes. "Don't you want to see as soon as Bell posts the list?""Of course we do," Sirius said quickly. "We'll be there with you." He turned his head so James couldn't see his face as he stuck his tongue out and crossed his eyes. Remus and Pete stifled giggles.They stayed up late again, going down into the common room eventually so they wouldn't bother Spinnet and Struthers. James was really wound up, still having a difficult time sitting down so they played charades for a while. That helped burn off some of James's energy. Then Peter suggested they do some invisible exploring which James leapt at. He ran up the stairs, returning with his cloak."You coming with us tonight, Remus?" he asked."N... no, I'll stay and keep watch," he said."Want me to stay with you?" Sirius offered."Er, no, that's fine," he said as James handed him his watch. "I'm just really tired."Indeed he fell asleep shortly after they left, the watch beeping him awake every ten minutes. This time they didn't all get to bed until around three in the morning, an hour later than the night before. Remus had one of his awful headaches as he collapsed into bed, grumbling to himself as he drifted into sleep... and being awoken only a couple hours later.I'm going to murder him, Remus decided as he threw clean clothes on, glaring at James. Sirius and Peter were both scowling, not that James seemed to notice."It's... seven in the bloody morning," Sirius growled as they went down the stairs. "You think she's going to post it this early?""She might," James protested as he threw himself into an armchair that was across the floor from the notice board. There were papers all over, most of them advertisements for clubs, one long bit of parchment stating the rules, a few mentioning lost items or requests.Peter curled up on a couch next to Remus. "James, come on, you're on the team," he said rather sleepily. Remus slid down, too tired to care of how close they were, of the fact their shoulders were bumped up against one another, that his head drooped down onto Peter's shoulder. He fell asleep. He slept on and off over the next hour until just after eight, when Patricia Bell came down the stairs."Waiting?" she asked, grinning at James."Not really," he replied, trying—and failing—to sound casual.Bell just shook her head then put the parchment up on the center of the board. Remus realized there were several other wannabe-Quidditch members waiting too. James stayed seated. Bell finished with the sticking spell then walked off as the other five people converged on the notice board. James slowly stood up, wiping his hands off on his jeans. Sirius gave him a thumbs up."This is RIDICULOUS!" shouted one of the older boys looking at the notice. "That's bollocks!"James edged his way to the notice, staring up at the paper. Remus waited for a reaction, which didn't happen right away. Then James turned to face his friends, raising his eyebrows, then a grin spread across his face."I made the team!" he said, jumping in the air, fists punching up."YES!" Sirius threw himself at his friend, wrapping his arms around him in a hug. They spun for a second then high fived each other.The older student who was expressing his anger went quiet, glaring at James. "It's not fair," he said darkly. "You're only a second year. You should be a reserve. BELL!" He stomped over to Bell who just folded her arms. "Why is he on the team?" He pointed at James who was now being high fived by Peter and Remus as they gave their congratulations. "He should be a reserve, not fully on the team! He's only a second year!""He's a damn good Chaser, that's what he is," Bell replied."Aw, c'mon, Kirke, no hard feelings?" James asked brightly. "You're on the team too."The older boy clenched his teeth. "I'm a reserve, that's not the team!" He looked like he wanted to wallop James, smelled like he was about to explode with fury. Remus felt a little afraid. "Twelve year olds shouldn't be on the team!""Kirke, calm down," Bell said in a tight voice. "Potter was simply the best who tried out for Chaser. You did terrific too, that's why you're a reserve—""Twelve year olds shouldn't be on the team!" Kirke snapped violently. The common room had fallen quiet, watching this exchange with interest, though since it was so early in the morning for a Sunday there weren't many witnesses. "How is it FAIR?! How would you feel if you were shunted aside for a little child?!"Bell jerked her chin up, eyes flashing. "I am willing to admit that he's a more natural Chaser than myself."James grinned so broadly it had to hurt. Kirke still looked rather murderous. Everyone waited, to see what he would do next. Kirke stood there staring at James for several seconds of tense silence before he stormed off, leaving the common room. Remus let out a quiet, relieved breath of air."You all right?" Bell asked, coming closer to James."I'm great!" he promised. "I can't believe I'm on the team!"Bell rolled her eyes. "Puh-lease, you don't need to bother with that."James scuffed the toe of his sneaker against the floor. "Yeah, well."Bell thumped his shoulder. "See you at the meeting tomorrow." She smiled at his three friends then walked off.James spun around to face them again. "I have to go write my parents right now. I'll see you guys at breakfast!" He took off sprinting out of the common room.Sirius folded his hands under his chin. "I'm happy for him, but Merlin is he going to be insufferable now." He sighed then gave a helpless sort of shrug. "C'mon then, Marauders. Let's get some much needed breakfast."

As of Sunday night the Marauders still hadn't attempted the test to see if flying on a broom would allow them up the girls' staircase since every time they tried the common room had too many students around, so they threw out the idea of doing it during the day and decided to try it at night. Remus didn't particularly feel comfortable with this however he was outvoted."It'll be fine," James said as they crept down the stairs well after midnight (which would have been worse if Remus, Sirius, and Peter hadn't gotten plenty of sleep in the afternoon!). He had his broom in one hand, his invisibility cloak in the other. Sirius went ahead to make sure nobody else was staying up and beckoned for them, indicating they were in the clear."It won't," Remus said, curling his fingers into fists, pressing them against his thighs.Sirius ran his fingers through his hair. "Look, most likely it's the stairs enchanted, you said so yourself. Are you second guessing yourself now?"Remus glowered. "You've overlooked the important part of that statement. 'Most likely' isn't a hundred percent."James pointed the end of his broom at Remus who shuddered from the silver. "It's a lot more of a chance than a hundred percent failure, and we won't know till we try.""Either way, we should not be down here," Remus said. James began glaring again. "I meant us." He indicated Sirius, Pete, and himself. "When—er, if the alarm goes off...""Oh. Right." James frowned as he mounted his broom. "After you guys make sure I'm invisible you should go up the stairs. I'll count to thirty."Sirius put the cloak around James and his broom, adjusting it so nothing was showing until James flew upwards. If they looked up they could see everything, but James said he'd be careful. Sirius, Peter, and Remus went back up the stairs, back into their dorm. Remus sat on the edge of his bed, heart pounding as he waited. Would it work?Then his brain clicked on to a realization. Something he had stupidly overlooked. If the alarm goes off and wakes everyone up, James won't be here, it'll be obvious who was trying! He jumped to his feet, rushing to the door, hoping that for some reason James was still counting. As soon as his hand went on the knob the alarm went off.Remus cried out, hands going to his ears. The alarm wasn't as loud up in the tower as it had been in the common room however it was loud enough to bother Remus's ears as well as wake up Spinnet and Struthers (and everyone else). Struthers woke up with a noise of confused exclamation while Spinnet fell out of bed, getting tangled in his blankets."What the hell?!" Spinnet half-shouted as he got to his feet."That's the girls' stair alarm," Struthers said, getting out of bed, rubbing his eyes."Who's stupid enough to try sneaking up in the middle of the night?!" Spinnet growled then his eyes snapped immediately to Sirius's bed. Sirius waved cheerfully at him. Then his eyes went to James's obviously empty bed. "Where's Potter?""Bathroom," Sirius replied immediately.There were voices out in the hall, other boys shouting to be heard over the klaxon sound. Spinnet shoved past Remus (nearly knocking him to the ground) to open their door, going out. Struthers followed, then the three Marauders. All along the staircase boys were pouring out of their dorms, the prefects pushing their way through to make it to the common room. Everyone followed, curious to see who had done it.Remus, Sirius, and Peter reached the bottom of the steps, mingling in with the crowd which included girls. The same thing was being shouted back and forth between everybody."The stairs didn't turn into a slide!"Remus looked over at the girls' stairs. They were still stairs, and girls were coming down them in confusion. Remus then glanced upwards as casually as he could, trying to see if James was maybe hovering above them."Who did it?""Why are they still steps?""What happened?!"They were still standing around in bewilderment when the portrait opened, and a prefect came in with McGonagall in tow. She is covered head to toe in tartan, Remus thought, remembering something James and Sirius told him in their first year."What in Godric's name is going on?!" their Head demanded, storming to the stairs, flicking her wand. The alarm sound stopped. "Who tried to go up to the girls' dorms?" she asked, surveying the room. Nobody said anything. "Also, how on earth did you manage to prevent the stairs from smoothing out?" Still nothing.Remus chewed his bottom lip, tugging at the end of his pajama sleeves, then suddenly went flush with embarrassment. He was in his raggedy pajamas in front of everyone, though of course no one was looking at him he still felt awkward."Mr. Spinnet?" McGonagall asked and the room turned to stare at Spinnet who was standing on an armchair with his hand raised to be seen above the heads of the older students."Potter's missing," he said with a disgustingly smug smile.Okay, now everyone was looking at Remus in his raggedy pajamas, and Sirius and Peter. Remus took a step closer to Sirius without even thinking about it."He's in the bathroom," Sirius said, slightly hesitantly."With that sound going off?" someone asked.Sirius shrugged. "He was getting a shower. Would you jump out of the shower starkers to run down here?"McGonagall pushed her way through the crowd, face white, lips thin. "Mr. Black," she whispered furiously, "where is Mr. Potter?""I told you," Sirius said, trying to keep the innocent expression."Wouldn't he have had time to dry off and put something on?" another student asked.McGonagall took Sirius by the wrist, marching him up the boys' stairs. "We'll see about this," she said.Remus and Peter were pushed forward as the crowd jostled to get closer to the bottom of the stairs. Peter was tugging hard at Remus's sleeve, making tiny whimpering sounds. Remus began chewing at his nails, knowing James was going to be in a crap ton of trouble, terrified James was just gonna be kicked off the team the day he joined! There were whispers all around him, talking about James. Lily wriggled her way through the crowd, wrapping her bathrobe tighter around her as she reached the boys."Did he do this?!" she demanded furiously, grabbing Remus's arm. "Was Potter trying to sneak into our dorm?!"Remus knew perfectly well the entire Gryffindor student body was listening to him right now which made him shake, feel sick, mentally curse James for doing this to him. "N-n—nnn-no!" he managed to get out, mustering all the honesty he could. It was the truth. James wasn't trying to sneak into their dorm, he was just seeing if flying worked."Then where is he? He's never far from Black," she accused. Remus just mumbled, no idea how to answer. Lily folded her arms. "I see. He did do it." She made a disgusted sound while several of the girls began complaining about the invasion.Then everyone went silent again as they could hear footsteps coming down the stairs. Remus's eyes went wide as McGonagall appeared with Sirius and James behind her, James with wet hair and a bathrobe on. The common room burst into loud whispers. Lily looked absolutely shell shocked, jaw hanging open. It would have been hilarious, if the moment wasn't still so tense."All this fuss over a shower!" James said when he noticed everyone looking at him. He tightened the robe around himself. "For Merlin's sake."McGonagall returned to the center of the common room while James and Sirius bunched up with Peter and Remus. Remus could hear James's heart pounding so fast, his breathing a little heavy as he labored to keep it under control. McGonagall spoke again about how whoever did it needed to come forward, or if anyone knew who did do it to please come forward. She was extremely disappointed in her male students, and removed fifty points from Gryffindor."Which, if the person who did it reveals himself, will be removed, and the student will merely receive detention," she added, casting another look around however nobody spoke up. She said once more how disappointed she was, then told everyone to return to bed.Since the Marauders were quite close to the stairs they managed to be the first ones up. James dragged them all into the bathroom, shutting and locking the door behind them."Oh Merlin I thought I was a goner!" he moaned as he ripped off his robe, revealing his pajamas underneath, the legs rolled up."How did you manage that?" Peter asked."As soon as Sirius mentioned the shower I flew up the stairs," James replied, hurrying over to a stall where he pulled out his broom and cloak. "I dunked my head in a sink and got the robe on just as McGonagall knocked on the door."Peter swallowed, shaking his head. "Blimey! Quick thinking there, Jimmy.""I cannot, cannot, cannot believe you did it," Sirius said in awe."Nor I," Remus said, staring at his friend in disbelief. If he had made any bets about it, he would have absolutely bet on James being caught there. "That was incredible."James beamed, puffing his chest out. "Thank Sirius too, mates! Without him giving me the cover story I would have been caught. Go away!" he shouted as someone knocked at the door.Spinnet pounded at the door. "You did it. I know you did it!"James went over, unlocking the door so he could crack it open, peering out. "Did not," he snapped. "I was getting a shower.""At one in the morning?!" Spinnet banged the door open, furiously rushing in. Remus nudged James's robe to cover the cloak and broom. "I'm telling McGonagall in the morning you did it.""Yeah, yeah, sure." James flapped his hand at him. "I was getting a shower. I didn't do it.""Why? Why at one in the morning?!"James just shrugged. "I couldn't sleep. I thought a nice hot shower would feel good. Soothe my aching muscles." He gave a show of stretching his arms.Spinnet blinked a couple times. "What aching mu—!? What are you even talking about? I don't know how you managed..." He stepped closer to James, grabbing the front of his pajamas. "But you did it. I know you did.""Fine, believe what you want, s'not my problem." James pushed Spinnet away. "Just don't get in my face about it."Spinnet's hand darted to his pocket then remembered he didn't have his wand with him. "You two are absolute psychopaths. No, all three of you." His eyes went from James to Sirius to Remus. "None of you are normal!"Remus tried his best to ignore the sick, cold feeling creeping inside of him. The wolf stirred a little bit though he easily managed to push it back down.Sirius moved swiftly forward, grabbing Spinnet, shoving him back against the door. "First of all, don't ever call Remus crazy." He gave Spinnet another little shove. "Second of all, being normal? Is boring." He did another little shove. "And third of all, James obviously couldn't have done it. How could he have gotten from the stairs to the bathroom without any of us seeing him, hmmmm?"Spinnet's mouth opened and shut a couple times as he struggled to get free. "Don't ever touch me, Black!" He managed to get loose, throwing himself from Sirius. "You're all... just freaks!" He wrenched the door open, stomping back to the dorm."What's his problem?" Peter grumbled. "You should have popped him.""I should have," Sirius agreed."U...um... S-Sirius?" Remus stammered out. Sirius turned, fixating his silver eyes on him. "How come you told him not to call me crazy? And not yourself or James?""Because you won't and I know it bothers you being called that," he replied smoothly. "I remember last year when you said it bothers you, but denying it will just make you look it. So, I did it for you.""Oh." A little flower of warmth bloomed inside of his chest and suddenly he didn't know how his limbs worked. He stumbled a little as they headed back to their dorm, feeling exceedingly awkward—as well as a touch confused. He couldn't remember ever telling Sirius that. He thought back to any recent conversations, reaching back to the end of their first year, not recalling anything.In the morning as they were getting ready Remus decided to ask him. He and Sirius were in the bathroom alone, since James and Peter were sleeping in a little bit. "Um, Sirius?""Yeah?""Last night you said..." Then Remus wasn't sure whether or not to continue, it seemed so silly in the light of day. Sirius faced him, raising his eyebrows as he continued to brush his teeth, the pale blue potion dribbling out onto his chin. Guess I need to. "Last night you said you remembered that I once said it bothers me when people call me crazy and denying it would make me look crazier. I mean, it's true but... when did I tell you that?"Sirius spat the potion out into the sink. "January."Now Remus raised his eyebrows. "J... January...?""Yeah. Remember? In History class, we were passing notes." He looked upwards a little, clutching the toothbrush as he squinted, trying to remember. "You said... you didn't want to make yourself seem crazier, or something like that. You used a nerdy word instead. Then said that insisting you're not crazy just makes you look crazier. Also you said your middle name is Jirius."The memory came flooding back into Remus's head at the Jirius bit. He began laughing. "I completely forgot about that. You drew a chicken that said 'nerd'.""Yup!"No wonder he couldn't remember, if it had been in notes. Ah yes, that was after that really bad freakout, when I stayed overnight in the hospital. He shivered slightly. "Wow, how can you remember all that?""Iunno." Sirius spat out more potion then began rinsing his mouth out. "I still have the notes.""You do?"Sirius froze then his cheeks went slightly pink as he washed his hands. "Yeah, uh, I've, uh, kept most my notes from—from all of you.""Oh." Was he supposed to do that? Was that what people did? Keep notes from their friends? He sorta wished he still had them, especially the chicken. "Well. Um. Thank you. For last night.""No problem. Anyone calls you crazy, I'll break their nose."Remus shook his head, rinsing his own mouth out. The door flung open as James tumbled in, followed closely by Peter. James was still in an exuberant mood from getting away with what happened the night before though... as it turned out, he didn't get away with it at all. Mondays were one of their busy days—double Potions and Charms in the morning then History and Transfiguration in the afternoon—so by the time they went to Transfiguration class they were all pretty tired, ready for the classes to be over for the day. When the bell rang McGonagall dismissed class, except for James. She kept him behind.Sirius, Peter, and Remus hung out across the hall. While they were waiting Lily came over to talk to Remus."I think Macdonald is going to come to study group tonight," she said."I was wondering why she hadn't yet," Remus said. "Did she not come on Friday then?""No, she didn't." Lily began winding some of her hair around one finger. "I think she's just really nervous. This is all so new and frightening to her."I can relate, Remus thought, remembering how absolutely terrified he was to go to study group for the first time. "Just let her know she's very welcome," he said with a smile.Lily beamed back. "I will. I'll see you tonight!" She cast a scowl in Sirius's direction who pulled a face back at her. She flounced off, grumbling to herself about idiots."Still don't see how you can stand to be around her," said Sirius, rolling his eyes. "She's so annoying."Remus cocked an eyebrow at him. "I'm sure there's plenty that would say the same about you, you know."Sirius looked mildly offended. "Me? Pshaw! Who would ever say I'm irritating!""Um, probably about ninety percent of the school," Peter replied.Sirius glowered at him while Remus put his hand over his mouth to try to smother the laughter. Sirius was still pouting when James emerged from the classroom, rather pale. They got to their feet to walk with him, asking him what that was all about. James just hunched his shoulders, folding his arms, glaring straight ahead."She knows it was me," he finally said."What?" Sirius stopped in his tracks, grabbing James's arm. "What did she say?"James looked around, spotting a group of third years nearby. He jerked his head, hurrying off to a secret passageway where they could have a little bit of privacy to speak. "She said she knew it was me last night," he told them as soon as they were shut up in the darkness. Remus quickly pulled his wand out, lighting up the end. "She took twenty more points off. Said she gave me plenty of time to come forward last night and since I didn't, we've now got a total of seventy points taken away, plus I have detention." He threw himself back against the wall with an annoyed sort of grunt."How... how did she know?" Peter asked."I have no flipping idea!" James shouted, causing Peter and Remus to both cringe back. "She—she said she's not sure how I managed to not be seen but she knows I was using a broom.""Oh, damn it," Sirius said.James nodded miserably. "She said she knew because the only way the stairs wouldn't change is if someone wasn't on the stairs. The spell to set off the alarm is around the entrance, and the one for the stairs is on the actual steps. She said she's seen someone try a broom before, a million years ago when she was a student. Ugh! She kept demanding to know how I wasn't seen.""What did you say?" Peter asked.James angrily ran his fingers through his hair, messing it up. "Maintained my innocence. Told her it was unfair to blame me because I was in the shower. She said she knew I hadn't gotten a shower because when she came into the bathroom there wasn't any, um, humidity or whatever."Remus wanted to smack his own forehead. Of course, he thought, feeling stupid for not thinking of that sooner."She went into the bathroom?!" Peter demanded, horrified."Well, she knocked and asked if I was decent first, I—I said she could come in," he admitted. "Should have just come out myself but was so panicked.""But you told her you didn't do it," Sirius pressed.He nodded. "Of course I kept telling her it wasn't me but she doesn't believe me at all. She also gave me a lecture about how since I'm on the Gryffindor team I need to behave myself." James put his fingers up to do air quotes around the word behave."Th... that is true," Remus said, trying to ignore them all scowling at him. "If you get into too much trouble you—you might be kicked off the team."James began swelling up again with ego. "Nah. I'm too good for that. She knows it, too. I'll just keep wracking up detention. Plus my amazing Quidditch abilities will more than make up for the lost points. At least she didn't do this in front of everyone, so no one else knows it was me. Uggghh seventy points though...""I did say it was a bad idea," Remus said, unable to stop himself."You also said you thought it was the steps enchanted," James pointed out huffily.Remus put his hands on his hips. "Technically speaking I was right. The steps themselves were enchanted! Just... not... with both parts of the protective spells. Which is not something I anticipated. It is rather clever of them to do that, though. I'm assuming boys have tried the broom trick in the past. Or something similar.""Well, Brains, is there a way around it?" James asked.Remus spread his hands out. "Doubtfully.""So we can't sneak into the girls' dorms," sighed Sirius.Remus bit his bottom lip, trying not to smile since he knew there was a way. He had no plans to tell them since it would merely cause more trouble however they could tell by his expression he was hiding something. All three of them wheedled it out."All right, all right!" He began tugging at the hem of his vest, a little amazed none of them had seen the answer before. "There is possibly a way to get into their dorms via broom.""Um. No. Last night proved that?" James scoffed.Remus shrugged. "Perhaps the windows aren't enchanted?"James, Sirius, and Peter were all silent as they absorbed this theory. James and Sirius's faces slowly lit up with huge grins."You mean... fly up? Outside?" Pete asked. Remus nodded.James grabbed Remus's shoulders. "You, my little friend with a big brain, are an absolute genius!""Please note that I said perhaps!" Remus said as they took off running. "Besides, it's time for supper—guys? Come on, guys? You really want to get in trouble for doing the same thing in less than twenty-four hou—oh, bloody hell. Wait for me!"He let out a sigh and went after his friends, easily catching up to them; James had started to dash up a flight of stairs before coming to a stop. Sirius ran into him, Peter into him, and Remus managed not to run into him though only because he had tripped on the stairs coming up. He staggered up the steps, rubbing his elbow while James whirled around."Can't do it," he said."How come?" Sirius asked. "It should work—"James shook his head. "No, I mean, can't do it now. I've got to meet up with the Quidditch team soon. We have a meeting in about fifteen minutes. About practices." Sirius's face fell a little. "You could try it without me," James suggested hesitantly. "Borrow my broom.""Nah. No fun without you." Sirius punched James's arm. "We'll try another day."James's eyes lit up then he quickly glanced around to make sure nobody was around to listen in. "You could borrow my cloak and steal the mandrake!" he whispered.Remus's stomach lurched. He wasn't sure which was worse, trying to sneak into the girls' dorm or stealing a mandrake. Sirius and Peter were both enthusiastic about stealing the mandrake, so Remus let out a resolved sigh, reluctantly agreeing to the plan as well, a little amazed at James's ability to want to just jump right into trouble again two seconds after getting into major trouble.

Remus grumbled and grouched as he, Sirius, and Peter went up to their dorm room to fetch James's cloak. He kept repeating that he didn't think it was a good idea. "There are loads of other things we could do to the Slytherin dorm!" he hissed out as they reached the corridor leading to the Fat Lady. "Safer pranks.""You said so yourself it'll just knock'em out," Peter said. "Sprout told you that you were right."Remus sighed, giving up. They got James's cloak from his dresser then headed back down through the castle, the cloak folded into one of Sirius's robes pockets. They went outside while everyone else was at supper except for the Gryffindor team who was out at the pitch. Sirius, Peter, and Remus headed around towards the greenhouses, going a little slower as they approached but none of the doors were open. Remus couldn't hear any voices nearby."If we are doing this," grumbled Remus, "then one of us should go in while the other two wait over there. If anyone decides to come to the greenhouses they most likely will be approaching from that direction. The two can essentially be guards." He didn't add that he'd prefer to be a guard. He had gotten freaked out enough when he went in the other day, when Hagrid nearly caught them."I'll go in," Sirius said; Peter let out an audible sigh.Sirius pressed his hand against his pocket, eyes darting around before he went off towards some bushes. Remus and Peter backed away towards the spot Remus had pointed out, near the corner of the castle. Remus leaned against the wall while Peter pulled out a small rubber ball, bouncing it off the stone, dropping it more often than catching it. Remus tried his best not to look towards the greenhouse, making vague conversation with Peter."What do we say if anyone does come by?" Peter asked.Remus saw out of the corner of his eye the door to Greenhouse Three opening and shutting. "We're waiting for James," he replied, folding his arms. "I meant to ask you, by the way; are you joining photography club?" The clubs had started putting up their notices the day before, advertising for new membership; Peter had been standing in front of the one for photography for ages.His hand jerked, the ball hitting the stone pretty hard. It flew off across the grounds. "Oops."Remus got his wand out. "Locomotor ball." He pulled it back, having to redo the spell once since the ball was rather small and kept getting caught on things. "I really need to work on learning the summoning spell...""I—I dunno," Peter mumbled, going over to get the ball when it came close enough. "Probably not.""You should. You're talented.""I dunno," he repeated, twisting the ball around in his hands. "Would you join with me?"Remus snorted. "I am quite crap at taking photos. Maybe Sirius will, he's artistic. Hey, set the ball down again, I want to try something." Peter obeyed and Remus straightened up, licking his lips as he got into a stance. "Accio ball!" He felt the magic surge through him, saw the spell hit the ball however nothing happened."Aw, try again?" Pete suggested. Remus tried a couple more times and after another minute or so he managed to get the ball to twitch. "When do we learn that spell?" he asked as he picked the ball up."Next year," Remus replied, wiping the sweat from his forehead then automatically turned as he heard faint footsteps in the grass. "Did you get it?""How did you know I was there?" whispered Sirius's disembodied voice.Remus did his best to keep his face calm. He was getting too slack around his friends! "I—I saw your footsteps in the grass.""You were facing the other way," Sirius accused. "But yeah, I got it."They went inside, to a secret passage where Sirius took the cloak off. He opened his bag to show the potted mandrake. Peter gave a squeal, clapping his hands. "Slytherins gonna get it!" he giggled.Sirius grinned, giving Pete a high five. "It's gonna be great.""We are just doing it to Mulciber, Avery, and Bulstrode's dorm, correct?" Remus asked, shifting his weight around.Now Sirius rolled his eyes. "Yeah, we won't be pranking your stupid friend.""Silverlocke is not stupid—""Anyway!" Sirius closed his bag then tucked James's cloak into his pocket. "Mission accomplished. I'd say this is grounds for a major award. Let's get some food from the kitchen, I don't want to sit in the Great Hall right now."They ended up back in their dorm, food spread out on Sirius's bed. They chattered away about nothing in particular until Remus nudged at Peter. Peter kept giving him strange looks, not getting it, so Remus sucked in some air. "Hey, Sirius? Would you join Photography club with Pete?"Sirius paused, food halfway to his mouth. "Photography?""It's n-nothing!" Peter said quickly. "Remus is just being dumb.""Naw, what is it?" Sirius set his half-eaten sandwich down.Peter glared at Remus who pretended like he didn't notice. "I just—well, Photography club is open for, um, for second years and up. Remus... thought I might like it but...""Your pictures are bloody brilliant!" Sirius said earnestly. "You should join."Pete began blushing. "I—I don't know...""He doesn't want to do it alone," Remus put in. Peter adjusted his position so he could kick at Remus, his socked foot landing a soft blow against Remus's leg who scooted away, smiling."I'm not that into cameras—well, I am but more on the opposite side," Sirius laughed as he struck a pose. "But sure. I'll go with you, at least to one." He stuffed the entire half sandwich into his mouth. "Ain owi i ay oh."Peter squinted. "Um. What?"Sirius chewed and swallowed. "Can't promise I'll stay, though. When's it start?"Remus doubted Peter knew however he surprised them by scurrying over to his bed, fetching a copy of the advertisement out from a desk drawer. "Wednesday evening," he said, returning to show off the bit of parchment. "From six-thirty to seven-fifteen."Sirius made a face as he read the paper then dropped it back into Peter's lap. "Yeah, I'll go with you."Peter beamed while Remus gave him an I-told-you-so look. Pete just kicked him again. "Stop looking so smug.""He's a know-it-all, he can't help it," teased Sirius. "Are you going to join any clubs, Brains?"Remus stuck his tongue out. "No. I don't have time. Besides, study group might as well be a club. Speaking of which..." He checked the clock over the door then slithered off of Sirius's bed to gather books up. "I better get going. Make sure you put the mandrake in a very safe place. We should probably do this tomorrow, since we can't keep the poor plant locked away from the sun for much longer."He got his shoes back on then hurried through the castle to the library, a little nervous at the thought of meeting someone new. Even a first year. She was already there by the time he got to their usual table, sitting on the opposite side of Lily—between Lily and Twycross. Remus felt a little relieved as he took his usual seat between Lily and Silverlocke."Everyone, this is Mary Macdonald," Lily said when Buckling and Craft showed up about ten seconds later. Lily then introduced everyone at the table, finishing with 'my good friend Remus Lupin' which made Remus feel pleased.Macdonald was a Chinese girl with long hair and enormous eyes. Remus immediately could tell she was a timid sort, shrinking back, staying as close to Lily as possible. "H—hi," she whispered."Welcome to our study group," Pierce said with a smile. She leaned across the table to offer her hand which Macdonald nervously shook."Is it really okay for me to be here?" Macdonald asked, her Scottish accent quite thick, glancing around at everyone. "I mean, since I'm just a first year?""Of course it is," Lily said firmly, shooting a look towards first Twycross then Craft, both of whom remained silent."So how are we doing this?" Craft finally asked. "Since she's studying stuff we aren't.""I was thinking we could go over our homework like we always do," Lily said, sticking her chin out. "Mary included. Then, er, go from there."It was a little awkward at first since Craft launched into rather complicated explanations of the assignments they were doing, purposely making it sound more confusing than it really was. Macdonald looked even more terrified while Lily just shook her head. When they got to Macdonald's homework she nervously asked questions, blushing once when Twycross snorted at a rather simple question. Remus grew very annoyed. He didn't really like Twycross or Craft and their attitude towards Macdonald really cheesed him off. Remus did his best to be clearly on her side but with as much as he stammered it was difficult.Afterwards as they headed back to their common room Lily apologized to Macdonald. "It's all right," she replied softly. "I think it's better if I don't come after all. It is a little silly when you're all... more advanced." She looked ahead at Twycross's swishing ponytail. "Plus I think a couple of your friends aren't happy with me.""They're not really friends, not those two," Lily confessed. "We all just sorta grouped together last year. I don't mind the rest of the group. Sometimes I wish we could just kick Craft and Twycross out." Lily looked at Remus who smiled back, privately agreeing. "Hey, if you don't want to come back that's fine. I can help you.""Really?" Macdonald perked up."Of course," Lily promised."I c-c-can help t—too," Remus said. "We've g-got plenty of t-time after c-c-curfew anyway.""I don't like curfew, it's so early," sighed Macdonald, kicking at the floor."I know what you mean," agreed Lily. "In the winter it's not as annoying since it gets dark so early but this time of the year it'd be nice to be able to stay outside.""Isn't yours later than mine?""Yeah, by an hour. Still seems too early...""In our f-fourth it will b-be nine pm," Remus said. "Then in—in our sixth it's ten-thirty."They got to the common room, climbing through the hole which Remus fell through. Lily helped him up while Macdonald made a comment about the hole being so difficult to get through, wondering about anyone who might be physically disabled. "Are there even any students who use wheelchairs?" she asked. "Can—can they come to Hogwarts? My mum, she—she uses a wheelchair and she'd never be able to come here.""Not wheelchairs, but something similar," Lily said, searching the common room then nodding to a corner where some older students were hanging out including a boy who couldn't walk. The chair he was in looked mostly like a regular armed chair but it had several strange looking things folded up around the bottom. "Their chairs have something like spider legs instead of wheels, so they can climb up and down the stairs. I think I've also read about floating chairs, but I think for getting around Hogwarts it's easier to have the spider legs."Macdonald stared at the contraption in amazement then quickly averted her gaze. "That sounds kinda creepy but also cool. So... magic can't fix everything?"Remus felt slightly embarrassed as Lily very swiftly glanced his way then just as swiftly back at Macdonald. "No, not everything."Macdonald noticed the glance too but seemed too polite to ask, and Lily realized what she had inadvertently done and went brilliantly red. Remus didn't know what to do. It seemed awkward to just offer up that he was sick. He knew he looked sick. He just didn't want to explain Lily's glance, to say the words he was sick to a perfect stranger. He almost did... felt like he should, like he had to. Then bit back the words and said instead, "But, um, y—yeah, as Lily s-said we'll h-help you with your assignments." Besides, she'd figure it out soon enough when he disappeared for a few days, if she was going to be present in his life at least occasionally in the evenings.Just then to cut into the uncomfortable silence there was a very loud explosion. The three of them jumped, turning to see some fireworks zinging around the room. Students yelped, ducking, a few diving to the floor."Three guesses to where those came from," Lily snapped.Remus just smiled, tugging his bag higher on his shoulder. "I'll s-see you l-later." He hurried to the corner where a prefect was chewing out the other Marauders./\/\/\/\/\He was wandering in the forest while Lily's voice echoed around him, Magic can't fix everything! He heard someone crying. Maybe Lily. He prowled among the trees, panting for blood. The crying became louder. He came into a clearing where Sirius and Peter were unconscious from the crying mandrake. It didn't hurt Remus's ears since he was a wolf. He went over, bending down to bite into the mandrake but then when his teeth crashed through the plant, blood—human blood—spurted out and he had bitten into Peter's arm instead of the mandrake. Magic can't fix that either! Lily's voice floated out of no where. What are you doing?! demanded another voice. Remus spun around to see James holding his broom which was entirely silver. Remus was human now, Peter's blood dripping out of his mouth. I c-c-c-can explain! Remus cried out, holding out bloody hands in a pleading manner. James lifted his broom which had gone very pointy at the end. Sorry, little buddy, he said then jammed the silver spear through Remus's chest.Remus woke up with a loud "NO!" then a choking sort of sob. "D-didn't... mean to..." He grabbed for his chest, pressing his fingers against his pajama top to feel for the hole. Then he hunched forward, covering his face with his hands as the clinging remnants of the dream faded, leaving him back fully in reality.Tap-tap-tap.Remus remained silent. His 'no' had been louder than he thought."Remus?" Sirius whispered. The curtains twitched back and Remus looked up at his friend. "You all right?""F-fine," Remus lied as Sirius hopped up onto the bed, shutting the curtains so they wouldn't wake anyone else up. "I'm okay. R-really." This again, for the millionth time."What didn't you mean to?" Sirius asked gently.Remus frowned. "I don't r-remember. I—I don't know wh-what I was dreaming about." He could still taste the blood in his mouth. Could see Peter's destroyed arm. He was glad it had been Peter's arm he had bit; if it had been Sirius's then he wasn't sure he'd be able to handle talking to him right now."You're shaking."Remus looked at his hands then drew his legs up, wrapping his arms around his knees. "S'fine.""It isn't cause of the mandrake, is it?" Sirius asked causing Remus to jerk his head up, a touch afraid that Sirius somehow knew part of his nightmare. "You seemed pretty anxious about it earlier.""Oh. Oh, no, th—that's not it." He didn't want to admit the mandrake had affected his dream. "Erm, I—I'm feeling all right. I am. You—you d-don't need to stay up with me.""Okay..." But Sirius didn't budge. "Can we... talk... about—about something?" Remus just waited, suspecting that Sirius wanted to talk about his sickness and sure enough after a few seconds Sirius went, "About what you have?""I d-d-don't want to.""Okay," he said again. "I just... I mean... you said before it... it isn't fatal... right? I just want to... be double sure that's, uh, that's what's been said."Remus felt a little bit bad for being so annoyed with his friend over his pushiness if that's what he was so concerned about. Unfortunately he couldn't remember what he said about this. He was pretty sure he said it wasn't... yet. Right? Ugh, he really needed to write down all the lies he said so he could keep them straight. "I-I'm not going to die anytime soon, if th—that's what you're worried about," he finally said.Sirius went white. "It is fatal," he said flatly. "Merlin's beard.""No—I meant—" Remus tried not to swear, tried not to panic. "I'm fine, right now. I promise.""Right now?""It could get worse," he babbled, clutching his hands together to prevent them from shaking even more than before. What had he said exactly?! He thought he said it wasn't though it could be, right? He wracked his brain for any memory but they just slipped away. He wished he could look into his own head. Or into Sirius's. What he wouldn't give to be able to do Legilimancy right now, even if it was completely morally wrong to do so. "Look, I'm fine. Okay?" Sirius was giving him a strange look that didn't seem to be concern or worry which sent Remus into even more of a panic. "I don't want to talk about it!" he snapped, his voice strained."Okay," Sirius said once more. "I didn't mean to upset you. I shouldn't have pushed.""You know I d-d-don't like—""Yeah, I know, I shouldn't have," Sirius said, rubbing the back of his neck. "I guess I get so worried I don't think about what I'm saying.""How is that different from any other time?" Remus teased.Sirius grinned, nudging Remus with his foot. "Too true. You know... it's interesting.""What is?""Just... how much you've changed." Sirius propped himself up on his hands, leaning back, the grin broadening. "This time last year you mostly just babbled incoherent nonsense and ran away from me crying."Remus glared then kicked Sirius's leg, although he had teased Sirius so turnabout and all that. "Well, I still want to run away from you crying so..."Sirius laughed. "You're also a lot sassier than I ever thought you'd be."Remus crinkled his nose a little, his father's lecture coming back to him, though he remembered Sirius calling him that before. "I'm not sassy."Sirius's eyebrows arched high. "Merlin, Remus, you're sassy.""I am not.""Okay, okay," Sirius said, obviously not believing him. "Whatever it is you are, I never expected it of you. But it's not a bad thing. Honest."Remus scowled now, shifting into a cross-legged position so he could tug at a loose thread sticking out of his pajamas. "Why are we even having this conversation at... what time is it?""Um, around three?""Three in the morning?""I dunno."Remus let out an annoyed sound. "You're the one who brought all this up.""All right, well, I thought if we talked about other stuff it might be easier for you to go to sleep," Sirius replied rather icily. Remus just looked at him. "When... when, um, I have nightmares... if I think about them before I try to go back to sleep I tend to have more nightmares. I just thought if we chatted about other stuff, you—you might be able to sleep easier.""Oh..." He tugged the loose thread free, unraveling a new hole in his pajama pants. "I usually have nightmares regardless. However, they tend to not wake me up so it isn't much of a big deal."Sirius gave him an exasperated look. "Are they awful? Your 'nightmares regardless'?""Hmm? Oh, erm, I guess...""So it is a big deal."Remus shrugged. "I don't wake up screaming, or crying, or—or—""Or saying you didn't mean to?"His face flushed slightly. "So it isn't a big deal," he just continued, ignoring him."Right." Sirius stretched out his legs, wriggling his socked toes. "I guess I should go, then. Let you get back to sleep.""Probably," Remus agreed, noticing the flicker in Sirius's expression. "I appreciate the help, though. I do." He rubbed at his face, sighing. "I just feel embarrassed, for waking you up. You really don't need to bother.""I know I don't need to," Sirius said as he scooted closer to the edge of the bed, "but I like to. If you want me to stop then I will."Remus bit his bottom lip then shook his head. It embarrassed him, yes, however there was something rather nice about someone caring about him like that. Even if it was annoying sometimes. "I don't mind.""Okay. See you in the morning."Sirius disappeared through the curtains and Remus slid under his covers, hand searching under his pillows until he found Gwyllgi. He hugged the black dog to his chest, curling his body up as much as he could around the stuffed animal, then drifted back into sleep.

Please report to the Hospital Wing after Defense Against the Dark Arts today.Remus looked at his note in confusion, rereading it multiple times to try and glean anymore information from it. It wasn't his detention, it said nothing about detention... so what did it mean? It gave him something else to think besides the mandrake prank which they were doing after Herbology.Because of this, none of them could pay much attention to Professor Sprout. Not even Remus, hard as he tried to take notes and do what she asked. Sirius, James and Peter were just flat out goofing off to expend some of their pent up excitement while Remus just kept his inside, feeling it build up. He also felt incredibly nervous. If they were caught...We won't be, he told himself as he scribbled down some information Sprout gave. We managed to get away with the Bat-Bogey prank, plus Dedenne's underwear... dozens of other small things... we'll get away with it...After class the four of them went to one of the bathrooms on the ground floor. Sirius banged open every stall to make sure they were alone while Remus locked the door. James pulled out the cloak, carefully shaking it out."Okay," he said, a slight tremble in his voice betraying his own nerves. This was a Big One. Not just sneaking around after hours but breaking into another common room! "Here's the plan." He glanced at Remus who suddenly felt even worse. Something was going on they didn't share with him. "Sirius, Remus, and I will be sneaking in—""What?!" Remus yelped. "Wa—wait a moment, since when was I sneaking in?!""We need a lookout," Sirius said, studiously avoiding Remus's gaze. "We voted last night for it to be you."Remus's jaw dropped then anger boiled up. "When was this vote? Why wasn't I part of it?""You were at study group thingie," James answered. "Besides, even if you were there it'd be three against one.""No!" Remus snapped."I'm crap at being lookout!" Peter said anxiously. "You're the best."Remus folded his arms, glowering at his friends. "I never agreed to this." They all just gave him pathetic, pleading looks. He knew he'd give in, but wanted to hold out a little bit longer. "You never even asked.""Will you be lookout?" James asked then dropped to his knees, clasping his hands together. "Please?"Remus fought off the urge to smile. "Wellll..."Now Sirius got on his knees as well, hands together. "Plleeeeaaaseeee?" both boys chorused.Remus gave in to the giggles. "Fine, fine.""Yay!" James and Sirius both bounced to their feet."Now," James said, continuing on as though none of that happened, "Sirius, Remus, and I will be sneaking in. Peter, you have potentionally the most dangerous job...""Potentially?" Remus asked quietly but nobody heard him."I know," sighed Peter, shivering. "I'll be standing down the hall," he explained to a curious Remus, "and if Mulciber, Avery, or Bulstrode come by I need to... distract them.""As in you're going to end up in the hospital wing," Remus said flatly, wishing his friends had talked over this when he was around.Peter cringed back. "P—probably...""They have class, though," Sirius said. "Anyway, so the plan is..."/\/\/\/\/\James, Sirius, and Remus crowded under the invisibility cloak. They left Peter near the entrance to the dungeons, sitting down with a comic book, wishing him luck before creeping down. Remus huddled close to Sirius who, as the tallest, was in the middle holding the cloak up. They got to a blank section of wall then James said, "Phineas Black."Sirius gagged slightly as a door slid open. The three hurried in, just slipping past a Slytherin prefect who was giving the door a weird look, probably since it had opened without anyone coming in.James and Sirius faltered slightly when they got into the common room properly, Remus nearly walking out from under the cloak. James grabbed hold of his arm, jerking him back. Remus started to ask why did you stop?! then quickly held his tongue. They seemed pretty interested in seeing what the Slytherin common room looked like. Remus looked around too.It was a very long room, narrower than it was long so it formed a rectangle. The walls were rough stone with the occasional window of reinforced glass. At least, Remus assumed it was reinforced glass due to the fact the windows all looked out into the lake. They could see some of the long weeds growing, and fish swimming around. Remus wondered how often they could see the giant squid.Besides the view of the water the common room was adorned with green lamps hanging off chains, several portraits and tapestries of famous Slytherins including one Remus noticed was labeled Phineas Nigellus Black which was where they got their password; he wondered how he was related to Sirius. Then Remus realized he recognized the portrait being the same man whose portrait hung in Dumbledore's office. He was one of the old headmasters!There were several students hanging around, some sitting in low-backed chairs chatting to each other, there were several playing games such as chess or cards. One student was standing near one of the windows watching the fish. The back of his head seemed so familiar and Remus jerked when he realized it was the same as Sirius's glorious waves. It was Regulus.Sirius noticed him too, moving to get closer. Since he was holding up the cloak James and Remus were forced to follow. They got into position to see his face. He was just staring out at the lake with sad eyes, lips down in a frown, forehead slightly wrinkled. His arms were stiff at his sides. He just looked so sad it hurt Remus's heart."Black!"Sirius jerked and the three of them stumbled back to avoid another first year jogging over."We're going to play Sphinxes, want to join? We need a fourth."Remus felt a stab of memory from the previous year when the other Marauders would ask him to be their fourth in sphinxes. Regulus faced the boy with a rather startled look. His hand fluttered to his chest, tugging at his tie."Me?""What other Black is there? I don't see your cousin anywhere," laughed the boy. "Come on."Regulus hesitated then went after the boy, to a table with two other first years. Sirius just stood there watching his brother until James elbowed him. Sirius shook himself then they went over to the two staircases. They weren't labeled. Of course they weren't. They weren't in the Gryffindor common room. They just stood there staring at the two entrances, no idea which to go up, which would set off the alarm."Didn't think this part through," James whispered."Let's wait a moment and see if anyone uses them," suggested Remus so they backed away to a corner, waiting. After about three minutes a girl descended from one side, so the three Marauders headed up the other. They reached two doors labeled Second Year. James chose one, knocking at the door. They waited a moment then James opened it up, the three of them leaning in to take a peek. Four beds. Wrong dorm. They knocked at the other one then peered in. Three beds.James and Sirius ducked out from under the cloak, shutting the door behind them while Remus waited nervously in the hall under the cloak. If any of the second years came up he'd knock at the door in a certain pattern to warn his friends. He could hear rustling in the dorm, and faint giggles. He wrapped his arms around himself, letting the cloak cover him without holding it up. He paced a little then sucked in some air as he heard footsteps. They sounded too heavy to be a second year, so Remus waited another moment, pressing back against the door, blood pounding in his ears as he saw someone approaching, then felt relieved as he saw it was a much older student, probably a sixth year. Remus pressed harder into the little recess of the doorway, holding his breath, holding the door shut behind him. The Slytherin walked right past him without noticing at all, disappearing around a corner. Remus soon heard a door open and shut.He let out his breath and backed away. Come on, he thought, shifting his weight from foot to foot, chewing probably too violently at his bottom lip. Finally after what felt like an eternity the door cracked open. Remus held up the cloak so the others could duck underneath, shutting the door behind them."It's all set," James snickered. "Next person to open that door will send the pot shattering to the ground, and the mandrake will start crying knocking out whoever it is."They started to head down the stairs then had to back up against a door as another student passed them. Then they hurried down the stairs, a little breathless, trying not to laugh. Sirius hesitated when they passed Regulus but kept going. They had to dodge a couple Slytherins then reached the entrance. James opened the door and they slipped out as quickly as they could, hurrying back to Peter."C'mon!" Sirius whispered, kicking at Peter's foot. Pete yelped, dropping the comic then quickly scooped it up. "Bathroom."Back in the bathroom, Peter checked out the stalls to make sure they were in the clear before they ripped the cloak off."We DID it!" James shrieked, jumping, punching the air. "Oh man, oh man!""Merlin, I was so scared!" Peter said, grabbing James's hands. "I kept waiting for the shouts that you were caught!""We very nearly were," said Sirius. Remus raised his eyebrows, wondering when exactly that happened. "An older student almost walked into us," he said gravely. Peter gasped out while Remus snorted, covering his mouth. Sirius glared at him which just made Remus giggle more. "Well. Nearly almost walked into us."They spent what little remained of the morning in the Great Hall playing Sphinxes thanks to those first year Slytherins, and once noon hit they were on the edge of their seats, wondering if any of the jerks had gone into their dorm... but then Mulciber, Avery, and Bulstrode all came in so obviously they hadn't."We'll probably hear about it at supper," James said as they went to Defense.In Defense there was a lot of lecturing about some creatures then a little bit about dueling at the end. They were paired with training dummies as they focused on offensive spells. After class Remus hung about behind to hand in the rest of his essays then tried to make his escape however Prewett cleared his throat, asking him to wait a moment. Remus froze then turned, waiting for whatever his teacher had to say."I've skimmed your other essays, I have not looked through them thoroughly yet... however I did see that they're good." Prewett stood up, tapping his finger against one of the scrolls on his desk. "Very good. Very impressive. I just wish to know why you've done them all already when I clearly said you have until the end of the month?"He hugged his bag to his chest tightly. "Um. W—well, I—I knew I c-could. It's fine. I mean, I've done all my other ho—homework. I made sure to do those first, I promise."Prewett cocked his head to one side. "That isn't an answer to my question of why."Remus swallowed, ducking his head so his hair fell across his eyes. "I... wanted to?""Is that a definite answer, or one you think I want to hear?""I wanted to," he repeated, this time firmly. He still looked at the ground though. "I w—wanted to prove to myself that—that I could." He dug his nails into the satchel, not sure why Prewett wanted to know all this. He did the work as asked. What was the problem? "I... enjoy doing this sort of—of thing.""I see." Prewett tugged the scrolls closer though didn't open them. "I gave you the month so you wouldn't feel pressured. I don't wish you to overly exert yourself.""N-no, sir."Prewett eyed him carefully then smiled. "Very well. I'll let you know when I have more assignments for you."Remus left, a little disappointed he wasn't given more yet. The other Marauders were waiting for him which made him feel a little bad to say he had something he needed to do. That piqued their curiosity, wanting to know what. He mumbled incoherently about 'things' then quickly left, dodging down corridors to make sure they weren't following him. At the hospital wing he found Madame Pomfrey in deep conversation with Professor McGonagall. Remus hesitated, feeling fear creeping up through his body. He wondered wildly if she somehow knew about the mandrake thing."Ah, Mr. Lupin." Pomfrey gave him a gentle smile upon seeing him.Professor McGonagall turned around, also smiling albeit not as widely. "Thank you for coming, Mr. Lupin. There are a few things we need to discuss if you will come with me."Huh? Remus followed her out of the hospital wing. "Um, where—where are we g-going?""To your house in Hogsmeade," she replied in a calm voice. "I would have met you at the main doors however Poppy needed to know when we were leaving."Remus's heart began going faster. Why? he wanted to ask. What's going on? He shuffled after her, glancing wildly around in worry that the other Marauders might see him. They got out of the school without seeming to raise any suspicions, heading across the grounds towards the Whomping Willow. "D... don't... you have class?" he inquired, very curious."One of the substitutes is teaching for me at the moment," she explained."Sub...stitutes?""Yes, we employ a handful of other teachers who can step in if need be," she said. "You may have seen them at the High Table on occasion."Remus did recall a small variety of teachers he didn't recognize, and nodded. "I thought there were too many to cover the electives.""They typically do not stay at Hogwarts. You will probably be meeting them sooner or later. We try to prioritize first, fifth, and seventh year classes which is why you have not met any of the substitutes yet. Here we are. Go ahead."It took him a second to realize she meant to open the secret passageway. He scooped up a couple rocks, chucking them as hard as he could at the trunk. It took several tries before he hit the mark causing the tree to freeze up. They quickly ducked into the passage and began making their way towards Hogsmeade."Nothing bad has happened, has it?" he asked."We'll talk at the house. But no, nothing bad," she promised. "How are classes going?""Um—good. I've, um, finished the essay you set yesterday."She glanced over her shoulder, giving him a rather long look. "That was quick. Was it too easy?"He couldn't help but smile. "N... not exactly easy, I know none of... I mean, James, Sirius, and Peter haven't done it yet. I like Transfiguration.""I'm glad to hear it."They made light conversation until they finally reached the end of the tunnel. McGonagall pushed open the trapdoor, allowing Remus to climb up first before following him into the house. Remus hadn't seen the house since the end of May. It had grown quite dusty, needing a good cleaning. There was dried blood all over the place (which made him cringe) as well as destroyed fabric and furniture. McGonagall swept past him into the first floor bathroom where something new had been put up over the summer.A chalkboard?"After much discussion..." McGonagall adjusted her rectangular glasses, frowning a little as she spoke, "...the decision has been made to allow a trial period of you remaining in this house for the entire duration of the full moon."Remus perked up immediately. "What? R-really?""Yes," she said in a tone that he suspected meant she had been against it. "This board is connected to one that is in Madame Pomfrey's office. Every morning within an hour of sunrise you are to leave a message for her." She picked up a piece of chalk and wrote we're here, are you receiving this message? "If you are well enough, you will tell her. If you need help, you must tell her. If she does not receive a message from you within the hour she will come and get you."Writing began appearing under McGonagall's handwriting. everything is good on this end. McGonagall wrote a quick note saying it worked on this end too."You will also leave a message sometime before sunset," McGonagall said as they left the bathroom. She went over to sit down on one of the broken up couches while Remus just stood there, a little stunned.. "Just to let us know how the day went. If you do not, Madame Pomfrey will come in the morning regardless of what you write after—... after waking up." After turning human again, he thought, looking towards the bathroom. "Understand?" she pressed.He nodded. "Yes ma'am. Within an hour of sunrise I'm to leave a message for her. If I'm okay, I say that, if I need help, I say that. Then at the end of the day before I'm transformed again I need to let her know again.""Good. This is..." McGonagall trailed off, smoothing her robes out. "This isn't something I agree with. You're only twelve. I don't believe you should be left alone. Professor Dumbledore believes otherwise." She gave a slight sniffle then glanced over at one of the tables whose legs had been chewed on. "It depends on how this upcoming moon goes for you. If it doesn't go well, we will once more be bringing you back to the castle every morning. Also... if it does work out perfectly fine then someone might be coming to check up on you once in a while.""I understand." He wanted to argue he was perfectly mature enough to be left alone! What could possibly happen? "I—I am alone here in human form when I don't transform some nights," he pointed out then suddenly was very glad none of them knew he had viciously burned the flesh off his own arm one of those nights."Yes," McGonagall reluctantly agreed."Um... m—may I ask why we came here now?" he asked and she gave him a vaguely confused look. "Instead of just coming a little early on the first night of the moon?""Ah, yes. That was my decision. I could have merely told you about the chalkboard however I wanted you to see it, in action so to speak. Also I wished to give you time to think." She stood up again, flourishing one arm. "Do you really want to stay here every day during the full moon phase?"Remus gave the room a cursory glance. The broken furniture, the dried blood, the smell of wolf urine which hopefully McGonagall couldn't really smell since it had been so long. "I think it will be easier than coming and going," he said.McGonagall gave a sigh. "As I thought you might say. In any case, you need to report to Madame Pomfrey tonight. She says you have to learn how to better take care of your... ah, wounds, as you will be needing to bandage yourself now.""I have Occlumency tonight," he mumbled."It ends at seven?" she asked to which he nodded. "You can go to her after, and if you wind up staying past curfew she can write you a note." She approached Remus, putting her hand on his shoulder. "Please don't just dismiss this, Mr. Lupin. I don't think it's a safe idea for you to remain here daily.""I'll think about it," he lied. McGonagall could tell it was a lie too, he knew.She gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze then the two of them returned to Hogwarts./\/\/\/\/\It was almost supper by the time Remus returned to the school and he didn't really feel like finding the Marauders for a little bit then disappearing again, so he snuck into the kitchens to get some food which he took up to the empty classroom where he and Fawley met for Occlumency. When she showed up he told her the exciting news although she just frowned and informed him that she had been asked as well, and had agreed with McGonagall that he was too young."I'm... mature enough," he grumbled."And what prank are you lot planning now?" she asked, noticing the slight hesitation."N—none!" he protested then began blushing. "Well... I mean, we did one... earlier today..."Fawley chuckled, shaking her head. "How bad is it?""Er, well..." He wrung his hands nervously. "It involves a mandrake. And the Slytherin dorm.""Mandrake!?" she demanded."A v—very y-y-young one I p—promise!" he spluttered. "Very young! Baby.""Remus Lupin I am shocked that you'd ever even... consider such a dangerous idea!" Her face had gone very pale, the muscles in her cheeks twitching. "The cry of the mandrake—""Is f-fatal, yes, b—but not when they're so young," he mumbled, tugging hard at his vest, stomach hurting so bad he thought he might vomit. "It wasn't my idea. I tried to talk them out of it, but trying to talk James and Sirius out of anything is—""An impossible chore," she said. "I know. How did you get into the dorm, may I ask? Without being noticed?"She hadn't seen James's invisibility cloak the previous week. "Um, well, we—we managed...""Remus, dear, I'm going to see it, whatever it is."He let out a miserable sigh. He hated giving away their secrets, wished he didn't need to... wished he already knew Occlumency. If he was better, he could! But he wasn't good enough, he was crap. "James has an invisibility cloak. P—please don't tell anyone. Please."Miss Fawley put her face in her hands. "An invisibility cloak? Dear Merlin, you lot are going to wreak absolute havoc!""Please?" he whispered."I won't." Her face was still in her hands but Remus thought he detected the hint of a smile. "What happens between us is private, unless I find something that truly needs reporting like... when your father..." Remus looked away, fiddling more with the hem of his vest. Fawley coughed. "Well, in any case, unless you four are planning on irreparable harm on another student, I won't give away your pranks. Knocking them out for a short while is not exceedingly harmful so I shall let this one slide, though I do disapprove.""Do you think because I help pull pranks I'm not mature enough to remain on my own for a few days?" Remus asked, returning to what began the whole conversation."It's got nothing to do with your mischievous nature, my dear, and everything to do with your youth. You are remarkably mature in some ways for a boy of twelve, however it doesn't change the fact you are twelve. But, it's out of my hands. What is in my hands is your head. Let's practice."She saw them sneaking into the Slytherin dorm, as well as a multitude of other small memories flitting through. They separated while Remus tried his best to empty himself out. I managed a bit a few months ago, I can do it again. He sucked in some air then bent forward for Fawley to brush her fingers against his temples. He felt an intense stab of pain and fell back with a yelp."Are you all right?" she asked."It hurts," he mumbled, rubbing his forehead."You fought against me.""I—I did?""A little," she assured him, lips twisting into a big smile. "Like you had before. I wasn't expecting that.""Let's try again!""No, no, you should rest a few minutes."He sulked until she was willing to try again but unfortunately he couldn't replicate what he had just done though his head began hurting even more. They tried on and off until Fawley decided enough was enough, cutting the lesson a little bit short. They said their goodbyes and Remus almost just went back to the common room before remembering he was supposed to report to Pomfrey. Sighing, he turned around to trudge to the hospital wing. He had a massive on-and-off headache and was beginning to feel a little itchy, however he'd have to pretend to be fine because if he didn't they might change their mind about letting him be alone. He'd have to really do his best to prove to them he was mature enough, and was able to do what they asked without complaint. He just really hoped they didn't take his pranks into account!

Author's note: Hey guys I got a couple questions from some readers and realized I didn't explain a few things as well as I hoped for anyone who did not read the first book; this is entirely my fault and I want to answer these publicly in addition to PMing the readers. Full moons in this story last multiple nights. In one of the HP books Tonks says something about the 'first phase of the moon' made Remus extra grumpy. That, coupled with the fact the moon really looks full more than one night, made me decide to do this. So I have a chart that tells me how much of the moon is visible each night back in the 70s and if the moon is 98% or more then I count that as triggering the lycanthropic curse. While this part is never explained in the series yet, I wanted to clear that up instead of just saying 'yeah the full moon lasts multiple nights'. The second question I got is in regards to whether Lily knows his secret. The answer is, as far as Remus knows she does not. At this point Remus thinks all his friends know is that he and his mother both have a genetic blood disease that flares up 'every now and again'. That is what he told them in his first year. I apologize for any confusion! If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask because I am more than happy to answer!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\When Remus went into the hospital wing he found quite a crowd. Mostly Slytherins. Professor Slughorn was storming back and forth, shouting loudly about stupidity. Remus cowered back, knowing instantly the mandrake thing had been a success. His eyes darted towards some beds. There were a good nine Slytherins out for the count."Horace, if you insist on using my room as a lecture hall I will insist on you leaving!" Pomfrey snapped as she bustled over to one of the beds. "Please remove yourself, as well as all your students, at least the ones who are awake!"Slughorn waddled to the door, mustache twitching. Remus shrank back even more but Slughorn didn't even give him a passing glance, though several of the Slytherins who followed him out sure did."Oh, Mr. Lupin, I'm afraid I can't help you tonight," Pomfrey said once the room was emptied and she could see him. "There's been a bit of a... well, not quite accident...""What—what happened?" Remus went forward a little, looking at the Slytherins with curiosity. There was Mulciber, Avery, and Bulstrode! Hah! And Wicket! The other five were older boys he didn't recognize. No, there was another, a small one—possibly a first year—curled up. Ten Slytherins."It seems someone put a mandrake in one of the dorms," Pomfrey said as she adjusted the position of Wicket, trying to make him more comfortable. Remus thought shoving him out of bed would be a better position. "If you ask me, I think one of these boys stole it himself to—" She stopped short, realizing she was saying this to a student. "Our lesson will have to wait a bit, I'm afraid. I'll let you know when.""All right, M—Madame Pomfrey, th—thank you." He quickly left, trying not to skip the whole way back to the tower. Once he was far enough away he began giggling, excited to tell his friends about this, excited to tell them that Pomfrey seemed to think it was just Mulciber, Avery, or Bulstrode who had done it. Was that was Slughorn had been ranting about, about the stupidity? Oooh!He fell through the Gryffindor's tower's entrance then hopped up, looking around. No sign of the Marauders. He ran up to the dorm (tripping on the steps) except they weren't in there either. Where are they? he thought miserably as he trudged down the stairs to wait near the entrance. He kept fidgeting, trying to read a book though the words jumped around on the page. He was too excited to tell them and hoped they hadn't already heard. They probably did, he thought a bit bitterly.Just before curfew they came in, slight bulges in their pockets. Remus jumped up, running over to them. "Come on!" he said, grabbing Sirius's hand, yanking him towards the stairs, hoping James and Peter would follow which they did."What's got you all excited?" laughed Sirius.They went into the dorm which was thankfully empty. "Did you hear?" Remus let go of Sirius, spinning to face the three of them. "About the Slytherins?"They hadn't so Remus got to tell them everything about the hospital wing, the unconscious Slytherins, Slughorn's rant, Pomfrey's little slip about what she thought. As he spoke his friends took food out of their pockets, belying what they had been up to. When Remus finished talking James pumped his fist."YES! Ohhhh guys, guys, how absolutely brilliant would it be if Mulciber, Avery, or Bulstrode got in trouble for stealing the mandrake on top of everything?!" They all laughed and gave each other high fives."They deserve it, they're such jerks," Peter said, falling back on his bed."What did they look like?" Sirius asked eagerly.Remus shrugged. "Um, unconscious? It just knocks them out, it doesn't really do anything else.""Well, that's still great," James laughed.Sirius was still grinning as he then asked Remus, "How come you were in the hospital wing?"Remus hesitated for a split second, a brief flare of panic going up inside of him. "It's my weekly appointment, remember? Tuesday evenings?""Oh right," Sirius said. "Is that where you were all evening? You missed supper.""Um..." Remus tugged at his sleeve, quickly thinking through his options. "Yes. Actually. I've been there since after Defense." Then he began smiling again, a hopefully good idea going off in his head. It meant some intense lies, but ones that could throw anyone suspecting off the track. "I probably shouldn't be saying this but, um, my mother's doctor put together a potion that might help us.""What?" James and Peter stared at him in happy disbelief, while Sirius's eyes narrowed slightly."Yeah. Honestly, I don't think it will work. But, um, yeah. That's where I was all afternoon, Saint Mungo's. Then I went to Pomfrey for my usual appointment for—"James ran over, grabbing Remus's shoulders. "Brains, that is amazing! Of course it will work, it's got to work!"Remus forced the smile to stay on his face, guilt eating at him for lying so much. "I hope so.""Is it a cure-cure?" Peter asked. "Or is it just to help? Um, make the time you're sick easier?""It probably won't do anything. I think it's supposed to pretty much get rid of our disease," Remus said, trying his best to sound partially hopeful partially despondent.James elbowed him. "Merlin, that's wonderful. It will work.""It will," Peter echoed, squeezing Remus's arm. "You've gotta have hope."Sirius didn't say anything, just gave Remus a big smile which made Remus start to sweat a little. The old panic of does he know? Is he guessing? came back with a vengeance. "I guess we'll find out sometime over the next few months," Remus said."Are you hungry?" Peter went over to the pile of food, sorting it out. "None of us ate much, we were waiting for news about the Slytherins."Sirius started to say something then stopped."I'm a little hungry," Remus said. "Well, I could go for dessert.""Can't we all?" James asked, pulling out a container with some chocolate cake in it. He also had four forks, and they sat on James's bed eating right out of the container, at least the others did. Remus cut off a piece to put on a paper towel to eat by himself because he didn't want to get any wolf spit on the cake that the others might accidentally ingest.They joked about the Slytherins for the most part, at one point James getting up and pretending to faint to try to reenact what might have happened. There was a lot of laughter, squealing, giggling, and for Remus a lot of awkwardness because Sirius kept looking at him, eyes boring into him, boring through his lies it almost felt like. Finally, sick of the stares, Remus flicked some chocolate frosting at Sirius who yelped, then grabbed one of James's pillows to smack Remus nearly off the bed. The cake was abandoned as the four of them jumped around, smacking one another with pillows, feathers flying everywhere./\/\/\/\/\Rumors were whispered throughout Wednesday about the Slytherins. None of them were really correct but the good thing was nobody seemed to suspect anyone outside of Slytherin. Not even McGonagall suspected the Marauders; in Transfiguration she acted completely normal. She snapped at Sirius for once again setting his desk on fire buuut that was pretty much normal. Remus asked Lily what happened, wondering if Snape had told her."I don't know," she sighed as they walked through the corridors. "I haven't seen him. Perhaps Silverlocke will know."Silverlocke did tell study group that evening. They all wanted to know especially since by now the main rumor was that the mandrake was in a second years' dorm.Silverlocke put his elbows on the table, propping his chin up. "I probably should not be talking about this..." He glanced around at the many pairs of wide eyes, and sighed. "We aren't sure exactly what happened. It seems as though a mandrake was stolen from the greenhouses, and found in one of the dorms. The pot was smashed, so the mandrake was crying. It knocked out several of my housemates until someone realized what was going on and went up with earmuffs on. Thankfully most the students who heard the cry were only out of it for a few minutes. Ten of them, I believe, had to go to the hospital for recovery.""Who stole the mandrake?" Buckling asked, sounding angry. She was very good in Herbology and had an affinity with plants."I don't know," Silverlocke informed her. "I am assuming one of the boys whose dorm it was in."Remus pressed his toes against the floor until it hurt, trying his best not to just bust up laughing. Luckily the conversation shifted to their assignments and he was able to calm down, though he did have to suppress a spring in his step on the way back to the tower. He hoped Mulciber and Avery would get the blame for all of this. He would never forgive them for what they had said about his parents a few months ago. Calling Remus's mother a Muggle cow and beast, and saying Remus's father was into animals for 'mating' with one. They had pretty much said the same thing about Peter's parents just in reverse, as Pete's dad was the Muggle."Remus..." Lily began quietly, studiously not looking at him as they walked. "The others can't get into the Slytherin dorms, can they? Your friends, I mean."He fumbled, nearly tripping over nothing. "Of c—course not," he said, managing a smile he hoped wasn't too shaky. "Even if we knew where the common room is, we'd need the password. Even with the password... we'd be seen creeping about in there. Unless the Slytherins all abandon their common room for some reason, which probably would only happen for the Halloween feast, or a Slytherin Quidditch game."Lily nodded. "I thought as much. I—I'm sorry for asking. I just... oh, you know, Potter and Black are so... so... diabolical!""Don't let them hear you say that, they'd take it as a compliment. Probably profess their undying love for you.""Oh, gross!" she moaned while he laughed.In the common room the only other Marauder Remus could see was James who was sitting near the fireplace with two fourth year girls from the Quidditch team. James waved when he saw Remus then went back to their conversation. So Remus sat with Lily, and Macdonald soon joined them, nervously asking for help with some of her homework which they gladly gave. Shortly before curfew Peter came hopping into the common room with a rather murderous looking Sirius slouching behind them."I'll s—see you later," Remus said, gathering his stuff, noticing James was exiting his chat as well. They both went over to the two boys and Peter began yammering on about Photography club, bouncing on the balls of his feet as he spoke so fast he kept messing up his words. Sirius stood behind him, making faces the entire time."So you liked it?" James asked."Oh, yes!" Peter laughed. "It was... very, um, it taught me a lot just from the first meeting. The president also said my pictures were really good." He beamed at this, then turned bright red. "I—I don't know if they're really that good—""Bollocks to that, Pete, they're better than 'really good'," James said, punching Pete's arm."They invited me to join properly," Pete said, grinning again. "Anyone can, um, show up, but I've been invited to be a real member of the club.""Congratulations!" Remus said then looked at Sirius. "I take it you did not have as illuminating a time?""That was one of the most boring things I've ever been through," Sirius grumbled, jamming his hands deep into his pockets, hunching his shoulders. "No offense, Petey. Glad you liked it. Just—Merlin's beard, the only thing worse than that is Binns. I didn't know anyone could talk about developing fluids for ten minutes straight."Pete shifted his weight, scratching his head nervously. "I—I really appreciate you coming with me."Sirius managed a wane smile. "If you... need me to come again, I will..."He shook his head vigorously. "No, um, no. I think I'll be okay. I was just super nervous, you know? It was kinda scary, going in I mean. But with you there I felt a little braver. But I think I'm okay now. To go to the next one by myself.""Oh thank Merlin," Sirius whispered to the side causing Remus to snort./\/\/\/\/\The Slytherins had lost fifty points by breakfast... of course, it had to be a Slytherin. No one else could get into the common room without being seen. The second years looked particularly glum, except for Mulciber and Avery who looked livid. They kept shooting glares at anyone who dared look their way. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were quite happy at least, since this meant both Gryffindor and Slytherin were pretty far behind with points."I think this was one of our best ones yet," James whispered, and the others all nodded in agreement. James and Sirius did enjoy getting caught for smaller pranks as it helped bolster their reputation, but getting away with such an immensely wild prank like this was a very delicious sort of feeling; besides, if they had been caught for this one they'd probably be expelled.After a few more minutes James then announced, "I've got my first practice tonight.""We'll be there!" Sirius replied immediately."Of course we will!" agreed Peter.They all looked at Remus who gave a long sigh. "I'll be there," he reluctantly gave in."Thank you," James said, patting Remus's arm. "I really appreciate it. Ooh, I can't wait...!"The Slytherins were on everybody's lips on the way to Herbology, as well as all the Hufflepuffs. Sprout was in a very furious mood when they got to the greenhouses. She stormed around as everyone piled into Greenhouse Two then began the lesson with a very long lecture on the delicacy of plants, the danger of plants, how terrible it is to steal a plant, etc, etc. She cast a despairing scowl around at all the kids then went into their proper lesson."Blimey," Colgate said as they crept out of the greenhouse afterwards. "She is... intense.""I thought McGonagall was scary!" Sirius exclaimed."Yeah, I always thought Professor Sprout was the easy-going Head," Inkwood said."Hah!" They all turned to see Bones, Pierce, and a couple other Hufflepuffs. "Sprout? Easy-going?" Bones shook his head. "You guys haven't seen anything yet. When she loses her temper... hoo.""Her lectures can blister the ears," said one of the other girls whom Remus thought name might be Smith."You should have seen her when Simon was caught out of bed," laughed one of the boys, possibly named Jha?"You were out of bed?" James and Sirius turned interested eyes to Bones. "Doing what?"Bones grinned sheepishly, rubbing the back of his head. "Donnie and I were sneaking into the kitchens late one night.""We've snuck in plenty of times," said the boy named Donnie, "just got caught the once.""How did you get caught sneaking into the kitchens?" asked Peter. "Isn't your common room like, ten feet away?"The two boys coughed. "It... well, we didn't know Filch was right there when we were coming out," Bones explained. "It just happened so quickly we couldn't do anything.""I pretty much ran right into him," added Donnie. Remus thought for a second then remember his last name was Rivers."We're never caught out of bed," Sirius boasted.Bones rolled his eyes towards Remus who shrugged. "Wait..." Bones straightened up. "Lupin, you've snuck out after curfew?"Now everyone was looking at him. His skin began to itch a little and he took an anxious step back. "Um. A—a couple times. Accidentally.""Not all accidental," James said, elbowing Remus who began blushing."Here I always thought you were this little goodie-two-shoes," said Bones, rubbing his chin."He hangs out with those two and you think he's a goodie-two-shoes?" Lily inquired, raising her eyebrows, causing much laughter among both group of kids while Remus toed the ground, flushing even more."He and Pettigrew might look innocent but they're just as wild," agreed Inkwood. Peter grinned proudly while Remus hunched over, glad his hair covered his eyes.Everyone began talking, mostly Sirius and James exchanging tips with Bones and Rivers about sneaking out. Slowly the other students drifted away then finally the Marauders headed back into the castle, James declaring the two Hufflepuffs were 'pretty darn nice'./\/\/\/\/\That evening Remus sat up in bed, a fresh piece of parchment in front of him as he thought about what to write.Dear Mum and Dad, 14/9/72Dad, I've decided to try to go to the Quidditch games this year. At least Gryffindor's. I don't know how I'll like them. But I'm going to go. I thought you'd be happy to hear that!Remus knew when he was born Lyall had had high hopes his son would become a Quidditch player. Hah. He really wanted to write that he had gone to see a Quidditch practice, maybe make his dad even happier... except he couldn't say why he went, which was to watch his friend. Though he spent most the practice with his nose in a book, occasionally glancing up to watch James flying around. He had no idea what was going on nor did he ask his friends to explain. He hoped the practices went like this in the future, as it wasn't the worst thing in the world.September is about halfway over now. The past two weeks have felt like they've lasted a very long time. In any case, school is going great! Especially Defense Against the Dark Arts! Professor Prewett is very nice to me. He saw my poor grades from last year and feels like perhaps Professor Dedenne was a little unfair towards me, so he is giving me extra homework to see if I deserved those grades or not. I don't know how true this is however if I can make those grades up it would be wonderful.Remus lifted his chin, staring at the far wall. He never told his parents how awful Dedenne was towards him or, or why, so this was a delicate section to write.The lessons are so interesting! I am so happy I came back to school. I can't wait to see how things proceed over this term. I'm actually very excited for Defense, since Professor Prewett is so much better than Dedenne ever was. History is, unfortunately, as boring as ever. I wish we'd get a new teacher for that class.He jerked as a crashing sound distracted him. Struthers was trying to teach James and Sirius how to stand on their heads. Spinnet was also doing it as well, which was nice that he was getting along somewhat with Sirius. James was doing a pretty decent job but Sirius kept crashing."Stop worrying about your hair!" James said, upside down. Spinnet snickered while Sirius scowled.I don't understand how Professor Binns can remain here. I know he was a teacher when he died and it could be fascinating to have a ghost as a teacher but he's just so so so SO boring. We are supposed to be learning about the International Warlock Convention of 1289 which resulted in the violent, fatal duel between Mad Morlingham and Aldred the Annihilated. Which is SUCH a COOL thing! But I know it's just going to be miserably dull coming from Professor Binns.Sirius crashed again, this time into Spinnet sending the two of them tumbling down. Remus thought Spinnet might start yelling but thankfully they both just laughed. It was very nice."C'mon, Pettigrew, you give it a try," Struthers said pleasantly.Study group is down to three times a week though I am spending plenty of time on my own studying. I am grateful the others decided on their own to not spend as much time together. While it is very nice having others to study with, I don't wish to become too familiar with them.More lies.Peter was wobbling about as Struthers tried to help him with his legs. "Hey!" Pete said cheerfully as he managed to stay upright for a few seconds.It's still months away to decide on electives however I am seriously considering trying to take all of them. I just can't decide which ones sound the best. If all of them are too much I can drop some of them. I suppose Muggle Studies would be a little redundant considering most my life has been spent Muggle-esque, but I'd still like it."Lupin, you try now!" Struthers called.Remus glanced up, shook his head, then went back to writing.The moon is next week. I'm glad I had time to acclimatize back to school before having to go through the ordeal again."Awww, Remy, come on, try it!" Sirius wheedled.Professor McGonagall"Remuuuusss!" James drew out."You can do it!" Peter cheered.Remus sighed. "J—just a minute."Professor McGonagallHe frowned. Had his parents been consulted about him remaining in the house alone? Surely they had... right? Perhaps it'd be better not to mention it until he knew for sure.Professor McGonagall wants me to take some lessons with Madame Pomfrey to learn how to bandage myself up which is probably a good idea. Anyway, I best go get back to my homework.Love,RemusHe used a quick drying spell, folded up the parchment, stuck it in an envelope, used a sticking spell to close it, then scrambled off his bed. "You all realize this is a terrible idea for me to try, don't you?" he asked. Struthers explained what to do then Remus bent over, placing his head against one of the pillows on the floor. Sirius grabbed his legs, pulling them up as Remus pressed his hands against the floor for balance. The second Sirius let go his legs began flailing and he crashed back down, kicking Struthers accidentally as he went. "Told you."

Author's note: Okay sorry to bring this up again but I've been having some anxiety issues over my writing. I just finished up writing chapter 48, and it's only Halloween. For comparison, chapter 42 of year one was Christmas. Like I know I said this was long haul and everything, and I like what I've written, but I just want to make sure that this isn't too wild. Like does the fact it takes 48 chapters to get to just Halloween make you go "oh :(" or "oh! :)"? I know a big reason is in this year he has friends now and is actually doing stuff besides studying/hiding but idk I guess my worries are getting to me? Any thoughts or feedback would be very appreciated./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\On Saturday James and Sirius wanted to sneak into Hogsmeade. They begged Remus and Peter to come with them, and Peter quickly gave in once James promised to bring his cloak. Remus, however, refused."I'm sorry, th—there's just a limit to the rules I'll break," he protested, wishing he could go with him. He knew it was probably ridiculous—he had broken so many already, what was this one? Just... it felt like it was a line he should not cross. "Besides, I have detention tonight.""We'll be back before," James promised."S... sorry, no."He had a day to himself which wasn't the worst thing. Professor Prewett had given him a couple new essays to do on Thursday, a little more advanced than the ones he did the first time around, so he went to the library to work although he couldn't concentrate very well since he was anxious about the other Marauders messing with the house. They hadn't mentioned it but the previous time they went in he knew they wanted to try again. He hoped with Peter there they might not... They can't get in, either way... He tapped his quill against the paper, chewing at his bottom lip, foot jiggling. If I can't get out as a wolf, they can't get in. Period.He still felt worried.Finally he gave up trying to work, checking out a few books to take back to his dorm which was lonely without the other Marauders. He still felt blegh so he left to walk around the castle, hands jammed in his pockets. He considered going to the hospital wing to see if Pomfrey could teach him bandaging except he doubted it'd be a good idea to just show up. Then he saw Lily hanging out in a courtyard with Colgate and Inkwood. He joined them, sitting cross-legged on the ground between Lily and Inkwood. Lily was making flower crowns, Colgate was putting color on her nails, and Inkwood was braiding Colgate's hair. Remus regretted immediately joining them as it all seemed so girly, though he rather liked flower crowns."Where are Thing One and Thing Two?" Lily asked."Probably causing trouble," sighed Colgate as she held up a hand to study her fingernails. She waved her wand, saying a strange sounding spell, and her nails faded from bright red to a deep maroon. Colgate crinkled her nose then began tapping her nails individually, making the color disappear."I—I think they're exploring the castle," Remus lied."I'm assuming Pettigrew went with them?" Lily asked and Remus nodded. "How come you didn't?""I, er, wanted to study. Had a hard t—time focusing. No clue where they are so..." He shrugged, trying to pretend like he was pretending not to care he couldn't find them. Layers of deceit."What do you think?" Inkwood asked, pulling a mirror out of her bag. Colgate squealed, clapping her hands, hugging Inkwood. Inkwood smiled, inching over to begin braiding Lily's hair. "Hey, Lupin, question." Inkwood looked over Lily's head, eyes sparkling. "Has Black ever said anything about me?""You?" Remus raised his eyebrows as Lily snorted and Colgate giggled. "Erm..." He thought back to the opening feast, them commenting on Inkwood though he didn't know why. "Not... really... Not that I've noticed.""Oh." Her face fell a little."Why?"Now all the girls were giggling. Inkwood pressed her lips together, bending in closer to Lily's hair."Yeah, Cassie," Lily snickered. "Why?""Shut up!" Inkwood hissed out."Has he said anything about any of us?" Colgate inquired, smirking, shooting glances at Inkwood who seemed to be growing more and more uncomfortable.He now knew what Inkwood wanted, though couldn't really fathom why. Boy-girl stuff. He crinkled his nose a little, thinking yuck. He knew that as they got older it'd become more prevalent... part of him wished it wouldn't happen, part of him wished that it would as soon as possible. That he understood the fascination about girls. That he'd just go through whatever it was he was supposed to go through, step past that invisible barrier and just be a regular boy already. He hated feeling weirder than he already was whenever the Marauders talked about girls which, thank MERLIN, wasn't too often. Yet."Um." He figured if he told them about Sirius, James, and Peter all discussing their chests after seeing them in wet shirts at the end of their previous year it would go very, very poorly. "I really d-don't notice.""Do you talk about girls at all?" Colgate asked, putting new color on her nails."Me spe—specifically?" he asked and she nodded. Remus felt himself growing redder. "I—n—not really. I don't."Colgate met his gaze, her brown eyes wide behind her glasses. "Not even Lily?""Alice!" Lily growled.Now Remus was as uncomfortable as Inkwood looked. "Er...""We're just friends!" Lily said haughtily. Inkwood went 'mmmhmm' while Colgate smirked. Now Lily was blushing too. "I'm sorry, Remus, they're being idiots." She glowered at her friends then threw the flower crown at Colgate. "Here.""Who do they talk about?" Inkwood asked. Colgate rolled her eyes as she put the flower circlet in her hair which looked rather nice with the braids."Themselves, mostly," Remus said, causing Lily and Colgate to bust up laughing and Inkwood to shake her head.Colgate, satisfied with her nails, pulled a pot of paint out of her bag along with a small brush. She lay on her stomach looking into a propped up mirror as she began painting designs on her face.Remus felt eyes on him and looked around, soon spotting three boys sitting on one of the low walls that separated the open courtyard from the corridors surrounding it. Two of the boys were deep in conversation and Remus recognized them, vaguely; the pudgier one was a year older than him, having come to their dorm on a couple occasions when Remus's nightmares were too loud, before the spelled curtains. The gangly redhead Remus knew was called Weasley, as they had been in detention together that horrendous evening when Dedenne went off on Remus. The third boy with them Remus didn't know at all and he was the one watching Remus closely. Until Remus looked. Then the fair-haired boy jerked his head away."Can I paint your face?"Remus jumped a little, realizing Colgate was kneeling in front of him, her own face covered in delicate flowers. "Ah, uh, um, o—okay..." She began sweeping the brush across his cheeks which tickled a bit. He tried not to wriggle then felt eyes on him again. "Um, do any of you know who those boys are over there? I—I think they're th-third years."Colgate looked past him then returned her gaze to his face. "Nope.""The redhead has a filthy mouth," Inkwood complained, finishing up Lily's hair."I think he's a Weasley. They all have orange hair and freckles," Colgate said then her tongue curled out the corner of her mouth as she focused."He's still got a filthy mouth," Inkwood said, flopping back. She shaded her eyes, looking over at the boys. Remus wished he hadn't mentioned them at all."Done." Colgate held up the mirror. Remus took it, afraid he'd be covered in flowers too however instead there were purple and blue flames rising up, smokey sort of swirls around his eyes and forehead. It looked pretty cool. Colgate then put vines on Lily's face, and more vivid flowers on Inkwood's face. They talked about some gossip they read in magazines which Remus didn't join in on. He kept feeling the boy's eyes on him, making him sicker and sicker. He wanted to go over, demand to know why he was being stared at."We should get Black to paint our faces," Inkwood said, tilting her head to look at her flowers. "He's a good artist, isn't he?""Pretty much the only thing he's good at, besides causing trouble," Lily grumbled."Can I see the mirror again?" Remus asked, deciding to give himself a distraction to stop thinking about that boy. Inkwood handed it over and Remus held it up with his left hand while he pointed his wand at his face. It took a couple tries but soon the flames were flickering and the smoke wafted around like it was real. The girls all gasped then clamored for him to animate their own face paint. Soon the vines were growing around Lily's face, slithering a little bit like snakes, while the flowers on Colgate and Inkwood's faces swayed like there was a breeze. Colgate added a butterfly to her own face and a hummingbird to Inkwood so Remus animated them as well. Lily wanted something else as well but they couldn't think of anything to go with the vines so Colgate just painted a cat which Remus animated.Once that was all done Remus glanced to the wall, pleased to see the three boys were gone./\/\/\/\/\"What the hippogriff hell is on your face?"Remus had come back from detention to find the other Marauders in the dorm, all of them gaping at the purples and blues moving about on his skin. He had gone the entire day with the face paint on, doing his best to ignore the strange looks other students sent his way. When he had gone to detention the teacher in charge—one he didn't know, a rather round older man with a jovial personality—just laughed. Remus had to write lines for this detention. I must not set other students on fire. Which was quite amusing when one had flames on their face. Snape was in the same detention and Remus caught a glimpse of his paper. I must not cut other students. At least that detention had gone a million times better than the only other time Remus had had to write lines.Now he was facing the Marauders who had been excited as soon as Remus walked in but now were just staring at his face making him feel like he had done something wrong."It's moving," Peter said."I enchanted it," Remus replied with a sniffle. "Colgate did the paint. I enchanted it."Looks cool," Peter said at the same time James said, "Looks weird."James shrugged when everyone looked at him. "Why purple? Be better with actual fire colors. Or red and gold.""Not everything has to be Gryffindor," Remus complained."But it should," James laughed."Anyway!" Sirius clapped his hands for attention. "First off, prezzies." He picked up a small bag, handing it to Remus with a bit of a dramatic flourish. "This is stuff from all of us.""You didn't need to get me anything!" Remus argued."Too late," Pete laughed. "Come on, then."Remus sat down, trying not to grin too much as he pulled the presents out. A box of every flavor beans from Peter, a bottle of butterbeer from Sirius, and—"James!" Remus snarled."What?" James asked innocently.He pulled the Gryffindor jumper out of the bag, glaring at James. "I c—can't accept this! It's too expensive!" It was a deep scarlet with gold trim and the outline of a roaring lion's head on the front."Naw!" James flapped his hand. "It wasn't that much. Look at it this way, it was only ummm..." He began counting on his fingers. "Erm... well, compared to my allowance it wasn't much. Besides, you can wear it to my first game! It's a selfish present."Is not, Remus thought, standing up to hold the jumper up against his body. It looked like it would fit him pretty well, only a tiny bit large. He had never had anything brand new that fit him. Anything brand new was too big, and anything that fit him was old. He took off the jumper he was wearing—struggling a bit with keeping his t-shirt on that had been underneath—and put the new one on. It did fit him."Looks good," Sirius said, sounding weird, a strange expression flitting across his face for a second.Remus ducked his head. "Still too expensive. It's brand new.""It was on clearance," James said."What? No, it wa—" Peter started then James jumped on him, covering his mouth.Remus smiled. "I already heard him.""He's an idiot," James said as Peter flailed. "He doesn't even know what clearance means."Peter pushed James's hand away then gave Remus a wide-eyed look. "It's true. I don't. I have no idea at all what that means!" he exclaimed way over the top, probably taking too many queues from Sirius.Remus rolled his eyes then ran his fingers across his stomach. It was such a soft sweater. "Thank you... but... you—you really don't need to... get me things like this. Even the sweets and butterbeer are too much!""Yeah, how dare you spoil your friends, Jimmy," Sirius said, putting his hands on his hips. "You're so mean."James flopped on Remus's bed, getting into the every flavor beans. "Oh no, however will I live with myself now? Blimey, Remy, how long can you rub your stomach?"Remus jerked, flushing slightly as he dropped his arms to his sides. "It's... really soft."James just smiled. "I'm glad you like it."Remus pulled it off so he could get it washed. The tee underneath was big enough that the sleeves covered his scar, otherwise he'd never have done this in front of the others. He put his original one back on, putting the new one in the laundry basket. "What did you guys get up to? Did you enjoy Hogsmeade, Pete?""It was amazing!" Pete flung himself onto Remus's bed next to James. "Honeydukes is absolutely incredible! You need to come with us next time. There was this model replica of Hogwarts that was this big!" He stretched his hand up while James began gagging on a bad bean. "Aisles of sweets, like so many, some of it's so expensive. Oh! They have this whole line of gummy animals! Griffons, unicorns, hippogriffs, nifflers—OH!" Pete jumped up, clapping his hands excitedly. "There was this dragon that breathed out cotton candy fire. Except it's not really cotton candy, it's this other stuff and it was spicy. The clerk let us have a taste.""Pete was crying," Sirius said, sitting on the edge of his own bed.Pete glared. "Only a little bit, it was really spicy. The Three Broomsticks is super neat too. Hot butterbeer is good. And the barkeep's got really big knockers." He held his hands out in front of his chest. "And the chips are amazing. The best I've ever had. Remus, you really need to come with us next time."Remus dug into the beans until he found one that seemed fairly safe. Since his bed was mostly taken over he sat next to Sirius. "What else did you do?" He studied the bean carefully, giving it a cautious sniff. "Zonko's?""Um, yes!" James got up, running to his bed to dump a huge bag full of pranks onto his mattress. "I think I spent most the rest of this month's allowance there.""Quidditch store," Sirius said, taking the bean from Remus's hand and tossing it into his mouth. "Blueberry.""I finally pick a good one and you steal it!" Remus huffed. Sirius just grinned. "Anywhere else?""Clothes, obviously," James said, going back to Remus's bed. "Music. Got a new record."Peter handed the beans over and Remus picked out another one, identical to the one he had before. "Is that it?" He hoped he sounded merely curious and not demanding."About it," Sirius said. "The haunted house."Remus tried to seem not too overly interested. "Oh?""It's so creepy," Peter said, eyes going huge. "Merlin, it's scary. It looks like it's been there for ages but it's new? It doesn't look new though.""We should one hundred percent sneak out at night sometime to hear the screams," James said as he tossed a bean into the air, trying to catch it in his mouth. It bounced off his face, clattering to the floor. Remus ate his own bean then began gagging at the medicinal taste which made his friends laugh."Wh—why would you want to—to do that?" he choked out, eyes watering a bit. He flicked the half-chewed bean into the rubbish bin."Are you kidding?!" Sirius demanded. "Hear the screams of the souls of the damned? Sign me up!"Remus scrambled for a bottle of water. "So sneaking out to Hogsmeade isn't enough, you want to do it after hours!?" He took a quick swig, gagging again. "You lot are absolutely mental. Like, more than mental. No, I won't have it. You're not doing that.""Jeez, calm down there, Brains," laughed James, tossing a bean his way. Remus fumbled with it then picked it up off the floor, wiping it off. "What's it matter if we sneak off into Hogsmeade at night anyway? Either way we're breaking tons of rules. And I want to hear the screams." James picked another bean while Remus spat out his disgusting bean, taking another swig of water. "We should do it during the full moon."Remus spit out his entire mouthful of water, all over the floor, some of it spraying against James and Peter. "Wh—wh-wh-why w-would you—you d-d-do th—that?!""Um... because it'd make it even scarier?" James asked, wiping the water off his jeans. "Or Halloween.""H—Halloween," Remus rasped out, trying to pretend that Sirius wasn't staring at him. "Halloween would be even scarier. I—I bet that's—that's when the screams are the—the... scariest? The most damned, certainly.""Aw, but then we'd miss the feast," whined Peter.James shook his head. "Nah, we could go after the feast. Be there at midnight.""Wouldn't that make it November first and not Halloween?" Sirius asked with a smirk. "Shouldn't we go there on October thirtieth, then, and be there when it's midnight and turns over to the thirty-first?""No way," James argued. "Halloween lasts till dawn. Ooh! Speaking of Halloween we need to figure out our prank this year because fireworks are not going to cut it..."They began discussing ideas of pranks to pull at the Halloween feast which was much safer territory than going to the house in Hogsmeade during a full moon. Remus fought to keep his hand from shaking as he took another sip of water. His heart was racing at a million miles an hour and he sort of wanted to cry. James's words repeated in his head, the image of them going to the house filled his entire brain. The hazy thought of them doing this felt like it was trying to peel off some of his skin, clawing into him, digging deep. His stomach was hurting even worse, bile rising up.It really didn't help that Sirius's eyes kept drifting back to Remus, studying him."S—scuze me, I-I need to..." Remus got up, quickly leaving the dorm, running into the bathroom. He banged into one of the stalls and crashed to his knees, vomiting into the toilet. He flushed then slid to the ground, pulling his top up over his face so he could weep quietly. Of course Sirius followed him in. "It w-was a—a very bad—bad bean," he moaned.Sirius's shoes stopped outside the stall door. "Is that what upset you?""Up... set? I'm not upset," Remus croaked out, wiping his dribbling nose off on the fabric. His skin began to feel itchy."Can I come in?""N... no?" Remus pushed his hand up his other sleeve and began scratching at his arm, trying desperately to stop the sensation."Oh. Well. Um. Okay. If you need anything, um, yeah. I'm here for you, okay?"He dug his nails in as deep as they could go, tears welling up, wishing he could just be NORMAL. That he could be distressed without feeling like his skin wasn't his own. "Yeah, th—thanks. I'm fine though. Bad bean.""Right."He left the bathroom and Remus let out a slightly relieved sigh. He yanked his top back down, slowly getting up so he could wash his face off. It was obvious Sirius knew something was up, Remus just hoped he hadn't sussed it yet. He looked at his pale reflection, knowing he had overreacted. Spitting out the water like that. He needed to take things in stride. Freaking out like that only made things worse.He washed his face again, forced his lips into a smile, and returned to the dorm./\/\/\/\/\It was the full moon. Wolf-Remus paced in the house, drool dripping out onto the bloodied floors as he heard voices outside the walls. His friends. They were trying to get in, to find the cursed ghosts. Somehow they got one of the windows open, climbing in. Remus waited in the darkness, muscles tense. He watched as they made their way into the house, pointing out all the blood everywhere. They came into the living room, Sirius in the lead. I knew it! he shouted, pointing at Remus who lunged forward. Sirius screamed, begging for mercy as Remus pinned him to the floor. Sirius thrashed while James and Peter cried out, grabbing at Remus, trying to pull him off. A drop of slobber landed on Sirius's terrified face as Remus bent his muzzle in. He stretched his mouth open, jaws surrounding Sirius's head, then crunched down, hot blood spurting everywhere—"NOOO! Stay AWAY! Go AWAY! Please—I'm—s-s-sorry—"He jerked upright, gasping for air then immediately began clawing at his jaw, still tasting Sirius's blood in his mouth. No... his own blood... he had bitten his tongue in his sleep. He fell back, sobbing."I'm f—fine!" he cried out when Sirius approached his bed. "I'm fine, j-just go back to bed!" He didn't want to see Sirius. He could still see Sirius underneath him, head disappearing in his mouth, hearing the sound of his fangs going into his skin, the feel of his skull crushing.Sirius got into Remus's bed, ignoring his pleas. "Remus, what happened?" he asked.Remus curled up away from him. "Just a nightmare. Fine. I'm f-f-fine.""You definitely don't sound fine.""I'm not... I mean, I am. I—I'm okay. Please." He couldn't look at him. He knew what he'd see if he did. Gouges in his face.Sirius touched his arm. "Remy—"He pulled away, on the very edge of his bed now. "I can't. Please just go back to bed. Please.""Remy, it can't be... normal to—"That set him on edge. He sat up, glaring at Sirius. "Then put the damned spells on your curtains!"Sirius recoiled. His face was smooth. No bite marks. No blood. "Th—that isn't what I was meaning. I said it all wrong. I was trying to say that you sound really... scared. Like... really, really scared. You normally don't sound great but this seems worse than you've had in a while."Remus breathed in and out slowly, trying to keep himself calm. "It doesn't matter. It's merely nightmares.""Merely?" Sirius raised his eyebrows. "Come on. You can tell me about them."Sure, let me just tell you that I literally bit your face off, he thought bitterly. Then all the anger ebbed out of his body and he slumped down, rubbing his eyes. "I don't remember them.""Liar," Sirius said very flatly.Remus glanced back up, then away as he didn't want Sirius's accusing eyes meeting his own fearful ones. "Doesn't matter. Even if I did remember them I don't want to talk about them."Sirius remained silent for several seconds, breathing a little hard. Obviously annoyed. Remus wanted to snap at him again but kept his tongue. Finally he sighed. "All right. Just know that—that I'm willing to listen. To anything you need to talk about. If it's stuff you don't want the others to know about, I can keep a secret."Remus struggled for a few seconds, head hurting, chest hurting, skin still not feeling right from earlier. "They're usually about... my illness..." he whispered, laying back down, back to his friend, not wanting to look at him again. "Okay?""Oh.""Being bedridden," he quickly added, regretting immediately saying anything. "Wasting into nothing.""Remy...""Or, or my mum... wasting away. Dying. Th—that sort of thing. Not always. Just usually. I don't...""Yeah," Sirius said quietly. "I know, you don't like talking about that. Thank you for, um, sharing that with me. I'm not gonna judge or anything. I definitely won't tell the others.""Thank you.""Do you... need me to stay with you for a bit? Maybe chat about other things again?""I just want to be alone right now.""'Kay." Sirius shifted his weight. "If you need anything just wake me up.""Okay, thank you."He heard Sirius retreat to his own bed then quickly got Gwyllgi out from under his pillows. He still tasted the blood.

Author's Note: Thank you so so much everyone who answered my question from the previous chapter. I was so overwhelmed by all the support and love you guys sent my way, and I appreciate it so so much. I think I replied to everyone haha. I know I said this in most to all of my responses, but I tend to get anxiety easily and for some reason I really just let it get to me this time. It was a very silly worry in hindsight but I guess that happens. I love what I write but I do get uncertain about it all the time and question myself. I feel so much better about how I'm writing, and happy that it's not 'dragging on' (as I feared). Thank you again everyone for the incredible show of love and support. It really meant a lot to me 3 and ironically I feel like after such a happy author's note I should give a warning that this chapter is pretty depression-focused. :T/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus couldn't be around the other Marauders the next morning. When he woke up he felt overwhelmed with anxiety, sadness, and his skin crawled at the thought of having to be around people. He tried to pretend to be asleep which worked for a little while until James literally shook him. He rolled over, mumbling that he wasn't feeling well and wanted to stay in bed. Finally they left him alone, though he suspected they'd be back soon. He got out of bed, throwing clean clothes on, shoving a blanket into his school satchel so he could take it with him. He went into a small secret room one of his ghost friends had shown him the previous year. He spongified the floor so it wouldn't be so hard and curled up, falling back asleep.He woke up to find two sets of eyes on him."Yaaah!" He jumped, crashing into the far wall after bouncing a bit.Myrtle began giggling. "Didn't mean to startle you.""H—hi Myrtle, hi Theodore," he said, rubbing the back of his head as he looked back and forth between the two youngest ghosts he knew at the school. Myrtle was only about fourteen when she died, maybe thirteen he wasn't entirely sure. She had died fairly recently, just about thirty years ago. Theodore was about sixteen when he died, about two hundred years ago. He didn't speak much."Theodore told me you looked miserable," Myrtle said rather cheerfully. She seemed to enjoy it when other people weren't doing well. "I thought we could cheer you up." Theodore gave Remus a rather apologetic look."Oh. I'm all right." He rubbed his eyes then shifted his weight a bit so his leg wasn't so close to Myrtle. He didn't particularly like the cold sensation of going through a ghost."What's wrong? You looked awful when you were asleep," Myrtle said then her eyes widened. "Is it because your friends are in trouble?""No, I just haven't been fe—what?" He jerked forward. "What did they do now?!"She began giggling. "Caught putting sticking spells on toilets."Remus sighed, rubbing his forehead, feeling exhausted just at the mere thought of them causing mayhem yet again; though, it didn't surprise him at all. This is what I get for leaving them by themselves for five minutes... "All three of them?""No, just the one in glasses and the cute one." Myrtle clasped her hands around her knees, looking rather dreamy. "You should bring him to visit me again sometime soon.""I... I'll try..."They talked for a bit more then Remus wriggled his way out of the room because even talking to ghosts was a bit much, which was a bad sign in his opion. He was rather flushed from the effort of crawling out of the entrance. It was just a small hole on the wall behind a stone bench. He pushed the bench back into place then went to the tower to hide out under his bed for a while. He curled up with his blanket wrapped around him, clutching Gwyllgi, staring blankly at the gap between his bed and the floor. He knew he should work on his assignments, practice wand movements, do something besides lay there like a lump... but laying there like a lump seemed a much better idea than anything else.It felt as though there was a wheel inside of his head, slowly circling... like a waterwheel. It dipped down into his misery to pull a new thought out, slowly rose, fell, then deposited the thoughts back into the river of bleghness. Most the thoughts were about James's words the night before, and also Sirius's stares. At least Peter hadn't done anything.He buried his face against Gwyllgi, wishing, as always, he could be more normal. Like now, all he was able to do was lay here with the crushing weight of sadness pushing him down. He figured his friends got really sad but they seemed to be able to be more... more... free. Laugh, joke, run around, not appear to have the entire universe pressing into them. Course they're not monsters, he thought miserably. They weren't bound down by a curse or having something so violent pacing deep inside of them ready to come hurtling out without warning. Plus all the other weird issues he had. His weird skin feelings, the extreme anxiety, the sensation of blades digging into his soul, the need to hide like this..."I'm just broken," he whispered to his stuffed dog. He twisted the toy around to look into its shiny black eyes, wishing Gwyllgi were real. He yearned for a living, breathing companion he could talk to—even if was a dog—and put his head against, one that wouldn't run away.Rocky doesn't, he thought, biting his lip as his mind drifted to Hagrid's dog.Before he knew what he was doing he was leaving the castle, heading across the grounds towards Hagrid's hut. His heart pounded in his chest as his feet slowed, wondering if he was really gonna do this. Hagrid would probably just laugh at him. Still, he raised his fist and knocked.Hagrid—wearing a rather frilly yellow apron and holding a spatula—opened the door. "Young Lupin!" he exclaimed cheerfully. "What brings yeh here? Deliverin' a message?""N-no, s—sir," Remus stammered out."I'm sorry, I can't hear yeh.""No, sir," Remus repeated, loudly. "I—I was wondering if..." Now he couldn't do it. It sounded so stupid!"Wonderin' what?" Hagrid inquired, studying the tiny boy. "Why don't yeh come in?" He stepped back and Remus went into the hut, smelling cookies baking. Rocky barked, running over to barrel into him, knocking him clean to the floor. "Rocky, be good! Yer bigger'n him," Hagrid said, apologizing for his dog as he picked Remus up, setting him on his feet."No, it's f-fine." Remus pet Rocky's fluffy head, smiling. "I—well, I was w-wondering if... maybe... I mean..." Ugh James and Sirius could probably easily ask, why couldn't he?"Would yeh like a cookie?"So Remus sat down with a freshly baked sugar cookie which actually tasted really good (the last time he had tried Hagrid's baking it hadn't gone so well). Hagrid rambled for a little while about various things. Baking, his garden, the weather. Finally, after Remus finished off a fourth cookie (he hadn't had breakfast) Hagrid asked him what was on his mind.Looking down into his half-empty teacup, Remus got the nerve to finally talk. "I was wondering if m—maybe I could walk R-Rocky?"Hagrid was quiet for a second which made Remus think he had definitely overstepped but then the groundskeeper began laughing. "Of course! Rocky would love bein' took for a walk! Go on, then, and don't worry 'bout him being loose'n all, he'll stay by yeh.""I can?" Remus looked up, face brightening.Hagrid smiled behind his heard. "I think it'd be good for him." Hagrid went over to a cupboard, pulling out a smallish baggie of treats. Rocky sat down, wagging his tail. Hagrid tossed him one then gave the bag to Remus. "Jus' don't go into the forest.""I won't!" Remus tucked the bag in his pocket. "Come on, Rocky!"He left, not really noticing that Hagrid was frowning now. Rocky bounded along beside him, going in circles, barking happily. Remus beamed at the dog's excitement. They began running along (Remus tripping on occasionally) then stopped near the lake. Remus found a large stick, throwing it as hard as he could which was a pretty decent amount. Rocky ran after the stick, bringing it back, tail wagging. After a bit they ran around together, Remus grabbing at Rocky as he barked and banged into Remus. Finally they collapsed down to rest. They were along a far side of the lake, away from where most students hung out, and there were loads of shrubbery around so Remus allowed himself to do what he truly wanted to do.He rolled over, put an arm around Rocky, and buried his face into his fur. Rocky tossed his head back, wriggling a bit until he was able to awkwardly lick at the side of Remus's head, tail thumping against Remus's legs. Remus let out a soft sound, resisting the urge to hug tighter. The feel of a warm-blooded creature snuggled up like this was too much, and soon he began crying. Rocky jerked away suddenly. Remus thought he had done something wrong but the dog just lay back down next to Remus, giant tongue licking away the tears. Remus put his arm back around him."Good boy," he murmured. "What a good boy." Rocky's tail began wagging again. "You don't think I'm broken, do you?" Slurp, slurp, wag, wag. "Probably think I'm more like you than anyone else at this school. You know, you're a wolfhound: you should be attacking me." Rocky put his head down on top of Remus's head. "You don't care how wrong I am..." He stroked Rocky's fur gently as a bit of drool went in his hair. "I mean... they say they don't... but... sometimes I feel like... it's not true... I know one day I'm just going to—to do something so... wrong... it'll be too much for them. Though, maybe it's for the best. I'm just so screwed up they leave me, be the best option. Honestly, I don't even know how they can put up with me and all my—wrongness. My inability to even be a functional human. I don't understand it at all."He closed his eyes, clinging to the dog."Everyone says I shouldn't be friends with them. Well, Mum and Dad just say I shouldn't have friends, they don't know about them. But... I don't know... if I can do it." He felt more tears coming. "When the time comes... I don't know if I'll be able to... end our... friendship. So, if they do... that'd be... b... best..."Choking a little, he pushed himself into a kneeling position, putting his hands on either side of Rocky's face as the dog panted. "The thought of losing them makes my entire being hurt. Is that normal, Rocky?" Rocky licked his nose. Remus sighed. "Maybe it was a mistake. I thought it'd be nice. To have friends. To... know what friends even are, outside what books say. To know how it feels. I thought it'd be easy to break things off. But it won't be. I don't want to. It's so stupid. I shouldn't... feel like this... I should just keep my distance but... I—I care about them. More than... I probably should... I don't know. How do people feel about their friends?" Rocky barked and Remus gave a tiny smile, scratching behind his ear. "I know how you feel. Absolute love and loyalty, eh?"He froze then slumped back, a little slack-jawed. "Is... that why I feel so close to them? Is it my canine? Latching onto them, like a dog does?" He stared at Rocky, trying to sort through this new thought. "Wolves... bond..." he muttered. "Am I...? N... no. No, that's ridiculous..."Wasn't it?He dropped his hands, looking down at his lap. "Doesn't matter, in any case. They're probably better off without me anyway." Now Rocky whined, nudging Remus with his snout. "It's true. They're human. I'm not. It isn't fair to them." Remus began scratching at Rocky's head again. "I'm too scared of changing it though. I mean, my friendship with them. I like them too much. I guess I'm just selfish." He bent in, putting his forehead against Rocky's. Rocky licked his chin. "It's nice. This is. I don't have to worry about you finding out. I don't have to worry about... giving it away, of making a mistake, of putting a foot wrong. I'm constantly on edge with them. Terrified." He ran his fingers through the curly fur then flopped back down onto the ground with Rocky curling up next to him. "Every time they touch me I keep thinking somehow they'll just... know... Every time they give me a weird look I think, did they just figure it out? Then I go and do stupid stuff like—like spit out the water, like I did last night, at the mere mention of the full moon." Though he knew it was more of the moon in connection with his house that had done it. "Dad's right. I've gotten so lax. I try to do better. Because... I'm so scared. But too selfish to do anything about it. Merlin's beard, I am a total broken freak, aren't I, then?"He kept stroking Rocky's side until Rocky rolled onto his back. Remus smiled and began rubbing his belly. "You like that? Yeahhhh, you like that, huh? Maybe I'll get a dog, when this is all over. A nice dog, like you. One that likes me. Arthur's a great owl and all but... he's so old it's hard to really do much with him. Plus I enjoyed running with you."Rocky barked happily."Just, surround myself with dogs." Remus snuggled up with Rocky once more. "Suits me since I'm a canine anyway, huh?"/\/\/\/\/\When Remus returned to the school—utterly emotionally drained him his confessional with Rocky—he ran into the other Marauders. He could tell immediately something was up though he wasn't sure what. Drat, he thought, quickly looking down. He had hoped to return back under his bed without being seen."Remus!"He stopped in his tracks, still looking at the floor as they approached him. "Hey," he mumbled, tugging at the hem of his sweatshirt."Is something wrong?" James asked immediately.Remus jerked his head up, perplexed. "Wh—what?" He couldn't figure out how they sensed that immediately!The three of them exchanged wary looks. "Um," Peter began, "it's just we just saw Hagrid and—and he asked if we had a fight cause he said you showed up at his hut seeming pretty, um, lonely?"He stiffened, clenching his teeth a little. He couldn't believe Hagrid had just... done that! He figured the man meant well however it still felt like a betrayal. "I wanted to walk Rocky, that's all," he grumbled."Is that all?" Sirius asked, folding his arms."Yes, that's all." Remus was staring at the floor again."You're not mad at us?" James inquired."No, of course not," he promised, then decided to try a joke to maybe distract them. "Though I should be, since I heard you were putting sticking spells on the toilets."Sirius and James snickered then Sirius said, "So, we're going to go mess around outside?" He indicated James who pulled a Quaffle out of his bag.Remus hesitated. He still felt crawly all over, not really wanting human company. Rocky was nice but that was entirely different from the other Marauders. "Um, well... h-have fun." He gave them a smile, hoping that would be that."Aren't you coming with us?" Pete asked.There was a flare of panic at those five words. He most certainly did not want to. He wanted to be alone, away from his friends, under his bed. However... while they had told them before if he needed to be alone it'd be fine, he also suspected that doing so at this moment would be detrimental, as they'd probably think he was mad at them. The crawly skin feeling grew worse. The panic grew worse."Um." He hoped one of them would say 'it's okay if you don't' which meant of course none of them did. He looked at each of their faces then down at the ground. "Yeah, um, of course."The other three ran off while Remus jogged along behind them to keep up. He hoped if they were kicking around the ball while he just sat nearby he'd be okay. He found a spot on the grass, hugging his knees, watching them play with the Quaffle. They kept asking him to join in to which he'd shake his head. He just felt worse and worse, twisting his fingers into the hem of his shirt, trying to breathe, trying not to scratch at himself. Every time they spoke to him it felt almost physically painful which just made him feel even crummier. Finally after sufficient time had passed he stood up, brushing the grass off his trousers as he said something about wanting to do some homework and he'd see them later. They all wished him luck and he gladly left, hurrying to the dorms so he could hide out under his bed.I should talk to Fawley about this, he thought, staring at his hands. Whether this is how... typical people react... But he doubted it was, unless everyone was a better actor than him.He rolled onto his back, pressing his hands against the slats under his bed, feeling the pressure through his arms as he pushed lightly. I just need to try harder, he decided, curling his fingers a little to dig his nails into the wood. If I just try harder maybe I can be normal...Remus woke up with a jerk when loud laughter tore him from his hazy dreams, wondering what time it was. The other Marauders had come tearing into the dorm, Sirius and James laughing while Peter was begging James for forgiveness. Remus shrank back under his bed, trying to keep himself quiet while they talked. After some vague conversation he understood that Peter had kicked the Quaffle so hard that it smashed James's nose in, breaking it. They had gone to the hospital wing to get it fixed, and Peter felt bad. James obviously didn't care. He kept insisting it was a 'brilliant show of strength' and 'you should kick Snivellus like that'. Then James started making 'waPOW!' sounds as Remus watched his foot flying everywhere pretending to kick stuff, then actually kicked stuff. He kicked a pair of jeans laying on the ground, then a pillow, then one of Remus's books sending it skittering across the floor."Ah, bloody hell! Oops!" James ran after it. "Well, if he wasn't mad at us before he will be now. Okay, don't think it's broken.""How can you break a book?" Peter asked."Tearing it.""He's not mad at us," Sirius said from his bed. "He's just not doing well right now.""Why you say that?" James asked as he carefully set the book where it was."He wasn't feeling well last night and he had a bad nightmare," Sirius explained. "He's not in a great... mood. I don't think it's us.""Is he okay?" Peter asked, going over to sit on Sirius's bed next to him."Considering the fact he's run off again, I highly doubt it," James retorted.Remus didn't like this. He was curious to know what his friends had to say about him, but it felt very wrong to be listening in to their conversation. All right, so I eavesdropped a lot last year, he thought with chagrin, but I need to stop. Still, letting himself be known also seemed rather awkward."He's probably just in the library," Sirius yawned."Maybe he's getting sick again," Peter suggested and then something must have happened that Remus couldn't hear because he then went, "What?"Silence. "Nothing," Sirius said slowly. "Maybe he is but honestly he doesn't... really... look it. I think he's just upset.""Maybe we can do something to make him feel better!" Peter clapped his hands. "Let's get him some cookies or something, from the kitchens.""That sounds like a great idea," laughed Sirius, jumping off his bed. "Surprise him when he comes back. Chocolate cookies.""Let's get peanut butter cookies too," said James as the Marauders all got their shoes back on."He likes chocolate, dummy," Sirius said, "so we're getting chocolate cookies."James snorted. "Merlin, I said 'too', dummy. I know he prefers chocolate. I said too.""Ooh, sugar cookies!" Pete said, excited. "With icing."Sirius groaned, walking towards the door with the other two following. "Blimey, this is supposed to be for Remus!""It is. See, we get a variety then he can have all the chocolate ones," said James rather slyly. "It's for him."Remus covered his mouth, trying not to laugh at that logic. Sirius made a scoffing sound, opening the door. "Fine, fine. You win."They left the dorm, door swinging shut. Remus waited a few minutes then scooted out from under the bed. He still felt skin-crawly, anxious, and upset but he also felt sprinkles of pure joy at how kind his friends were being. He gave it a little more time then left the dorm, creeping down the stairs to scan the common room. No Marauder in sight. He hurried out, dodging down a side corridor and finding a secret passageway to hole up in for about an hour with a book. When he returned to the dorm they were back and he acted super surprised to find a big platter of cookies on his desk. He sat down on the edge of his bed, nibbling a chocolate cookie (not even really realizing literally all he had to eat that day were cookies), feeling very grateful to have such good friends, wishing he could be a better one for them.

Author's note: Yup another A/N but this one is to do with the chapter. There is some discussion of mental health in this chapter, and I've tried to do it as sensitive as I could but also keeping in mind Remus is only 12, and this is the 70s. So there is use of the word 'crazy' directly linked to mental health. Also, I know things are really sucky right now and I want to encourage anyone who might be thinking about needing therapy to maybe look into it. There's nothing wrong with seeking help. Sending my love out to you! Also I'm working a couple days a week again so probably no extra chapter. Sorry :(/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus felt a lot better in the morning. His skin wasn't betraying him, he felt a lot calmer... though he felt disgusting for not being able to feel like this the day before. Still, he wanted to talk to Miss Fawley about this. He hoped he'd have the guts to! Was it because he wasn't human that he wound up feeling like that? He couldn't imagine people feeling that way. He never saw anyone reacting the same way he did. So either they didn't, and he was a freak, or they did, and he was just too pathetic to deal with it properly.A note came in during owl mail, asking to show up to the hospital wing to see Pomfrey in the evening. He frowned at this then during lunch went by to ask if it'd be okay if he showed up after study group. He didn't want to seem ungrateful or anything, just... really wanted to be at study group as much as he could."I understand," Pomfrey said. "Of course, seven is fine."The Marauders were waiting for him in the Great Hall and he partially lied to them, saying he had to see Pomfrey that evening over some blood work. Peter wanted to know if it was about the 'cure' Remus had taken before so he seized on that idea, nodding, saying that that was why he needed some extra blood work done this week. To check out if he's had any progress. He felt a little hollow as he spoke, realizing that Sirius definitely didn't look like he believed Remus one bit. James's smile looked a bit fake too... or was it his imagination?Of course the maybe-not-real smile was replaced with a genuine as James asked, "So you won't need to go tomorrow night?" He had Quidditch practices on Tuesday evenings now and wanted Remus there."Um, n—not sure yet, I guess I'll see tonight," he replied with a smile. Definitely fake.The edgy feeling came back, and he felt super nervous around his friends the rest of the afternoon. He regretted now the lies of the 'cure', seeing how stupid and rash it had been. At the time it sounded fine. Now it just sounded dumb, and made more work for him. But he also worried if he didn't add anything else then that might also seem suspicious—the same thing over and over. If he never said anything else, that would be strange. If he did, those lies could be sussed out. It was a never-ending loop of lies and fear, and he wasn't sure how to stop—short of cutting them out of his life.Which he would do...... ... Eventually./\/\/\/\/\After study group Remus headed to the hospital wing then froze in place, seeing the three Marauders sitting outside. He ducked behind a wall, swearing quietly to himself. What are they doing there!? He peered round the corner but they were still there. They looked perfectly fine. Had someone else gotten hurt? Had they got into a fight and the victims were in the hospital wing, and they told to sit outside? Or... were they waiting for him?Remus waited a couple more minutes then knew he couldn't put it off any longer. He took in a deep breath then went out, pretending to be startled seeing his friends."What are you doing here?" he asked, hugging his satchel to his chest. "Did one of you get hurt?"Sirius smiled. "I thought we'd come give you some support."Remus's eyes darted to each of their faces then down to the floor. "Oh, er, th—thank you. I... I don't know if Pomfrey would—would want you around. You know how she gets about visitors.""Yeah, but you're just getting blood stuff done, aren't you?" Pete asked, shuddering. "Surely she'd let us stay for that? Ooh, you know how Muggles take blood? My grandpa's told me. They take this great big needle and shove it into your arm and suck it up."James and Sirius both recoiled. "How barbaric!" James moaned, rubbing his arm uncomfortably."How does the needle get blood in it?" Sirius asked."I don't know, I'll have to ask my grandpa," Pete replied."I—I think they're hollow," Remus mumbled, wanting to point out the magic way of getting blood drawn wasn't too different; it was just a spell that poked through your skin instead of a needle. "It is just simple blood work. It... it'll probably be yucky. You—you don't need to come in or anything, it's not—"James slapped Remus's back. "Nonsense. That's what friends are for." He kept his arm around Remus as he headed through the doors, pulling Remus along. Peter scurried next to them, Sirius following behind. Remus could feel Sirius's eyes on him. Ugh.Madame Pomfrey was changing one of the beds, looking up, eyebrows raising when she saw Remus wasn't alone. "Um, they... they wanted to... be with me while I g—got my blood work done," he said quickly, still clutching at his satchel, trying his best to convey help! with his eyes.Pomfrey straightened up, putting her hands on her hips. "Absolutely not."James's arm fell away from Remus. "What?""How come?!" Peter demanded. Sirius just remained silent."This is a private appointment between myself and Mr. Lupin," Pomfrey said, eyeing the boys intensely. "I cannot bend the rules. I'm sorry, Mr. Lupin," she added which sent a breath of relief through his body that she had completely understood his expression."That's okay," he said, nodding. "I g-guess I'll see you later. Thanks, though."After the Marauders left, Pomfrey took Remus into her office so she could teach him simple spells. He had sort've learned some of them the previous year however wasn't too great. He practiced these a few times, tightening bandages around various parts of his body. She made sure he knew how to clean out his wounds (not that it mattered, since he wouldn't get infected anyway), explaining there'd be a jar in the bathroom full of potion to do so; there'd also be plenty of bandages.Pomfrey watched him as he tried to carefully tightened some gauze around his chest. "You shouldn't be doing this," she said."What am I d-doing wrong?""I meant be alone in the house," she said, undoing the gauze so he could try again. "I don't think it's safe.""Professor Dumbledore's made his decision," Remus said rather haughtily then regretted the tone in his voice. "I'll b-be okay. I... I appreciate your... concern. I really do." He wanted to add that the sooner he learned how to be completely alone the better. I'll have my parents, he thought as he managed to get the bandages to stay put without being too tight, But I shouldn't rely on them forever. I'm sure I'll be alone at some point in my life. I need to be able to take care of myself.She went over a few more helpful spells then sent him on his way, watching his small form trudge away from the hospital wing./\/\/\/\/\On Tuesday evening he left supper early to go and wait in the fourth floor room for Fawley (VERY glad James had Quidditch practice so they wouldn't try to stalk him this time around). He paced back and forth, going over the details, running his fingers through his hair, then whirling around when the door opened. Fawley came in then hesitated."Remus?""I'm—I'm already here, Miss Fawley.""Is everything all right?" She shut the door, going over to the couch.He sat down next to her, wringing his hands. "Um. Maybe. I—I'm not sure." He began pulling at his shirt sleeves, tugging them down. "I—I was wondering if I c-could talk to you about... about something.""Of course. You can talk to me about anything you want to."Remus looked down at his hands then pressed them up against his eyes. "When you see my memories, can—can you feel what I'm feeling?""No, my dear, it doesn't work like that.""Oh...""Why?"He let out a sigh. "I w—was hoping to show you, instead of saying it. Okay. Um. Well. You—you remember last year... I... had to stay in the hospital wing overnight because I... I got really distraught for... no apparent reason? Madame Pomfrey called it a—a panic attack, or anxiety attack?"Fawley nodded. "Yes, I remember that.""I've... I just—well, I wasn't sure if—if people get that?"She looked a little puzzled. "It would seem so. Why? Have you had another?"Remus withdrew a little, sitting on his shaking hands. "Not quite that bad. But, kinda. Sunday—well, Saturday night I had a nightmare and—and on Sunday I felt awful all day. I felt panicked, and scared, and—and my skin felt... felt... wrong. Like, itchy, and crawly. Like it wasn't my skin. Whenever I—I had to interact with people I wanted to scream. It was like their voices were just... pressing into me. I—I don't... I don't think it's normal, is it? Like, what people feel?"Fawley sat back, stroking her chin. "I'm afraid I don't really know much about this sort of thing. I think there are a lot of... mental issues that can happen, with varying degrees of... intensity. I think... that you... have gone through more than anyone should ever be expected to go through. I think due to your upbringing as well as being a werewolf it can be difficult for you to feel comfortable in everyday society. And... while your personal situation is rather unique, I do think what you're experiencing is something other people do experience."Remus looked slowly up into Fawley's face. "Mental issues. So... I'm... crazy?" Loopy. Loopy, Loopy Lupin!"What?" Fawley quickly shook her head. "No! You're not crazy. Mental issues do not equal crazy, Remus." She reached out until her hand touched his cheek gently. "That's really all you took from what I said? I think plenty of people do feel the same way you do. After all, if Madame Pomfrey told you what it seemed to be at the time it means that others have gone through it too, that she recognized the symptoms." She pulled her hand away, sighing. "You have a lot of anxiety for someone so young, though all things considering I suppose it isn't unusual. Perhaps... you should consider talking to someone.""I... I am, I'm—I'm talking to you!"Fawley chuckled. "I meant a professional."Remus blinked, cold creeping through his body; he felt slightly betrayed. "I—you—you just said I w-w-wasn't crazy.""You're not. There's nothing wrong with needing therapy. I needed it, after everything happened with me. It helped a lot. Through grieving my sister, my loss of sight, and coming to grips with the fact I married a total arse. It's... not something that wizarding society likes to think about. We can cure most physical ailments, it's not so easy to make a potion that can fix thoughts and feelings. Erase away the trauma one can concur. If you'd like I can perhaps try and find someone for you..."Remus bowed his head, a trifle angry with what Fawley was saying. A... a sensiwitch, someone who talked to people with mental problems to help them. Someone he probably needed... but could never have, as he could never tell them the complete story since he had to keep his lycanthropy a secret. He tried to imagine asking his mother if he could please see a mind healer and wanted to laugh. He knew precisely what would happen. She'd blame Hogwarts and take him out, keeping him at home. She'd insist he was fine. Now he had to scramble to cover his butt, to downplay everything he just said!"It's not th—that bad, Miss Fawley, it doesn't happen... a lot... I just... mostly w—was worried that this was... not..." He began twisting the hem of his shirt around his fingers, hoping she'd believe him, hoping the truth wouldn't be shown in his memories. "It—it made me feel..." Broken. "Even more not normal. If... if this is something that—that's not just because I'm a—a werewolf then... it's not so bad.""Remus—""Honest," he said firmly. "I'm okay. I am. I just didn't like feeling so different. I have enough of that, as what I am, so knowing that—that normal humans have similar things to this really helps out so much. Really. The reason I was so upset is because I was sc-scared this made me even more different, but knowing that—that it's not has made me feel a LOT better."Fawley remained silent, fingers curling around the top of her cane as she debated how to respond. "Very well. If you're sure...""I am," he promised, inching closer. "We—we can try my lesson now, please?"She went through his head, frowning after seeing the memory of Pomfrey helping him the night before, then smiling at the cookies. Remus was pleased about the smile since he knew she disapproved of his bond. Perhaps she'd know if I'm bonding unnaturally or not... except he didn't feel completely comfortable with that. He didn't want to risk purposely poking at his friendships with her.After Occlumency he went to the library until curfew, then returned to the dorms, mostly out of it until he was halfway across the common room. Then he stopped in his tracks, looking upwards. Half the furniture was on the ceiling. He blinked a few times then looked back down, twisting around to survey the rest of the room. Most the students looked put out. There were three prefects standing near the middle of the room, hands on their hips as they just stared upward. Remus cast another curious look at the furniture then, shrugging, headed to the stairs."Lupin!" He jumped about ten feet then whirled around in fear as one of the prefects began coming over. He was somewhat tall and a good bit muscular, which terrified Remus since he was barreling towards him. "Where are they?!" he demanded furiously."Wh—wh-who?"The prefect snorted. "The Wizengamot, who d'you think? Your bloody friends!""Um. Wh... why?" he asked, already knowing the answer.The prefect jabbed his finger towards the ceiling. "They did this!"Remus looked once more at the furniture, realizing they weren't floating. They were literally on the ceiling. Sticking spell? he wondered, figuring Sirius had done it. Arrrgh, he was too drained to deal with this right now. Why couldn't they have one night without causing trouble?! "Can't you get them—them down?""We've tried! Whatever they did, we can't undo! Go get them. Now!"Remus swallowed, stepping back. "If you c-c-can't do it, what makes you think—""NOW, LUPIN!"Remus squeaked and fled up the stairs. Spinnet and Struthers were in the dorm, neither having seen the other Marauders since supper. Remus figured that the prefects had already checked the dorm. Bathroom? He put his stuff on his bed then went across the hall, pushing the door open to the very dark room. He glanced around then started to leave except he heard hushed voices. He tiptoed in, following the sound over to one of the shower stalls. There was a very faint light emitting from inside. He could hear his friends on the other side of the curtains and the gentle slap of cards.Remus pushed open the curtains causing the three of them to shriek in fear."Merlin's beard, Remy, you gave us a heart attack!" Sirius wheezed out, clutching his chest.Remus stepped in, shutting the curtains behind him before sinking down cross-legged between Pete and James, careful not to mess up the pile of cards or James's lit up wand. "Why's half the common room furniture on the ceiling?"They all exchanged looks then James scooped up his hand of cards again. "Whoops," was all he said."Whoops?"Pete began giggling. "It was an accident."Remus rubbed his forehead. He had a bit of a headache from Occlumency and now it grew worse. "How do you accidentally put half the common room furniture onto the ceiling to the point where a seventh year cannot get them down?""Talent!" Sirius exclaimed, jabbing the air with his forefinger. Remus glared at him. "And sticking spells. Might've accidentally done the permanent sticking spell, I can't really remember.""And the fact they're on the ceiling?"James shrugged. "I just don't understand why everyone's upset. We're supposed to be practicing the levitation spell! Flitwick said! So, we tried to see how well we can do it. Which is pretty darn good, getting some of the lighter chairs and stuff." Remus realized then that the furniture on the ceiling had been the smaller bits of furniture, none of the bigger chairs, couches, or tables."Plus it—it's not half," Sirius said, leaning closer to Remus. "I'd say only a mere..." He squinted, still staring at Remus. "Mmm, third."Remus narrowed his eyes right back. "And the reason they had the sticking spell on them?"Sirius's lips twisted into a smile as he sat back, shrugging. "Whoops."Remus just groaned and dropped his head in his hand. "Well, the prefects are looking for you.""Um, yeah," Peter said, rolling his eyes. "Why d'you think we're in here?""We're trying to wait them out, so we can deal with McGonagall directly over this," James added. "I think we can talk our way out of big trouble if it's her."Remus was about to say something back then heard voices out in the hall. Prefects. They were across the hall at the dorm, demanding James and Sirius. He heard something about the bathroom then jumped to his feet, quickly turning the water on. All his friends yelped as warm water sprayed down on them. "Shhhh!" Remus hissed just as the door to the bathroom flung open."Potter!" the prefect shouted as lights flickered on, "Black! I know you're in there! Come on then, who's in the shower?"Remus put a finger to his lips then turned around. "Um, it's—it's me. Lupin.""What are you doing in the shower?"Remus crept forward, pushing past the inner curtain then cautiously poking his wet head out the outer, holding the curtain to cover his clothes as if he were naked. "Would you b-believe getting a shower?"The prefect narrowed his eyes. "In the dark?"Remus bit his bottom lip. "I like the—the dark. I've got my wand lit up anyway.""Are Potter and Black in there?" He tried to look past Remus.His eyes went huge. "P-perhaps you're in the—the habit of showering with your friends, b-but I am not."The prefect went deep red, fury flashing across his face. He jerked just slightly as if he might just come into the shower then held back. "Watch it, Loopy. When you see them, let them know they're in trouble." With that he left, slamming the door shut behind him.Remus stumbled back into the shower, slumping against the wall. His friends were all grinning. "Excellent job, Mr. Lupin!" Sirius said, offering his hand.He smiled faintly, shaking Sirius's hand while James turned the water off and Peter picked up his soggy, ruined cards, a look of dismay. "I'll buy you a new deck," James promised with a giggle. "That was great.""You know you've only just postponed the inevitable," Remus pointed out as they all began squeezing water out of their soaked uniforms. Sirius tipped his head so he could wring out his hair."Oh, without doubt," laughed James. "But I'd rather deal with McGonsie than a prefect over this sort of thing."Remus sighed, shaking his head with a smile at what just happened. It would be a wonder if James managed to remain on the Quidditch team by the end of the year!/\/\/\/\/\Professor McGonagall waited for the Marauders outside the Great Hall when morning came. She inquired after the furniture (which had still been on the ceiling when they headed out for the day), wanting to know precisely what happened. Since most the common room had witnessed them doing this they certainly couldn't deny their involvement. So James and Sirius put on their best puppy dog eyes, pleading that they were merely practicing for Charms class and they hadn't meant for all that to happen and really, Professor, who could punish students for doing their homework? Something about their countenance got to her and she let them off with a warning and a small lecture."And that, dear boy, is why we go to McGonsie and not the prefects," Sirius said, slinging an arm across Remus's shoulders. "All you gotta do is cry homework." Remus rolled his eyes, trying not to smile."So, was thinking, lunchtime—we have got to try to get to the girls' dorm," James muttered under his breath as they went in to find seats.Remus hesitated before sitting down. "How many points have we lost Gryffindor so far?""Who cares about points anyway?" Sirius asked. "Like, what are they even for? It's like grades, it doesn't mean anything."It felt like an electric shock to his system, or what he imagined one would feel like. It took a few seconds of his mouth moving for the sounds to actually get out. "Grades—grades m-mean—that's not—what—no—no, um—what? No! Th—that's not...!"James and Peter bust up laughing. "I think you just sent Remy into a fit," Pete giggled.Remus was well aware his face had gone brilliantly red. "N-n-not a fit! Grades aren't—grades—you—that isn't—""Relax!" Sirius pat his back. "I didn't mean it like that." Remus waited for him to explain what he did mean however he didn't say, instead complaining about the prefects sticking their noses into innocent students' businesses, ignoring the fact they were not in any way, shape, or form innocent.

After Charms instead of going to the Great Hall the Marauders went up to the tower, to try out their big plan. Their test. Which Remus still felt weird about it being his idea, technically (though Sirius kept saying how proud he was for Remus to think it up). There were a few people in the common room (the furniture still on the ceiling) but luckily they didn't need the entire tower empty. They headed up to their dorm where James got out his broom, carefully mounting it before Sirius arranged the cloak over him."Open the window!" he exclaimed.Peter ran over, throwing the window open. They heard James going over then leaving. All three of them crowded together, leaning out to try to see even though there was nothing to see; then Remus glanced down, feeling ill. Quickly he pulled back in."You think he'll manage?" Pete asked."Probably, I doubt they've enchanted the windows," replied Sirius, leaning out even farther. Remus got out some snacks from his desk which drew Pete away from the window. They sat on his bed, sharing the food, while Sirius just kept leaning out the window. "I hope he's all right," he said after a few minutes. "I think we'd've heard something by now if there was an alarm on the windows too, right?" He stayed still, watching. A few more minutes passed. "Come on, Jimmy.""Standing vigilant won't do anything," Remus pointed out."I don't know what that word means so I'm not gonna answer," Sirius said, eyes still locked on the sky. Remus rolled his eyes.Remus and Peter finished off the apples and most the crisps, wiping their hands off then joining Sirius back at the window. Another moment or so passed until they heard James's voice telling them to please move.They backed away as James came flying in, nearly crashing. "I did it!" he laughed, ripping his cloak off. "I got in a dorm! I'm not sure which one. I think the third years? But it works! Lads, it works! We can sneak into the girls' dorms! We got past all their barriers! We'll be able to play pranks on them and NOBODY will ever suspect it's us! Hah!" He carefully put his broom back in its case then, with a flourish, whipped out a bra from his pocket. "Ta-da!""Yes!" Sirius shouted while Peter clapped his hands and Remus snorted.This bra was vastly different from Professor Dedenne's bra, the only other one they had to compare it to. This one was much smaller and didn't quite hold the—the cup shape that Dedenne's had. Wasn't so stiff. It was white with delicate pink flowers though it did have tiny white sort of scallop-y shapes around the top of the boob area."This one's so floppy!" Pete said, taking the bra and waving it. "It's not that shiny, either. It's just like... plain cloth.""Yeah, it's really boring," Sirius said. "Just like a pair of underwear. Not interesting."James grunted. "Next time you can steal fancier ones. I didn't want to take a really fancy one cause I don't think we'll be able to return it anytime soon. That one looked like it wasn't as pricey so that's why I chose that. But guys—guys! The underwear drawer was like..." His eyes got enormous as he spread his hands out. "So many colors! And they all felt so different too!""Didja look at the panties?" Sirius asked with a grin, taking the bra from Peter and holding it up to his own chest.James snickered. "I did. A little bit. I didn't want to stay too long. Next time you can come with me. Though I doubt we can fit all of us on a broom...""That's fine, I don't particularly want to go stealing girls' underwear," Remus put in quickly, trying his best to pretend he didn't notice the looks they all gave him. Like they thought he was crazy. "I—I don't think we should be stealing underwear at all. It's not—not nice to steal clothes of any kind!" He thought for a quick second then shrugged. "Unless it is Slytherin clothing.""EW SLYTHERIN PANTIES!" Peter squealed which sent them all into loud gags."It smelled so different from our dorm." James went to flop onto Remus's bed, hand snaking into a bag of crisps. "Like, flowery? There was makeup all over the dressers too. Some of them. There were lots of magazines everywhere like our dorm but most of them were girly magazines. Posters and pictures of boys on the walls. There was also a spell stuck up next to one of the mirrors.""What spell?" Remus asked.Sirius snorted. "Oh yeah, that's what gets your attention. Not the panties, but the spell."Remus stuck his tongue out at him, quite annoyed, slight embarrassed. Maybe he should pretend to be interested in the bra? He took it very carefully between a thumb and forefinger, holding it up to look at the bizarre article of clothing. He wondered briefly who it belonged to then quickly dropped it realizing it'd had boobs in them. Uggggh. "What spell?" he asked again, wiping his hand off.James squinted, trying to remember. "C-i-r-r-a-t-i-u-m.""Cirratium..." Remus frowned, rubbing his chin. "Not quite sure of the etymology. It sounds like Latin..." He tried to work out what it could possibly mean, a few theories floating around his mind."What's it do?" Pete asked."One way to find out..." James whipped out his wand, pointing it at Peter who yelped, trying to dive out of the way. "Come on then, Petey, can't be too bad if some girls are using it! Cirratium! Sit still! Cirratium—Cirratium!" This last one hit Pete whose hair immediately poofed out in extreme curls.Nobody spoke for a second then Sirius and James laughed very hard. "Ah!" Remus said with a smile. "Cirratus. Curly." Then he joined in with the laughing, clutching his stomach, wiping tears away."Explains why it was stuck on a mirror," Sirius said once he could talk again."Make it go BACK!" Peter yelled, clutching at his wild curls."I—I don't know how!" James said, trying to sound apologetic but his huge grin betrayed him. "Ask Remy, not me!""I haven't the faintest either!" Remus protested.Pete lurched forward, grabbing Remus's collar as Remus squeaked with a little bit of fear at the intensity flashing in Peter's eyes. "Make. it. Go. BACK! I—I can't go to class like this! I look—I look horrible! I look like a—a poodle!""Oh, just wear your hat," snickered Sirius, joining James on Remus's bed to eat the crisps."Nobody wears the hats except for special occasions! I'll be laughed at just as much!" Peter looked a little teary-eyed as he stared in horror at his reflection. "Please—Remus... please!""I—I'll try," Remus said. "Finite incantatum!" he tried with no success. "Um.""Um?" Peter glared at Remus. "What do you mean um?"Remus threw his hands up. "I'm sorry! I don't know how to even begin to fix this if the general counter-curse doesn't work!""W—well what's Latin for straight?!"Remus sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "It doesn't work that way."Peter began trying to flatten down his hair but it kept springing back up. "I hate you, James Potter!""It's not that bad," James said with a snicker. Then he burst into laughter. "Nah, I lied, it is!"Remus genuinely felt bad for Peter, remembering how he felt with a horrifyingly embarrassing hairstyle. So he flicked his wand towards James. "Cirratium."James's hair now sproinged out, his curls a lot tighter and going in every direction. "Wh—REMUS?!" James scrambled off the bed, dashing to the mirror. "Why the erkling did you do THAT?!"The other two were laughing again, Sirius gasping for air, while tears poured down Peter's cheeks."I did it because of the flippancy you have towards Pete's predicament," Remus sniffled then screamed, diving under his bed as James tried to hit him with the spell. "No! NO!" He wriggled his way under then did his best to put up a shield to protect him. The spell bounced off."Take your medicine, Lupin!" James yelled."Go away!"Sirius fell off the bed from laughing so hard, pounding his fists against the floor. James crouched, glowering at Remus. "Come on out," he sang, wriggling his finger."Go away!" Sirius's hand wrapped around his wrist. "Sirius—no—no!" Remus yelped as the traitor began pulling him out from under his bed. He made a grab for the edge, holding on tight. "NO! If you do this so help me—YAHHH!"Sirius gave a mighty tug and Remus rolled out, being hit with the spell immediately. "No!" He reached up, feeling that his own curls were more like Peter's than James's. They didn't feel too wild. "Why?!""All's fair," James said. Remus narrowed his eyes and pointed his wand. "You already got me with it, dummy, whatcha gonna do?""Cirratium!" Remus said, flicking his wand towards Sirius who shrieked. "That's what you get, traitor!" Then he scowled because Sirius's curls were very soft and looked... well, quite nice on him. But he still shouted about his 'poor hair' and 'how dare you!'. He stood in front of the mirror, lower lip sticking out.Pete, watching all this from his bed, was grinning. "I don't feel so bad now. Thanks, guys!"Remus peered into the mirror, running his fingers through his hair, trying to pull the curls out. "If we go out like this then the third year girls realize a bra is missing they might put two and two together.""Nah, it's a reach," replied James. He took the end of one of his tight curls then pulled it out. When he let go it sprang back into place. "Don't want to go to class looking like this though.""Everyone's gonna laugh at us," Pete agreed solemnly."We have History in less than half an hour," Remus pointed out."Definitely not going," Sirius said, bending in to study his reflection closer. "Let's go to Pomfrey, maybe she can reverse it or summon the hair witch that cuts our hair. Don't wanna go through the halls though." Peter picked up his robes, sliding his arms through then pulling the hood over to hide his hair. Sirius grinned. "Brilliant."They all got their robes on, hiding their shame under the hoods. In addition they took side passages as well as secret ways to get to the hospital wing so they'd be less likely seen; actually, not seen at all, thank Merlin. The four of them trudged into the hospital wing, having to wait until Pomfrey returned from lunch. Remus fidgeted, hoping they'd be able to get to History even if they were a little bit late.Pomfrey looked more resolved than surprised to see the four of them sitting there. "What happened this time?"None of them said anything until finally James stood up. "Erm, we sort've had an accident.""All of you?""Uh... yeah, um, all of us..."Pomfrey looked him up and down. "Are you going to tell me or do I have to guess?" James glanced back at the other three then pulled his hood down. Remus tugged his back, then Peter, then finally Sirius. Pomfrey's lip twitched slightly. "A hair accident," she said slowly. "Can you tell me exactly what happened?""Slytherins," Sirius said immediately.Pomfrey raised her eyebrows. "I see. Slytherins attacked you and... curled your hair." They remained silent. "My guess is you found a spell somewhere or heard it, didn't know what it did, and decided to test it out.""Um, it... might have gone more like that," James admitted then put on his best Potter smile. "Can you please help us?""This is a hospital wing! I'm here for medical issues, not..." Her eyes focused on the top of his head. "... styling trouble."Now Sirius jumped up. "Please! Ma'am, come on, look at us, we look awful!""Again, that is not my problem," she sniffled. "Get to class. You're already late.""It is a medical problem though!" Sirius continued. "It's causing me great distress and anguish!" He clutched at his chest, right over his heart. "Stress isn't very good on the ol' ticker, now, is it?""I highly doubt having curly hair for a few hours is going to give you a heart attack.""You know I've always thought you were the most talented and amazing witch," Sirius went on, smiling very sweetly. "You're so pretty too.""Out, Mr. Black."They yanked their hoods back up, exiting out of the wing with grumbles. There wasn't any question about whether or not to go to class, none of them dared. Not even Sirius who looked perfectly fine with his curls. Remus wasn't amused by that, as it seemed like there was very little to make Sirius look less than amazing. Remus thought he could roll down a long, steep hill through mud and he'd still probably just be beautifully tousled, as handsome as ever. It really wasn't fair at all."Let's go to Remus's place," James suggested."My what?!" he half-shrieked, suddenly terrified they knew—somehow—about the house in Hogsmeade.James grinned. "The library, silly. We'll find an answer there. With your research skills and my—whatever it is I have, we'll get the answer in no time, eh?"It wasn't very far to the library normally however as they wanted to avoid the main passage it took a bit longer. Finally they crept in, ignoring the librarian glowering at them. Mr. Farrow wasn't a very pleasant man normally but he held special disdain towards James and Sirius. He didn't complain, just sneered as they headed through the aisles. Remus went directly to the Charms area, vaguely remembering some shelves dedicated to appearance-based spells. The other three didn't help much as he searched through multiple books until he found out that had the curling spell and its opposite, the straightening spell."But my hair isn't straight normally," Sirius pointed out. "We need a spell to just cancel it."Remus took the book to a table to more carefully sift through, shaking his head. "Not finding much in here.""I say we straighten our hair, then let the spell just wear off Sirius," suggested Peter."No I want my wavy hair!" Sirius growled. "Not straight! Not curly! Wavy! It's my hair! It's my look! Remus, this is your fault.""You're the one who pulled me out from under my bed," Remus replied without looking up from the book. "You just have to deal with the consequences. I don't think these spells last long, in any case. After all the spell was tacked up next to the mirror, right?" he questioned James who nodded. "Therefore, logically thinking, they must need to use it often.""If they used it often though won't they just remember the spell?" Pete asked, tugging his hood down lower. "I mean, I don't remember many spells but I do know the ones we use a lot."James reached out, fingers brushing against the book. "At least let us straighten our hair. I mean, my hair's not like, completely straight either but I'd rather it not look like this.""S'not as wavy as mine," Sirius grumbled however didn't protest any more so they left the library once Remus checked out the book, and found a hidden passageway to test out the spell. Remus tried a couple times until he managed to fix Peter's hair, for once willing to be the first test subject. He fixed James's hair, then his own, then looked at Sirius who let out a loud groan, covering his face with his hands while agreeing miserably."What's the big deal?" James asked as Sirius's hair was straightened. It looked just as nice completely straight as it did wavy or curly."My hair... is important to me," Sirius mumbled, tugging at one of the strands."It looks nice either way," Remus said with a smile, trying to cheer him up. Sirius sank down lower,cheeks going a little pink, tugging at his hair more, staring intently at the strands. He didn't say anything so Remus figured he had said the wrong thing, and felt a little bad. "Well, um, looks like we pretty much missed all of History so we'll be getting into trouble for that."They hung out in the passage until History was over then headed to Transfiguration where McGonagall was waiting for them with her lips pressed thin. "I admit, I am rather surprised to find you here," she said as they slunk over to their seats."Why is that, Professor?" James asked sweetly."I've been told you skipped History. Again."Sirius tossed his hair back. Despite the spells being used on it, it still moved beautifully. "We had an emergency. You can ask Madame Pomfrey, we went to the hospital wing.""Oh, I'll be sure to inquire later today," McGonagall said stonily, "but for now five points each from Gryffindor."Remus tried not to feel too depressed over another twenty points lost. They were in last place as it was, which was pretty much solely thanks to the Marauders. Most the other second years scowled at them throughout class then afterwards Lily asked what the emergency was. Remus didn't really want to say so he said it was a personal matter."Remus, were you lot just bunking off again?" she asked, eyes narrowed."No, we—we really had some... issues," he said, rubbing his elbow. "Perhaps not an emergency but... well, we—we found a spell and tried it out It had... embarrassing results.""Is that why you were missing from lunch?" Her eyes danced with amusement. "What happened?"Remus made a huffy sound. "I'm not telling! It was really embarrassing." Though actually he hadn't really minded his curls too much, they hadn't looked terrible really. Definitely not as bad as that stupid Christopher Robin haircut! Between that or the curls, he'd choose the curls in a heartbeat. "We tried to get Pomfrey to help us however she decided it wasn't an emergency, so we had to help ourselves."A hand came down on his shoulder causing him to jump. "You're not telling her what happened, are you?" James demanded rather furiously. Beyond him Sirius and Pete were looking betrayed and angry."No, he won't, he's keeping whatever secret it is that's upset you so much," Lily informed him haughtily before walking quickly off.James put his thumb on his nose and wriggled his fingers at her before pulling Remus back to the Marauders, all of them making it clear they hadn't really thought he'd tell Lily, but one did have to be careful.It seemed McGonagall was satisfied enough with the fact they had gone to the hospital wing because she didn't seek them out, and by morning Sirius's hair had returned to its regular waves. Remus had no clue what the others had done with the bra nor did he care.Spinnet, on the other hand, wound up having to go to classes the next day with extremely curly hair and complained that he had no idea how it happened he just woke up that way. Professor Prewett fixed it in Defense, though Spinnet still sulked the remainder of the day.That evening at James's practice it was quite difficult for Remus to concentrate on his book or the flying. He sat in the bleachers with Sirius and Peter, a book propped in front of him, but he felt a little too tired to even attempt to read. The next night would be the moon and he was starting to get a little frightened at the prospect of being alone. It's what he wanted all last year—not to have to drag himself to the hospital wing every morning only to go back every evening, especially in the winter when there wasn't as much daylight. It was rough. However... he had never been alone before like that. He'd been alone plenty on nights that he didn't transform, but not after transformations. He always had his parents or Pomfrey to take care of him.I have to get used to taking care of myself, he thought for the millionth time. But it was still rather scary.He gave up trying to read and just propped his elbows on his knees, his chin in his hands as he watched James flying around. On top of feeling afraid of being alone he was still unsure whether they'd be... showing up or not. None of them had mentioned wanting to come hear the haunted house during the full moon ever since James first mentioned it, so he figured he was safe. He hoped.

In the morning it took Remus ages to get out of bed. He felt bone-tired, and his mind was very foggy as he struggled to get dressed. He thought he did decently but as he tried to leave Sirius stopped him to point out he was wearing his pajama pants. Remus disappeared behind his curtains to change those out then shuffled along to the Great Hall.To his sleepy delight his parents sent an owl which gave him the perfect opportunity to lie as he wanted to use his mother as an excuse. He opened up the letter, pretended to read a bit, then folded it up, tucking it away. "Looks like it didn't work," he said."What didn't?" James asked."The, um, potion Mum and I took to hopefully help us," Remus explained carefully as he stirred his porridge. "Mum's gotten sick again, it's pretty bad. I—I think I might go after classes."Sirius and James looked at each other in the sort of manner that meant something. Remus stiffened, clutching his spoon as he tried to figure out what was going on. Then there was a soft sort of sound from under the table and James very slightly, briefly flinched. Had Sirius kicked him? "I'm sorry to hear that," James finally said."What happened?" Peter asked. "Did the medicine make it worse?""I don't th—think so," Remus said, unnerved by James and Sirius, anxious about those expressions. What did they mean?"Are you getting sick too?" Sirius inquired."M... me? No. Why?""You don't look too well." Sirius's eyes scanned him up and down then settled on his face again. "You look pretty awful, no offense."Remus ducked his head, poking at the glop of food in his bowl. "I'm fine," he said uncomfortably. So that's what was with those looks, they thought he was going into a relapse."Yeah, you look super sick," Peter said, peering into Remus's face."You look like you should go to a healer too," agreed James."Are you sure—" Sirius started however Remus interrupted with a rather explosive, "I'm fine!" They all recoiled at Remus's tone who immediately regretted how he had spoken. "S—sorry, I'm just... really worried about my mum."They all mumbled incoherently back then returned to their breakfasts. Remus poked at his, wondering if the reason Sirius was so overbearing about all this was because of that comment he made not long ago, about whether or not Remus's illness was fatal. He glanced surreptitiously towards his friend then back down. At least he knew Sirius didn't think that he was a werewolf; he had gone through a terrifying, horrifying, sickening period near the end of their first year when he thought Sirius suspected however Sirius told Remus he thought Remus was a good person. That plus the fact Sirius willingly did things like poke Remus or put an arm around him sorta proved he didn't suspect at all, because what twelve year old pureblood would ever do such things towards a monster?Still... it seemed like Sirius's determination to pry into his illness had been going up since their second year started... he hoped Sirius wouldn't be like this all year...Mondays and Fridays were the roughest days class-wise, so this Friday coupled with the moon coming up did not bode well. Starting with Potions didn't bode well either. He collapsed into his seat, feeling nauseated by the smells of the ingredients sitting out. Slughorn began pacing back and forth, patting his oversized stomach as he explained the potion they'd be working on. Remus sort of tuned in and out, fighting off the urge to constantly yawn. They were partnered up, allowed to choose their own partners. As usual, Remus ended up with Sirius who goofed off while Remus sleepily read out the instructions. He grew grouchy over the fact Sirius wasn't... well, being serious about this. He needed better grades. Just because Sirius didn't care..."Could you please pay attention?" he finally asked."I am!" Sirius promised, cocking his head to one side. "Sorta."Remus was too tired to argue and unsurprised when they received a P. They had Charms next which Remus struggled through, then he slept during lunch. He tried hard to stay wake but his entire body sang with absolute exhaustion."You sure—like, sure-sure—you're not getting sick again?" Peter asked when he woke up when the bell rang.He shook his head. "Fine. I mean, no—I mean, yeah I'm sure. Just tired. And worried. About my mother."They had a free period before History which was spent outside. Remus fell asleep again which meant he was able to somehow get through History then Transfiguration. Professor McGonagall certainly noticed Remus having difficulty performing his spells however also knew why, so she didn't draw attention to it.After class his friends began begging him to go to the hospital wing. Remus kept assuring them he felt fine, temper slowly growing until he snapped. "I am FINE!" he yelled, hitching his satchel up higher on his shoulder. "Stop telling me how I must feel because I know how I feel, and I am not SICK!"James snapped right back with, "You look ready to collapse at any second!""I don't give a flying jarvey how I look, I know how I feel and it isn't sick!" He shot glares at all three of them."So... are we not supposed to be concerned about you?" Peter asked, voice climbing a little with distress.Remus clenched his teeth. "I... appreciate the concern. I really do. It's just frustrating being told how other people think I'm doing, especially when I've clearly communicated I feel perfectly fine." Sirius grabbed his arm, hauling him off. Remus gave a squawk of protest, then struggled to get free to no avail. Sirius just kept pulling him into a bathroom and in front of a mirror. He flinched at his own reflection. He did look ready to just keel over. He looked really bad. "Again, I don't care how I look. I'm fine. Why can't you just listen to me?"James folded his arms. "Well, excuse me for being worried!""Why can't you just believe me?!" James jabbed his finger towards the mirror. Remus let out a sound of disgust. "Merlin. I am fine, I do not feel sick at all. My mum is sick, not me.""You can be sick at the same time your mum is," Sirius pointed out."I—I'm not saying I can't be! I'm only saying—just—please, can we drop it?" He searched their faces, a sinking feeling that they wouldn't.Sure enough... "Could you at least go see Pomfrey before you leave?" James asked, pushing his hair back. "Please?"Remus scowled, anger building up, the wolf starting to pace, wanting to come out, wanting to lash out. "Why? To ease your minds since you don't believe me? No. I'm not sick."James suddenly put a hand against Remus's forehead. "You might have a fever—"Remus pushed his hand away, backing up, a little shocked at the sudden touch, a lot shocked at how insistent they were being. It was really grating against him and beginning to make him a bit panicked. "Just DROP IT!" He wished he had stated he was ill but now he couldn't go back. It was more of the fact they were infuriating him with their nosiness. He was sick with them trying to pressure him over all of this. It made him really edgy. "Please," he added."Right," James said a bit stiffly. "I'll just not be at all alarmed over the fact you look like you're so sick. It's not my business, is it?""James—""Not like friends aren't suppose to care about each other," he continued, ignoring Remus. "I mean, if I looked as bad off as you do—""You don't, though!" Remus cut him off now with a cry. James closed his mouth, eyes widening. "Okay? None of you know what I'm going through!" He felt his nose itch as he tried to find footing in the dark. Perhaps he should have just gone to Pomfrey, acquiesced to their demands, but their prying into his secrets had really set him off. "You just don't get it! I'm glad you care about me enough to worry but you need to bloody take into account what I am SAYING!" The worst part was how right they were, how horrible he felt, how physically dreadful, how much he just wanted to sleep until sundown. "My illness is my business. Not yours. Any of yours," he added, shooting a look towards Sirius who looked vaguely guilty. "I don't care if I look like I'm on death's door, about to drop dead... it's my affair!" His voice began shaking, threatening to break as he fought back tears.James let out a sort of huffy, surprised sound then just stared stonily at him, trembling very slightly. He finally turned and left the bathroom without another word, slamming the door shut so hard it rattled the mirrors.Nobody spoke for several seconds then Peter edged towards the door. "Um," he said in a nervous, fluttery sort of voice. "I—I think... he's just... I mean... he—he did just... lose his grandfather... Um, I mean, I think that's why he might be so worried... well, um, sorry—sorry." Then he scurried out after James.Remus slumped back, having completely forgotten about James's grandfather. And he went and said that about death and... "Merlin," he moaned, putting his head in his hands. He completely screwed things up. How much more insensitive could he have been?! James's worries were annoying, but... seeing his grandfather... then... "You can go too," he mumbled, muffled from the palms of his hand covering his mouth.Sirius shifted his weight so he stood closer to Remus. "I'm in both sides of the camp here, Remy. I'm worried about you but I do think he was pushing you too much." Then after a second, "I know I've pushed you in the past too. Didn't really realize how crappy it was of me until I saw someone else do it.""I'm just going to go home to see my mother," Remus said softly, still covering his face, wishing Sirius would go so he could be alone. Sirius didn't budge. "You should... see if James is all right...""Yeah. All right. Be careful—er, I'll see you... in a couple days."Sirius left the bathroom and when the door clicked shut behind him Remus dropped to his knees, wrapping his arms around his middle as he bent forward, tears dripping down. He felt so stupid. He shouldn't have said... of course, James had said things about dying since then but—well, that was probably different. Making jokes was one thing, coming from someone who looked as sick as Remus was another thing entirely. He knew he needed to apologize however didn't think he had to strength to go after James right now. Plus he'd probably just mess it up even more, with as thick as he was at being a human.He staggered to his feet, wiping his face off on his sleeve before miserably heading to the hospital wing./\/\/\/\/\Pomfrey took him all the way to the house this time, stomping along the tunnel. She didn't say much but radiated disapproval until they finally climbed up into the battered living room. She repeated everything McGonagall had already told him: that if he didn't send a message within an hour after sunrise she'd come and get him, he needed to leave a message before sundown, etc, etc. She also mentioned that the fridge would be well stocked, and they had all the linen and towels cleaned a few days ago. She gave a loud sniff as if to further show how much she disliked this, then pat his shoulder wishing him luck.After she left Remus sunk down onto the couch. He was too depressed over what happened with James to do much of anything except hug a pillow and stare at the empty fireplace. He kept hearing himself saying it didn't matter if he dropped dead, then James's voice repeating some of the stuff he said in his letter over the summer, about his nightmares, about being buried with his grandfather. Part of why he had completely forgotten was James barely spoke about what happened over the summer. He acted perfectly fine. But Remus of all people should know the facade others put on to hide what was going on underneath. It could very well be James had been privately anguishing over the death of his grandfather all this time. Then Remus looks sick, James gets worried, and Remus said that about it not mattering if he looked about to die.He rolled over, clinging tighter to the pillow. He didn't completely regret standing up for himself, because it wasn't their business at all. He didn't want them knowing much, asking questions, trying to slide themselves into what went on in the hospital wing. It'd be far too dangerous. He needed to keep them at a distance in that respect. Should keep them at a distance period, he thought. Maybe I should never told them I was sick.He sat up now, rubbing his eyes. No. He knew he wouldn't be able to get away with that. Not with the way he tended to look around the full moon, it was quite obvious there was something chronic going on with him. I have to give it a name, he decided. That could get them off his back. He'd need to do research into Muggle blood diseases that passed on genetically that fit the symptoms he had. He'd need to find Muggle medical books. How? Fawley? Would Fawley be able to help him? He didn't want to rely on her too much, she had already done so much for him. Would Pomfrey know? Surely she had to have some Muggle medical books, in case of Muggleborns having Muggle diseases. Though he supposed it could be magical too. After all, even though his mum was Muggle nobody could know for sure her entire ancestral history, she could very well have had a magical ancestor.I'll look into magical diseases first. The library would have plenty of medical books, right?Although there was always the chance he couldn't find anything exactly right... or that giving more lies could turn on him. He was already lying so much, should he do more? Should he keep on like this, or build up more falsehoods? He regretted every mentioning the stupid cure thing but—it was all just so frustrating, and confusing! He wished things could be easier../\/\/\/\/\Remus cried out in pain as his body twisted, the fur disappearing, his bones shrinking, his form going from giant wolf to small boy. He lay on the ground, panting softly for air as the initial pain of transforming back subsided and he could take note of what continued to hurt. His chest. His right leg. His shoulder, a little bit.He closed his eyes, reaching out for some kind of cloth to cover himself, resting a little bit before he went to get cleaned up before Pomfrey got there. He was about to drift back into sleep when he remembered Pomfrey wasn't coming! He opened his eyes, sitting up then hissing in pain. I need to get to the bathroom! He looked down at his body. There were some deep scratches on his chest, awful teeth marks in his right thigh, and a gouge out of his right calf. He couldn't really see anything wrong with his shoulder but it kinda burned so maybe it was torn on the inside. He shifted, testing out how much his leg hurt before getting up. He nearly fell then forced himself into the bathroom, leaving a trail of blood.He washed his hands then picked up the piece of chalk, about to write a message then he hesitated. I need to be honest, he thought. If he ever lied about his state of well being and they found out they'd probably never let him be alone. So he sat down on the toilet to again assess his body. The scratches and shoulder would be fine. The gouge in the leg was nasty but he thought it'd be manageable. The rest of the scratches were definitely nothing to be too concerned about. The bite mark, however, was pretty deep and bleeding pretty bad, and in his thigh. He tried to remember where the arteries were that could be dangerous if they were sliced into. He thought they were on the inner thigh, so the bite on the outside should be okay... right?He got back up and wrote on the chalkboard.I'm feeling okay. Bite on my thigh but it is outside of thigh so should be okay? Is that where the main artery is?He stood back, waiting with a pounding heart. It took a moment but then Pomfrey's handwriting appeared. Femoral artery is on inner thigh. How deep is the bite mark?Remus replied it wasn't that deep, and that it was his worst wound. He promised he'd be fine, and thanked her, then got into the shower. It hurt a lot to clean himself off then he staggered out, pulling bandages out of the medicine cabinet. He wrapped them around his lower and upper leg, then plastered bandages on his chest, wrapping gauze around to keep them in place without a spell. They didn't look the best, but they'd do.He limped upstairs, pulling himself along the handrail, whimpering every time he put weight on his right leg. Finally he reached the bedroom then stared in horror. The wardrobe was mostly intact but he had tried to break into it sometime during the night. There were splintered bits on the floor, and a very tiny, narrow, vertical hole in one door. He knew the previous year he had tried to get into the wardrobe before but it had never been this bad.Will it hold up till Monday? he wondered, unlocking the door so he could get to his clothes. He had at least remembered to bring gentle clothes with him. Baggy sweatpants and an enormous t-shirt that swallowed him. He decided not to bother with the underwear, not wanting to try to get them over his leg wounds. Then he pulled on socks, crawled into the bed, and fell asleep./\/\/\/\/\Remus woke up sometime in the afternoon, not sure what time it was. He made his way downstairs, going to the bathroom real quick before scrounging around in the fridge. He didn't have the energy to do much, just slap together a sandwich. He missed the chocolate shakes Pomfrey had been making for him towards the end of his first year. Would it be too awful to ask if the house-elves could supply a few in the fridge?Now what? Normally he slept most the day but he felt far too aware of his surroundings to do so. He tried reading, but every little noise made him jump. It made him feel smaller... being in the house during the day—despite the fact no daylight penetrated into the house—was a little scary. Just the knowledge that it was day outside, that people were going about their business in Hogsmeade...He got up, going over to the front door. Maybe someone's out there now, he thought with a shiver. James and Sirius had sorta described the area. There was a hill, and a fence. Someone could be at that fence right now staring at the house. He backed away from the door, rubbing his arms, uncomfortable. He paced around for a while then got out cleaning supplies to try and get rid of some of the blood. Except kneeling on the floor hurt his leg too much so he quickly gave up on that idea, opting to try and read again until he snapped the book shut, put everything away, ate another sandwich, then went to bed once more, hoping that he'd soon feel more comfortable./\/\/\/\/\He woke up to a very faint thudding sound. What in Merlin's name!?Another thud.He scrambled out of bed, breathing heavily, absolutely beyond terrified. Something was going on. Something had... knocked against the side of the house? He tiptoed downstairs, nearly falling as the thudding happened again. It was coming from the living room, against one of the windows. Remus went over, legs trembling. Thud. He jerked back, nearly vomiting as he realized it was the sound of someone trying to get in, trying to knock through the slats. Not that they could get through. Could they? He could hear muffled voices, but the intense spells on the house was making it hard for even his hearing to penetrate the walls. At least on its own...Remus hurried to the kitchen to grab a glass then went back out, pressing it against the wall to try to hear what was on the other side. Voices. He still couldn't make them out too well and had to strain to listen, then nearly dropped the glass when he realized it was the Marauders. At least Sirius, talking about trying to break in—or so he got from the garbled words he managed to hear.No. He backed away from the wall. No, no, no, no. They had snuck into Hogsmeade and were trying to break in.Remus fell to his butt, trying not to cry out. They were only a few feet away, just on the other side of the wall! He felt like he might vomit. Another thud. He crawled over, ignoring the pain flaring up in his legs, feeling some of the wounds breaking again, then sat next to the wall. James was talking now. At least he was feeling well enough to go sneaking off. Then Sirius said something, sounding right on the other side, as if he were up against the wall. Something about getting in.Remus got up, panicking. They couldn't get in, right? No. No way could some twelve year olds could do that! Still...He looked down at the glass in his hand then without even thinking threw it at the wall. The glass shattered, and he heard a frightened yelp that was probably Peter. Then silence. He ran over, pressing his ear. He thought he heard something about ghosts, then it went quiet and remained quiet. He listened in for a good long while then figured they had left.Remus hurried to the bathroom to relieve himself, as his bladder had nearly emptied itself during that! Then he returned to the living room to clean up the shards of glass with very shaky hands, noticing a new bloodstain on the floor and on his sweatpants where the wound on his calf had reopened. He couldn't tell anyone because he didn't want to get them in trouble but... what if they tried again? Why were they even there?James wanted to come during a full moon, what if they return tonight? Then an even worse thought, What if they were outside last night? He dumped the glass in the trash, hoping the wolf wouldn't claw into it. Probably would.Then he sat on the couch, too shaken up to do much besides freak out until sleep overcame him once more.

On Sunday morning Remus woke up in a lot of pain. His left arm was essentially useless. He pushed himself up onto his right side, staring at the gashes and bites all over his thin arm, the exposed muscles, his hand flopping when he tried to move his arm. He focused on moving his fingers but only one of them twitched a little.I need to go to the hospital, he thought, struggling to get to his feet. He had some pain in his side and legs but no where near as bad as his arm. He went into the bathroom, rinsing off his right hand before grabbing the piece of chalk. He stared dizzily at the board which had some vague smears on it making him think the wolf had come in to check on the item, reminding himself he needed to be honest with Pomfrey. The board faded in and out of vision as unconsciousness threatened to take over.I don't want to go in though. What could Pomfrey do? She couldn't heal it. Just wrap it up. He bit his bottom lip then carefully wrote, All good this morning. He set the chalk down, guilt eating away at him for lying. Pomfrey's response soon showed up, stating that she was glad to hear that.Then Remus fell to the floor, passing out from the blood loss and pain/\/\/\/\/\He came to feeling weak and ill. He lay on the floor staring blankly at the bathroom ceiling for a moment then dragged himself into the shower, crying out when the hot water hit his body. He went in and out of consciousness for a bit then finally felt somewhat decent enough to push himself into a sitting position, watching the bloody water going down the drain. His wounds weren't healed-healed but they had healed enough to not be bleeding anymore. They were still nasty, though, and a couple of them started bleeding when he tried wiping them clean. He did his best to clean off the rest of his body then hauled himself out of the shadow, having to pull himself to his feet with the help of the toilet, so he could reach a towel. Once mostly dry he sat down to put bandages on. Even though he wasn't as risk for any infection (his lycanthropic genes would destroy any intruder) he used some of the wound cleaning salve Pomfrey told him about.Remus left the bathroom, staring at the stairs. He needed to go upstairs to get his clothes. You can do it. He took in a deep breath then began going up. It wasn't quite as bad as he expected and he managed to get himself to the bedroom. The wardrobe was in an even worse state than the night before. He had to wrestle with the door a bit (one handed) to get it open, then pulled his loose clothing out. He felt overwhelmed with the thought of getting dressed then, gritting his teeth, got the t-shirt on over his head, slipped his right arm through, and sucked in some air as he got his left arm in as well which hurt so bad. His vision splintered around him. He sat down on the edge of the bed to take a break, panting a bit from the exertion. Then he got the sweatpants on, having to wriggle a lot to pull them up then it took him a lot of effort to get it somewhat tied.He was absolutely starving but the thought of going back downstairs was too much. Maybe shouldn't have lied, he thought, carefully laying back on the bed, soaked in sweat. It would be tiring going back to the hospital wing but then he wouldn't have to take care of himself. That's what Professor McGonagall and Madame Pomfrey were going on about, he realized miserably. He didn't want to think about that any more so he just pushed himself farther onto the bed and fell asleep./\/\/\/\/\Remus woke up screaming and thrashing, which sent massive amounts of pain crashing through his body. He rolled over, falling out of bed which made him see stars, and vomited, the nightmare replaying over and over. The Marauders breaking into his house, and him killing them, ripping them to pieces."Merlin... no..." he sobbed, cheek pressed against the bedroom floor inches from the puddle of sick, right hand clutching at his head as the images of James, Sirius, and Peter's dismembered bodies burned into his brain. He could still feel his teeth sinking into their flesh, taste their blood. He gave another sob and pushed himself up in time to vomit again. He rolled onto his back, whimpering with each breath. He felt sweaty and hot, his arm in utter pain once more. Slowly he forced himself to sit up and peel back the bandaged, fresh blood oozing down, soaking into the t-shirt. He took in a deep breath and pushed himself to his feet, staggering downstairs, silent tears rolling down his face. He stumbled into the bathroom to clean himself off once more and rebandage the arm.Once he took a rest from doing that he went to try and find something he could easily, quickly do one handed. He wound up eating some hard boiled eggs, cold chicken, a chunk of cheese, and some bread. Just plopped it all onto a plate, plowing through the food, feeling too much like an animal for not even using silverware. He kept his left arm cradled close to his body.After eating he returned to the bathroom to take care of business, and when he went to wash his hands he recoiled at his own reflection, how horrifyingly pale he was. He looked even more on death's door than he did when he argued with James. Sighing, he rubbed his eyes, knowing once his blood started replenishing he'd look better.After cleaning up the sick, Remus spent the rest of the day alternating sleeping and trying to get food in his system. At least he was so distracted from the pain and exhaustion that when he was awake he didn't have time to worry about his friends trying to break in again even though that was the main show whenever he slept, pulling him violently out of his sleep with screams and sobs. His arm was still in bad shape just before sunset, though, and when he woke up in the morning it felt like his entire body was covered in gashes. He had just gotten into the bathroom to tell Pomfrey he was all right when he remembered it was Monday now, and the moon was over; Pomfrey would be coming regardless. He was still in the shower when she came into the house."I—it's the worst it has been all we—weekend," he promised weakly when she pursed her lips at the sight of all his wounds. "Honest. I—I was going to write that I needed help, before remembering what day it was.""I'm not sure if I believe you, Mr. Lupin, however I don't have much of a choice." She bandaged up all his wounds, helped him into some hospital pajamas, then guided him out—or started to. He pulled away, hobbling up the stairs to get all the things left in the wardrobe which was nearly in pieces."Um..." He felt embarrassed to mention it when he came back down, except he needed to. "Um, the—the wardrobe upstairs... where I keep my things... I—I don't know why... but the w—I... I have been attacking it all weekend. It's in dire need of repair. I don't think it would hold up another night."Pomfrey nodded. "I'll inform Minerva. Have there been any other issues?"He nearly said no then realized there were two other things he needed to mention. Well, one he needed to mention, one he wanted to mention. "I was wondering if maybe—maybe... if it's n-not too much trouble, if I could... be provided with the means to make those, um, shakes you made me last year? I can make them the—the night before then store them in the fridge, so the house-elves don't need to t-trouble themselves with—""Of course," she said with a smile. "Did you have any trouble eating?""A little," he confessed. "Yesterday morning my hand was hurt. Plus being so tired..."Pomfrey nodded as he spoke. "I'll speak to the house-elves about supplying you with the shakes. Anything else? Was there anything else you were in need of? Any other problems?"He thought of a dozen very minor things that could be added; more blankets, for instance, or the handles in the shower lowered so he could reach from easily from the floor. He didn't want to mention any of that though, they were just small things and he didn't want to appear to be greedy. They were already doing far too much for him, it wouldn't be right to ask for more. Instead he went, "I—I think someone was trying to get into the house on Saturday. I heard a lot of thumps right outside one of the living room windows." He had to inform them of this though would never in a million years admit he knew exactly who had been trying.Pomfrey gave a sigh. "I see. I'll certainly inform Minerva of that as well."They got to the hospital wing, Remus sliding into bed thinking how nice it was to be back here. It felt better. But he did want to remain at the house during the days of the moon. Pomfrey gave him a strawberry shake which he drank down quickly before drifting into sleep, curled up awkwardly with an arm around a pillow./\/\/\/\/\Remus slept through the entire morning, waking twice from the Marauders-breaking-in nightmares, then a third time to a large lunch from Pomfrey. Most the gashes were healing up pretty well, a few of them gave him trouble. There was a faint scratch on his cheek though he thought he could play it off as something not from an animal, at least hoped he could because he wanted to go to class. He still had History and Transfiguration. Pomfrey clucked her disapproval at him getting out of bed. Once she left he took out the uniform he had been wearing Friday, running his hand across the robes, debating whether they were clean enough. It's either this or going all the way to the dorms. He pulled a face and got dressed in the rumpled clothes. He was usually untidy as it was. They didn't smell bad or anything, a vague sort of wolfy scent which he doubted nobody else would pick up on.Of course after lunch was a free period so he was able to put off leaving the hospital wing, put off facing James again. His stomach began hurting as he thought again of the look on James's face when he said 'drop dead'. He tugged at his cuffs, flinching a little when the sleeve tightened around the bandages on his arm. All too soon it was time to go. He put his satchel over his shoulder, heading off to History. The satchel felt heavier than it did Friday even though it carried the same things. Of course, his body was hurting this time round.He reached History one minute before two. He steeled himself as best he could, put a shaking hand on the knob, then pushed the door open. The other Gryffindors glanced over, surprised looks passing over most their faces. Sirius, Peter, and Lily all looked happy to see him. James stared blankly then looked back down at the comic book on his desk.Remus carefully sat down in his seat, in front of Sirius, next to Peter; James was located behind Peter, next to Sirius, and Remus could feel the animosity rolling off his body. Remus's heart sank. He had really hoped James would have calmed down some over the weekend, especially with the trip to Hogsmeade, but obviously not.Binns began teaching. Remus took notes while chewing on his nails, wishing he had the nerve to send James a note. He glanced back a couple times towards the other boy, once when he thought he felt James's eyes on him however every time James was just reading the comic book.A note did drop onto Remus's desk. Welcome back - SBHe smiled, wrote back a thanks, and sent it behind him. He expected something back then was a little disappointed when no more notes came. Was Sirius angry at him too? If he was angry, why did he sent the note in the first place? Remus forced himself not to ask why, not to look desperate. The class grew long as he sat in misery, trying not to cry. Have I lost them? Maybe over the weekend James decided he hated Remus entirely, and Sirius and Peter agreed with him. His writing became shakier and even more incomprehensible until finally—finally—class ended. Remus shut his book, swept everything into his satchel, then left the room."Remus!" Lily hurried over to him, grabbing his arm. He couldn't stop the cry of pain and Lily let go, eyes going wide. "I'm sorry!" She stared at him, visibly worried."I'm f—fine," he got out. "You just startled me."She looked like she didn't believe him. "O...kay... Um, is your mother doing better?""Yes, thank you." He looked past her, at the other Marauders coming out. Sirius was stretching, saying something that made Peter laugh. Remus averted his gaze."You've got a scratch on your face..."He touched his cheek. "Yeah, um, my—my mum's cat. Hi," he said as Sirius and Peter came over, trying not to sound hopeful or even surprised they were approaching him. They asked after his mother, nodding when he said she was fine. James was hovering a few feet away, arms folded. There was an awkward stretch of silence. Lily kept looking at Remus then the other Marauders.Finally Sirius slung an arm around Remus's shoulders (this time he managed not to yelp) and said, "I'll walk with Remus to Transfiguration." Peter nodded, told Remus he was glad he was back, then returned to James's side. The two of them walked off together."Okay, what was that about?" Lily asked as the three of them headed to class. Sirius dropped his arm away from Remus which he rather wished Sirius hadn't done; the weight, the warmth had felt nice. Plus just the fact he was making physical contact also felt nice.Sirius glanced at Remus who sighed heavily. "James is... mad at me. For good reason," he added quickly as she opened her mouth. "I need to talk to him. Is he... is he really angry?" he asked Sirius."I think he's upset more than angry," Sirius drawled out. "Pete was right about why he acted the way he did, by the way."Remus closed his eyes, wishing he could go back in time and change how things went. He should have just let them fuss, should have just agreed to go to the hospital wing. He fretted all the way to Transfiguration, loads of questions for Sirius rising to his tongue which he held back. In the end, he didn't say anything else before they went in to their next class. He was barely able to do the work McGonagall set out then was torn between annoyance and relief when she asked him to stay behind. That meant he didn't have to be rebuked by James, however it also meant putting off trying to talk to him. He watched his friends leave then moved to a seat closer to her desk when she motioned for him to do so."I was curious as to how your weekend went," she said, folding her hands on the desk.Remus set his satchel in his lap, fiddling with one of the clasps. "Um, f-fine, really. I slept most the days."Professor McGonagall nodded. "Any troubles?"Oh, right. "Yes... someone tried to get into th—the house on Saturday. There were loud thumps against one of the living room w-windows. I heard vo—voices but didn't hear what they were saying."She frowned quite deeply at that. "Poppy did inform me of this. It is a little worrying, and I will speak to Albus of course. She also mentioned that the wardrobe in the master bedroom is falling apart?"Remus felt his cheeks heating up. "N-not so much falling apart as it is being t—torn apart." He looked at his hands fumbling with the clasp then suddenly felt an urge to cry. He bent forward so his hair fell across his face, hating himself more and more. Animal, nothing but an animal. His fingers curled slightly."Mr. Lupin." He looked back up, hoping the distress didn't show in his eyes. "Are you all right?""Yes," he lied. "Embarrassed, a bit.""No need to be, it isn't as if you're doing it yourself," she said. Remus frowned, wanting to argue with her because it was him doing it. The other part of him. But she began talking again, not allowing him time to try and explain. "I'll go in sometime soon and fix up the wardrobe as best I can. Is there anything else? You seemed quite distracted in class."He looked down once more. "Only tired, Professor.""You don't need to come to classes on days like this...""I—I know. But I like to, when I can."There was a bit of silence then McGonagall rose to her feet. "You may go." He quickly got to his feet then hesitated when she said, "If there's anything else going on, Mr. Lupin, feel free to talk to me."He swallowed heavily. "Thank you, Professor," he said. "I'll be—be fine." He left, breathing out a slight sigh of relief as he shut the door behind him.Peter was sitting across the hall. "Hey!" He got up, smiling. "Sirius went off with James. Um, I hope it's okay I waited..."Remus shouldered his bag. "I'm glad you did," he replied honestly, not wanting to confess he had assumed none of them would be waiting."So, your mum's doing okay?" Peter fell into step with him, the two of them walking even though Remus wasn't sure where to go. "I was kinda worried that maybe that—um, you know, the cure thing you said you guys took? That since it didn't work it might have made things worser."Remus bit back the correction of there being no such word. "Thankfully not," he replied. "She wasn't great however she's had it worse before.""Missed you this weekend.""I... missed you too..." He gave Peter a smile then Peter bumped gently against him. Remus managed not to wince in pain. "Did you do anything fun?""Ooooh! We went into Hogsmeade!""Again? So soon?"Pete shrugged. "James wanted to.""What did you do?" Remus hoped he sounded casual enough."Not much, really. We went to the Three Broomsticks cause they both wanted to get butterbeer, then we went to the, um, ingredients place cause they've got an idea for a potion to make. We also went to the haunted house cause they wanted to try to break in.""Ooh, did you manage?"Peter's eyes got enormous. "No, but a ghost attacked Sirius.""What?" Remus covered his mouth, trying not to laugh as well."He was up against the wall when—well, I'm not sure what exactly happened. He says he was attacked. You can ask him later. We ran off after that, cause Sirius said the ghosts were angry with us."It was so hard not to give in to the laughter. He bit the inside of his cheek until he tasted blood, managing to fight off the amusement. Later on, Sirius told him the story of how they were trying to get in when the window shattered right in his face and a weird ghost howled at them to go away; Remus had to pretend to be suitably impressed while inwardly laughing at how dramatic his friend was. "I'm glad he's okay," he finally managed to say. Pete nodded in agreement. "So, erm... about... James..."Peter shrugged. "I dunno, he didn't want to talk about it at all. Whenever Sirius or I mentioned you he just sorta... scowled." He wrung his hands. "He did talk about his grandfather a few times though..." Remus closed his eyes, guilt hurting him once more. "Then at one point said why were we worried about you when it was clear you didn't want us to care?"Remus frowned, looking down at his shoes. "I... it isn't... I—I don't... mind you caring, I just... it's..."Peter reached out, resting a hand on his arm. "Hey. It's all right. I know you just want your privacy. And, um, that's okay. With me. I-I'm sorry if I bothered you or anything. It's hard not to worry, but I'll try not to pressure you about it."Remus looked back up into his warm brown eyes. He wanted so bad to hug Peter, but also didn't dare, so instead he punched Pete's arm very lightly, thanking him. Pete grinned back, punching his arm back just as lightly although it still hurt a bit./\/\/\/\/\Remus and Peter hung out in a courtyard until supper then went into the Great Hall. Peter immediately went over to James and Sirius. Remus very reluctantly followed. Sirius smiled at Remus while James just hunched over his food, jabbing at it with a fork. Remus sat down across from the two and began putting food on his plate. Sirius and Peter started chattering, filling the awkward silence. Occasionally Remus would look at James, and once in a while he felt James's eyes on him.Finally he couldn't stand it any longer."J... James?" he asked very timidly. Sirius fell silent. James just ate, acting as if he hadn't heard him. "James?" he tried again with the same response. "Um. I—I'm... I'm sorry...""Could you pass the mustard?" James asked Sirius pleasantly. Sirius raised his eyebrow then pushed the dish over. "Thank you."Remus bit his lip. "James, I'm sorry—""So, I think our first game is going to be against Ravenclaw," James said, slathering mustard onto a sandwich. "We won't get the official matches until next month, of course."Sirius and Peter looked at each other while Remus curled his hands into fists, fighting the itching in his nose, fighting off the tears. "James!"James slammed his knife down, rattling the dishes, causing Remus to flinch. "What!?""I—" His voice broke a little and he had to take in a deep breath before he could continue. It didn't help that those sitting nearby had heard this and were now watching with curiosity. "I'm sorry."James blinked then picked the knife up, cutting his sandwich in half. "Why? What for?""Wh—what? I—""I mean, to be sorry means you care, and obviously friends don't care about friends, do they?""James—""So you've got nothing to be sorry for, right?" He jammed the knife down again, this time blade first so it stuck into the table. "I don't even understand why you're pretending."Remus slumped back a little, feeling as though James had just taken the knife to his chest. There were whispers from the nearby students while Sirius had gone paler than normal and Peter was chewing at his lip so roughly that he began bleeding. Everyone seemed to be waiting for Remus to react, including James.Remus swung his legs out from the bench, grabbed his satchel, and left the Great Hall. He began running as soon as he was out of sight of the doors, managing to hold back the tears until he got outside.He went down to the lake, finding a private spot in which to cry. There was an outcropping of rocks behind him so he was well hidden. Or so he assumed. After only a couple minutes of hugging his knees and staring despondently out over the water he heard a noise somewhere behind/above him then suddenly Sirius's face appeared upside down right in front of his."Heyo!" Sirius said cheerfully as Remus yelped and jumped back, smacking against the rock. He glanced up to see that Sirius was clinging to the rocks, hanging down over him. It was probably the least elegant Remus had ever seen him yet he still looked terrific even with his hair hanging down and his face going red. Then he wriggled, did a flip, and crashed into the sand in front of Remus with a pained yelp."Are... you a—all right?""Yeah, I guess." Sirius rubbed his backside then scooted back against the rocks next to Remus, going right into the heart of things. "He shouldn't have said that."Remus hugged his knees tighter, wiping his eyes off on his sleeves. "I really hurt him.""And he really hurt you." Sirius hesitated then slowly put his arm around Remus's shoulder, obviously trying to comfort him. "He's an idiot.""I shouldn't have said what I did." He resisted the urge to move closer to Sirius. "He hates me now.""Pffft." With his other hand Sirius ran his fingers through his hair. "This whole thing started cause he was worried about you. I doubt he hates you. I mean, I guess that's not something I can say for sure..." Remus stretched his legs out, digging the toes of his shoes into the sand. "Remy, we were doing something that upset you, it's fine to... to tell us off when we do that.""Apparently not," he sniffled. He remembered one of his fights with Lily, when Fawley had said there'd be times he fought with all his friends. He never really... argued much with the Marauders before. It felt so different than fighting with Lily. It still had that same soul-squeezing misery however there was another layer that caused even more pain."Again, he is being an idiot.""Isn't he your best friend?"Sirius shrugged. "Your point? He's my best friend and he's being a total idiot. Those two things aren't... umm... ummmm...""Mutually exclusive?" Remus offered, figuring it was the most fitting phrase to what Sirius was trying to say."Maybe." Sirius squinted. "What's that mean?"Remus couldn't help but smile. "Two things that can't coincide with one another. So if they are not mutually exclusive, they can occur together." He pushed down into the sand some more till it covered half his shoes. "Hopefully he'll forgive me..."Sirius straightened up, frowning. "Don't let him get away with not apologizing to you.""Huh?"Sirius pulled his arm away from Remus so he could fully face him, grabbing his shoulders. "He's been a dick to you. When you guys make up, he needs to apologize to you too, not just you apologizing to him, all right?"Remus stared up into Sirius's eyes. "It—it's not—it's not—not that—""If you say it's not important I'll thump you."Remus pulled away from him, drawing his knees back up. "Well, it isn't.""My left foot it isn't," Sirius growled. But even though he folded his arms, he sat back. Then he elbowed Remus until he looked over. Sirius made a face. Then put his fingers in the corners of his mouth, making an even weirder face. He stuck his tongue out, rolled his eyes back, and made a eeeaaaaaaa sound. Remus began giggling a bit. Sirius continued making outrageous faces until the giggling turned into laughter. Then he sat back again, grinning victoriously. He reached over, tousling Remus's hair. "It'll be okay," he promised.Remus silently hoped he was right."Remus?""Yes?"Sirius met his gaze, brow furrowed just slightly. "If there's anything... going on with you... I won't push anymore about what you have, but... you can trust me. With anything."Remus slowly nodded, sweating slightly. "I know," he whispered, curling his fingers against his trousers. "Thank you."Sirius waited for a few seconds and when it was apparent Remus wasn't going to say anything else he looked back out over the lake, resting his head back against the rock.

Author's note: Hey guys so after much thought about it I decided to do some one shots for this series. Basically scenes Remus experienced only told from someone else's POV, or else scenes Remus really didn't know about. The first one is up, and it is James's POV from chapter 24. I have a few ideas for one shots in mind but if any of you have a scene you'd like to see from someone else's POV please feel free to suggest it! I can't promise I'll do it, but I might... plus I like getting ideas and knowing what you might like to see will help :) I will say one of the one shots I am considering doing is from when Remus was hanging out with Lily, Alice, and Cassandra, and the one kid was staring at Remus. I kinda wanna do that written from the other kid's POV, the one staring at Remus. Thing is, A, you don't know this character yet and won't until Remus's third or fourth year, and B, it will reveal a secret that wouldn't otherwise be revealed until Remus's fifth year. Since nobody has any connection to this character yet, I wasn't sure if this is something you'd be interested in or not, or if I should wait. Anyway, enough rambling. Enjoy the chapter!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\At study group of course everyone wanted to know what happened. The rumor of James snapping at Remus had spread, and of course everyone had seen Remus run out of the Great Hall. He mumbled that he didn't want to talk about it. Bones and Twycross both tried to question him further but Lily shot them down, telling them if they didn't want to study then they could go. Bones laughed, apologizing, while Twycross went first white then red with anger, speaking in a snappish tone for the remainder of the evening.Remus stayed in the library after study group finished, putting off facing James again. Silverlocke remained with him, making small talk for a while as they worked on their essays. They had never been particularly close though Remus would like to get to know him better. There was something very calming and gentle about the Slytherin, something he didn't get from his other friends. The other Marauders were high energy, while Lily was so vivid and excited.Remus wasn't very aware of the fact he wasn't really writing, mostly staring blankly at the bookshelves with the occasional sigh. Finally Silverlocke asked, "Are you sure you're doing all right, Mr. Lupin?"Remus blinked a few times, setting his quill down. "Just a lot on m—my mind.""Mr. Potter?" Silverlocke inquired, raising his eyebrows. Remus slowly nodded. "I do not know the extent of what happened, however considering how close you are with them I doubt he will stay mad for long.""I dunno. I said... some not so great things," he admitted. "I tried apologizing b-but he wasn't having it.""I'm very sorry," Silverlocke said, sounding as though he meant it. "I hope he comes around soon.""Th—thank you." Remus smiled at him then felt rather awkward as he asked, "W—would it be all right to—" Then he stopped, unable to continue.Silverlocke tilted his head. "What is it?""N-nothing. It's nothing." Remus picked up his quill returning to working on his Herbology essay. He had wanted to know if it was all right to be on first name basis, but had chickened out. He was a little afraid of Silverlocke just looking at him going 'we aren't friends just study buddies' or something like that. Silverlocke watched him for another few seconds then returned to his own schoolwork./\/\/\/\/\Remus gladly returned to the dorm that night, absolutely worn out (also a little surprised to find the furniture had been removed from the ceiling sometime while he had been away). It had been a very long day and he still hurt in some areas from his transformation. James, Sirius, and Peter were goofing off in the common room when Remus went through. Sirius and Peter hesitated when they saw him but he gave them a shrug and shook his head, to indicate he'd rather they just stay with James. he climbed up the staircases and went to take a long, hot shower. It felt very good and he stood in the shower for longer than normal, eyes closed, feeling the water streaming down his tired body. He felt more like an old man than a twelve-year-old, at the end of a weary life instead of just beginning.He finally turned the water off, slowly drying off, then going into the dorm room. Spinnet and Struthers were there, both of them eyeing Remus as he climbed into his bed and shut the curtain. Within a minute one of them knocked at his bedpost. Remus pushed open his curtains, expecting Struthers, then flinching back when he realized it was Spinnet."Hey," Spinnet said."I—I won't be loud," he promised, expecting to be told to leave. "I just don't f-feel like b-b-being in the—the c—common room."Struthers snorted while Spinnet looked vaguely embarrassed, rubbing the back of his head. "Er, it... it's not that. I just..." He looked over at Struthers who nodded. "I wanted to know if you wanted to play exploding snaps with us?"Remus was startled by this. "Why?" he asked before he could stop himself. "Wh—why would you want me?"A flash of anger went across his face which made Remus regret talking period. Then it diminished. "I know I was a bit of a jerk last year." Understatement, Remus thought, remaining silent. "Well, it's just—you know, it seems like there's something going on between you and... the others... so if you wanted to hang out with us that'd be... all right."Ah. Remus saw Struthers looking a little eager, feeling bad that he flat out didn't want to. David Struthers was very nice. Morrander Spinnet... not so much. He didn't think he could easily shake off all the horrible things Spinnet had said to him, about him. He would never forget that one night when he had had a particularly horrifying nightmare and Spinnet's response was to try to use the full body bind on him. Remembering this sent a wave of anger through his body and he met Spinnet's eyes sternly."No. Th-thank you." He yanked his curtains close, laying back onto his bed.The bed curtains were all spelled (except for Sirius's) and for most people it was difficult to hear past the absorption spells, so when Spinnet talked to Struthers it was with the assumption Remus couldn't hear him. "Stuck up little tosser."Remus considered doing nothing but his body seemed to move on its own accord. He pulled the curtains back open, kneeling on the end of his bed to glare at a startled Spinnet. "And that is precisely why I don't want to hang out with you!" he snapped then pulled the curtains shut once more."Wh-wha—did—how could he hear me?!" Spinnet stammered out, causing Remus to grin. "Lupin! Oi, Lupin!" Remus remained silent, pretending as if he couldn't hear him until the curtains opened."Do you mind?" Remus asked in a clipped tone."How did you hear me?" Spinnet demanded."My curtains were not shut all the way," he lied. "Leave me alone." He pulled them back shut, enjoying hearing Spinnet spluttering and complaining to Struthers, enjoying even more when he heard Struthers say that Spinnet deserved it."He is stuck up!" Spinnet argued. "And a tosser, they all are! Think they're so special, swanning around the school like they own it! Thought Lupin would be a little knocked down now that Potter's dropped him, but apparently he still thinks he's high and mighty! He's a lunatic. Loopy, indeed.""Please stop," Struthers said softly. "He isn't that bad. He's very nice. Nicer than Black and Potter.""Hmph. Crazier than them too, which is saying something.""Andy. Just drop it, all right?""Fine."Remus tried to study more but wound up drifting into sleep, waking up with a jerk when the other Marauders banged into the room. They were very noisy, James turning on the radio immediately. Remus sat back up, pulling his book onto his lap, only looking up when Sirius and Peter checked up on him. When Peter did he could see James beyond him who quickly turned his head when he saw Remus. Remus promised his friends he was fine, didn't feel like getting out of bed, thank you.Finally when the dorm quieted he pulled Gwyllgi out from under his pillow and curled up with him, clinging to him tightly./\/\/\/\/\Tuesday morning Remus just sat with Lily, Colgate, and Inkwood so Sirius and Peter wouldn't have to decide who sat with whom. While they weren't talking about boys or makeup this time, they were discussing Quidditch which was equally as boring to Remus. He sat with them in Herbology too, while Eloise Nettle nabbed the fourth seat at the Marauders' table."Just talk to him," Colgate said as they left Herbology, covered in dirt as usual."I will... e—eventually..." Remus watched the back of James's head as the other Marauders dashed towards the castle. At least next was a free period before lunch so they were all able to go get showers. Remus hoped to be able to speak to James at some point during the end of the morning however the other boy very intensely avoided him.He sat with the girls at lunch again, feeling sicker and sicker. Lily was very quiet for the most part, though at one point she said how much of a jerk James was being. Remus murmured that it was all his own fault, which Lily didn't believe.After lunch came Defense. Professor Prewett gave a lecture then paired everyone off for dueling. Remus wound up with Nettle, unsure whether it would have been better or worse to be with James. After class Prewett asked Remus to stay behind meaning he was unable to try to talk to James, knowing his friend(?) would be long gone by the time he got out. Prewett wanted to know how the full moon went, more curious than disgusted, then he gave Remus a new list of essays to write."Please take your time with these," he said as Remus took the sheet of parchment.Sure enough when he left James was gone with Peter, Sirius staying behind to spend some time with Remus who wondered if they did wand-cauldron-book to decide which would stay behind. Sirius cracked jokes as they walked through the halls, trying his best to cheer Remus up. Remus appreciated it but barely managed a smile, finally telling him to just go find James."I should work on homework anyway," he said, patting his satchel."I'll go with you," Sirius said, trailing behind him as he went to the library."You d-don't need to."Sirius nudged him. "I know I don't need to, but I want to."Remus figured Sirius would just goof off so he was quite surprised when he actually settled down, working on some of their assignments—though occasionally whispering a joke or pun. This time Remus did manage actual smiles, very grateful for his friend./\/\/\/\/\Occlumency went poorly. Remus was in too much of a distressed state to fight against Fawley. He didn't ask her for any advice this time, suspecting it'd be much the same as when he and Lily fought. Fawley did tell him how sorry she was this was happening, agreeing with him (and Peter) that it was probably because of the connection to his grandfather dying over the summer.Remus left Occlumency a bit early, head pounding. James would be at Quidditch practice still and Remus considered going to show his support then changed his mind, not wanting to make James angrier. So he went back to his dorm to curl up in bed with a cool, damp cloth against his forehead, and Gwyllgi against his chest.Eventually the door opened and his friends came in. They seemed unaware he was there, although Sirius did check under Remus's bed... just not in it. After Sirius stated Remus wasn't back yet, the others began talking; Remus sorta hoped maybe James would say something that could unlock the best way to apologize but they just talked about the practice, and how awesome James had been. Soon Struthers and Spinnet came in as well, then finally there was a tentative knock at his bedpost. Remus sat up, pushing the curtains back."Oh!" Sirius smiled. "You are here.""Yeah, been here s-since getting back from the—the hospital wing," he said quietly. When he mentioned the hospital wing he saw James's body twitch slightly then James resumed changing into his pajamas, back to Remus."You didn't say anything," Sirius said.Remus pointedly looked at James then back at Sirius who began frowning now. "I just w-want to rest," he said, withdrawing a little. "G'nite.""Um, all right. Uhh... g—good night."The curtains shut and one by one the other boys went to sleep except for James and Sirius, who—by the sound of things—stayed up in James's bed. They thought, of course, Remus couldn't hear them."You need to talk to him," Sirius said darkly."I can't," James replied, more distraught than Remus expected."I don't think he's mad at you, I think he's just hurt," Sirius continued, echoing exactly what he had said about James to Remus the day before. Remus stirred a little, confused. How could James think Remus was angry?! He'd been trying to apologize since he came back from the full moon! He thought back to what he had said, wondering if his tone hadn't been right. Had he done something wrong? Said it the wrong way? Maybe he just thought he had apologized properly when it reality he completely failed, as always, at being a normal human."I don't wanna talk about it," James grumbled. "If all you came over here for is to lecture me then go away. I get enough of that from McGonsie.""I'll go to bed then.""Oh, so that is the only reason you came over?""Jimmy, I don't like seeing you two at odds. You're both my friend. Now, I'm not going to take sides. Neither is Petey. We're both here for both of you. Just... try to at least listen to him, all right?""Go away."Remus heard Sirius return to his bed, and James making grumbling sort of noises until they both faded into sleep. Remus just lay awake for ages, frustrated at James, frustrated at himself./\/\/\/\/\At least Sirius's intrusion hadn't made James too angry as they went down to breakfast together the next morning. Wednesdays they didn't have class until eleven, so they were able to stay in bed pretty late. Remus opted to just stay in bed after getting dressed for the day, to work on homework while eating some of the snacks he had hidden in his desk. Peter stayed with him, reading a magazine, making light banter while Remus essentially rewrote an essay he had written for Dedenne the previous year. He had more knowledge about the matter now and was able to fill it up even more. Prewett had asked for fourteen inches and Remus quickly achieved that, adding even more. Prewett didn't specify a limit so...James and Sirius came back into the dorm, laughing loudly at how much trouble they had gotten into for going down to breakfast in their pajamas."We don't have class for ages so I don't know what the big deal is," James said with a shrug.Sirius snickered. "I agree, Professor McGonsie was just fussing over nothing at all." He tossed his hair back as he marched to his dresser to get out a uniform. "Remus, are there any rules about not going to breakfast in your pajamas?"Remus chewed at the end of his quill, going over the school rules in his head. "I don't think there's anything specifically about not attending meals in your pajamas however there is a rule about being adequately dressed at all times outside the dorms.""I'm adequately dressed!" Sirius protested, spinning around in his silky black pajamas. "You can't see anything!""I'm wearing what I'd wear to work out in," James said, indicating his sweatpants and t-shirt. "I'd go to Quidditch practice in this if it wasn't when we had to wear our uniforms."Remus bit his bottom lip. "I—I think perhaps it's the slippers."James looked down at his bunny slippers and then grinned for about half a second before realizing he was interacting with Remus. The smile immediately disappeared and he went over to get out a clean uniform, shoulders stiff. Remus ducked his head, clenching his teeth a little. It seemed for a blissful instant that things could go back to how they were but nope.Sirius hesitated as he held his uniform. "I'm going to go get changed," he said then shot Peter a look. "You should too.""I wi—" Peter started then stopped, realizing what Sirius meant, what he was conveying with his intense eyes. "Oh! Yeah, yeah. Okay!" He shut his magazine, scrambling to get a uniform too. The only Marauder that fully changed in front of other people was James, so it wasn't unusual for the two of them to go to the bathroom. Just very obvious what they were trying to achieve.Remus stared helplessly as they headed to the door and James turned. "Sirius—" he said but the two disappeared through the door, shutting it behind them. James just stood there frozen for a second then he began pulling out his clothes.Remus wanted to just run, or hide under his bed, but... well, he might as well try again, though was very annoyed with Sirius and Peter for essentially forcing him into this at this point. Then again, if they hadn't he'd probably have just kept putting it off. He was too afraid of constant rejection, of James just pushing him away. He didn't want to believe that this was what changed everything, but he supposed anything could be the reason for friends breaking apart...I don't want to lose him though, he thought as he took in a deep breath. I can't. Not yet. Please. "J... James?" Remus hoped that finally the other boy would listen to him, accept at least a little communication. James's body stiffened but he continued to get dressed. Remus waited until he at least had his boxers and trousers on, not wanting to try this while he was essentially naked. Once he began buttoning up his shirt Remus tried again. "Can we please talk?""No."Remus drew in a sharp breath, trying to tamp down his irritation. "I am very sorry. For everything I said." James finished buttoning his shirt and began putting his belt on. "James..." James was breathing a little raggedly and Remus figured he was holding in his temper. "I'm sorry," he said again, standing up. "I shouldn't have been so harsh—"Then he stopped realizing the strange sound wasn't him holding his temper in, but holding tears back. He was still fumbling with his belt, cheeks glistening slightly. He swore softly then yanked the belt out of the loops, throwing it across the room. He just stood there for a few seconds, arms tight to his side, then began tucking the shirt into his pants. His breath was coming out in soft gasps now."J... James..."James's stony armor finally broke, and in a manner that took Remus completely by surprise because James's words seemed completely out of no where although later Remus realized it was all connected in James's head."He's dead." James let out a sob, swaying slightly before falling down onto his knees, covering his face. "He's dead—and all I c-c-could do w—was stand th-there like a-a-a lump." Remus had no idea what to do as James cried. James never cried. Peter had cried a few times though not much, mostly over small things, quick tears from being bullied. Remus knew Sirius had cried in private a few times and even then Remus was unsure how much. But James had never once cried as far as Remus knew in over a year of knowing him."James..." Remus went over, kneeling down next to him."He wanted to hold my hand." His voice was muffled from his hands, difficult to understand from the crying. "Me and Dad both. I didn't. I—I couldn't, I was too scared. He w-w-was dying and I c-couldn't even..." He pressed his hands harder into his eyes, hunching over. "He d—died not—not having—his l-l-last wish..."Remus put his arms around James, holding him tightly, not knowing what else to do, what to even say. He was surprised this was coming out now, after a few weeks of school, but he supposed it had just been building up inside of him. Maybe James had just bottled it up, trying to ignore it. Remus recalled the letter James had sent, about the nightmares he had of his grandfather pulling him into the coffin to be buried with him. Was this why?"It's okay," Remus said, forehead against James's shoulder."I couldn't. I couldn't. He was dying and—and I couldn't even...""I—I'm sure he understood." Remus felt awful for not knowing what else to say. He hoped he was saying the right thing. He wanted to point out that it wasn't quite right for someone to expect a twelve year old to be able to do something like that, however he knew that would be the wrong thing.James twisted, gripping Remus's vest. "I thought things had—gotten better for you. You were so good at first, but then—then you looked so bad—I just—I w-was so scared you—I—you looked... looked..."Remus knew what he looked like, and couldn't begin to imagine what him saying about how it didn't matter if he looked ready to drop dead did to James if that's what was going on through his head at the time."And—and Sirius said—"Remus froze, waiting for James to continue."I didn't want to lose you," James whispered, not at all continuing with whatever Sirius had said. "I thought—I was so scared you were...""I am so sorry for what I said," Remus whispered, rubbing his back, resisting the urge to be selfish and demand to know what Sirius said!?"You—you shouldn't be, I was—I shouldn't have done all that, I just... kept seeing him dying... then kept seeing you dying... you looked like you might..." His fingers scrabbled against Remus's vest, nails catching in the wool. "I thought you—I thought...""I'm not," Remus said, going back to holding him. James gave him a long look, clearly not believing him. "I promise I'm not.""Y... you're not?" he whispered and Remus shook his head. "I... I thought... I really thought..." He sniffled loudly. "After—he was sick for so long... and after he—he died... then you looked—and I g-got to thinking that that's maybe why you—you don't like talking about what you have, because... because... you were... d-dying too..."Remus shook his head. "It's not. I promise. I'm not dying." It's what Sirius had thought... Is that what James meant by 'Sirius said'? Had they discussed it? It made sense...They held onto each other for what felt like an eternity, James's tears slowly fading until he pulled away, sitting back on his heels as he wiped his face off. "I'm sorry, Remy. I'm sorry.""I know," Remus replied, hands falling into his lap. "I'm sorry too."James gave a slight laugh. "I'm surprised you even want to talk to me.""You're my friend. Always." The words came out and Remus immediately regretted them, because one day there would have to be an end, a cut off, a goodbye-forever-no-more-friends.James lurched forward, hugging Remus again. "I got your uniform snotty.""I can change again."James chuckled at that, pulling away once more, wiping his face a little more. "Don't tell the others, please.""I won't.""I..." He trailed off, averting his gaze. "I loved him. I did. He—he was a—I loved him.""I know," Remus said, feeling stupid for his short responses, wishing he was better at doing this."I couldn't..." He sighed, rubbing his forehead. "I couldn't.""It's okay. It's... a lot... to ask of... someone," Remus said slowly, carefully.Thankfully he began nodding. "Dad wasn't upset with me about it, he said—he said the same thing you did, that Granddad would've understood." He began wringing his hands a bit, forehead wrinkled. "I just can't stop thinking about it, him—asking me—wanting—and I just stood there. I-I tried to move but I was so... scared... some Gryffindor I am...""You were still there with him," Remus pointed out. "That's got to take a lot of courage in itself."James just shrugged, fingers twisting together. "My n-nightmares, they—they're cause of that. I l-lied in my letter when—when I said I d-didn't know why I was r-reaching in but—" James rubbed his eyes again, looking distantly at the wall. "I'm sorry I lied in my letter—""No! No, James, it's fine, you—it's fine."James pulled his feet out from under him so he could fully sit on the ground. "He couldn't hardly breathe and—and looked... looked... a lot... like..." He stopped again, trailing into silence."Like I did?" Remus asked hesitantly."Yeah. All pale and—and so thin and—like you did, only a bit worse, I guess. You looked so bad Friday, it just—it scared me so much I just—got so scared you were... you might be... and then you denied being ill but you obviously were and I got so..."Remus reached over, taking one of James's hand without thinking about it. "I am very grateful for how much you care about me, James. I truly am. I'm lucky to have friends like you. Please don't ever think that—that I don't feel that way."James squeezed Remus's hand back. "You really do forgive me though?""Of course I do."James gave him a strange look. "And... and you... do want to be friends?"Remus frowned, wondering where that was coming from. "Of course I do.""Promise?""I promise."They sat like that, holding hands for a few seconds, then James pulled Remus in for another hug, this one very tight, very clingy. "Thank you."Remus hugged tightly back, glad he had managed to navigate through this without angering James, without fumbling over his words. Glad that they had made up. He wished James didn't feel so down about what had happened though he understood perfectly well—probably more than James would ever realize, he understood how easy it was to hate ones self over mistakes and regrets. He wished, though, he could explain to James how he knew he wasn't dying but he could never do that. He could only hope that James would believe him.They let go of one another, getting to their feet, Remus going to get a clean shirt and vest. "Sirius'n'Pete will be pleased," James said as he fetched his belt from where he tossed it."Not as much as I am," Remus said and James smiled at him."I don't want to go to Charms now. I don't know how you do it.""Do what?""Do anything after crying," James said then grimaced. "Aw, crap, I didn't mean..."Remus shrugged. "I tend to cry a lot, I'm aware of that. It's... hard. I usually feel so hollow after, I'd rather just... just...""Hide under your bed?" James asked and Remus nodded. "I get that. I want to go somewhere alone. But... class...""You can skip," Remus said. "I take plenty of notes."James paused in the middle of tying his tie. "Remus Lupin, encouraging me to skive off?" Remus stuck his tongue out. "Tempting.""You've... gone through a lot just now. I'm sure if you talk to Professor McGonagall and explain...""N—no." James paled slightly. "No, I'd rather just go to class. I really don't want anyone else to know." He finished his tie then yanked his vest on over, adjusting his tie again once everything was in place. "N... not even Sirius. Do I look like I've been crying?"Remus studied James's face closely. "A little. If you wash your face off I think you'll be good." He was a little jealous over the fact it was hard to tell that James had cried so much. "I'm going to go change—""You can change in here, I won't look."Remus felt himself heating up, clutching his clothes to his chest. "Um, th—that's okay."He was worried James would get aggravated over this however he just said, "Suit yourself." Then he paused and laughed. "Uniform yourself?" Remus laughed too then headed out, or started to. James took a few quick steps, taking hold on Remus's arm. "Thank you."Remus smiled broadly. "I'm just glad we're—we're friends."James looked like Remus had just blessed him with a cauldron full of diamonds. "Me too."James's eyes shone a bit then he let go of Remus who left, expecting to run into Sirius and Peter however instead of trying to listen in, they had actually given the two boys absolute privacy and were still in the bathroom, sitting on the floor, kicking at each other in some sort of game. They jumped up with Remus came in, both of them giving him questioning looks. Remus dropped his gaze, still smiling. "We're okay now.""Yes!" Sirius pumped his fist while Pete cheered.

Lily gave Remus a happy look when he came into class with an arm around James, James's arm around him. He grinned back at her, sliding into his seat. Once the final student came in, Professor Flitwick cleared his throat for attention, then waved his wand. Half a dozen little footstools floated in from the other room along with a large dining chair. The footstools came to land on the shared desks, the chair in the middle of the room.Flitwick flourished his wand. "Tarantallegra!"The chair began to spasm, its legs flailing every which way as it began to do a very odd sort of dance. It tapped around, going one way before going the other. The class laughed, watching it do this, then Flitwick waved his wand again to stop it."Can anyone tell me about the origin of this spell?" he asked as he drew the wand movement on the blackboard. He didn't even turn around when he said, "Mr. Lupin?"Remus lowered his hand. "The tarantella is a dance from Italy. Th-that provides the base of the spell. The—the 'leg' part is probably due to the fact the sp—spell needs its victim to have legs."Flitwick nodded. "Very good, two points to Gryffindor. As Lupin said, the victim needs to have legs in order to be charmed. You also need to be able to see the victim clearly. The spell is tarantallegra. Say it with me!""Tarantallegra!" everyone chorused."Excellent! Now, pair up and start trying to get these stools to dance!"Sirius and James grabbed Remus at the same time while Peter complained about being on James's other side and unable to reach Remus. Of course Remus had to go with James who gloated while Sirius sulked. James elbowed Remus a few times cheerfully then they readjusted their positions so Sirius and Peter could sit together."Go on," James said.Remus cleared his throat, focused hard, and flourished his wand. "Tarantallegra!" he said clearly, staring at the little footstool. It twitched then the legs jerked a little, very slowly and lazily... but they moved. Flitwick awarded them with five more points. James gave Remus a high five then James began attempting after Remus removed his spell. One leg began kicking quite wildly though the other three remained still. Next to them Sirius and Peter were arguing vehemently as theirs had rolled onto its back with its legs somehow appearing stiffer. They kept trying to put it upright but for some reason it kept rolling into its back which made Remus wonder what the heck they had done with it. Then he jumped at a crashing sound across the room, and a squeal from Lily."Miss Evans!" Flitwick said as her footstool was galloping around the room bucking and kicking, more like a wild horse than a dance."Sorry! Finite incantatum! F—finite incantatum!"The footstool kept rearing back then ran to the door, kicking it open and running out. The entire class except for Remus and Lily began laughing, though Remus had to fight hard not to. Lily's face was deep red."BRILLIANT WORK THERE, EVANS!" James shouted, giving her a thumbs up."Sh-shall I go get it?" Lily asked, getting to her feet.Flitwick eyed the door then slowly shook his head. "No." He gave a cough. "I think we'll let someone else take care of it." He got another footstool from the storage room, giving it to Lily and Colgate. The rest of class passed without much incident then Flitwick assigned homework, sending the kids in their way.James pushed through everyone to reach Lily, congratulating her again on her attempt, inquiring as to what went wrong."Stop it," Lily growled, still red."No, no!" James's eyes went big. "You misunderstand me! I'm impressed! I'd like to do that!"Lily eyed him suspiciously then looked at Remus who shrugged. It certainly sounded like something James would want. "I don't know how I managed, I said the spell perfectly fine and did the wand movement. You'll have to figure it out yourself." She flounced off.James immediately turned to Remus who let out a long sigh. "Yeah, I'll try to figure it out." James grinned and threw his arm around Remus once more as they walked to lunch, Remus gently leaning into James feeling happy./\/\/\/\/\That evening several owls flew through the Great Hall, depositing fancy looking envelopes in front of a variety of students. One was given to James, another to Remus; down the table he noticed Lily got one too."What's this?" James held up the envelope, squinting at his name on the front."Probably a letter saying you're a git," Sirius replied as he carefully drizzled gravy over a flattened section of mashed potatoes, making something artistic."That make me one too?" Remus inquired. Sirius just pulled a face, not responding. Remus opened up his envelope and then pulled a similar face to the one Sirius made. It was an invitation, to a Slug Club dinner. Not a party, merely an informal dinner for the second and third years. It also included a notice saying that after this dinner party the official invitations would go out, and that Remus was a definite candidate.I believe you would be a invaluable addition to the Club! Slughorn had written."What's yours say?" he asked James. It was pretty much the same except where Remus's said 'invaluable', James's said 'wonderful'. Remus crinkled his nose a little at that. "Are you going?""Might," James said, returning to his food and almost immediately dropping some gravy on the letter. "Whoops.""I'm not," Remus said, folding the invitation up to slide into his satchel."Why not?" Pete asked. "I'd go, if I was invited."Remus didn't really answer, just remembered how he felt the previous year when Slughorn invited him to the Christmas dinner. Slughorn insisted it was because of his grades however Remus suspected it was because he was a werewolf. It made him very uncomfortable. James was invited due to his money. At least Lily's was because of her brains. That was different. The other stuff felt a little dirty to Remus, like... weird. He supposed the money thing did make sense, since the Slug Club seemed to be about connections. Famous people. Witches and wizards who did things; but why a werewolf? It made no sense. All he was connected with was being inhuman and despised by society.Remus glanced up at the High Table. Slughorn was chatting away with Professor Sprout. Why? He finally began eating again, deciding he wouldn't worry about it. He wasn't going, after the dinner Slughorn would see he had no interest in the Club, and he hoped that would be that./\/\/\/\/\Now that they were the Marauders once more, the days went by wonderfully. They played pranks, joked around, stayed up way too late most nights, and took another trip out to Fort Dragon on the last day of September. It was a gloriously golden sort of day, fairly warm with a chilly breeze. They hung about the lake until they felt sure nobody was watching then snuck into the forest, making their way through the underbrush. Once at Fort Dragon they began working again, Remus back to trying to figure out a door. This time he managed somewhat of one and they stuck the wall up. Four walls and a crooked roof. It was a fort.Sirius pulled open the door and the entire thing crashed to the ground."Well. Shit," he said, still holding the bit of wood that had been the handle. Remus and Peter were laughing so hard they couldn't breathe, and James stalked back and forth with a pout. Remus and Peter clung to each other to stay upright."I thought you were good at sticking spells!" James complained bitterly, glaring at Sirius."Wasn't my fault! It was Remus's door!" Sirius accused."M-my door?" Remus wheezed. "It wouldn't have caused the entire fort to fold! I think it was the roof.""Oi!" James whirled around, pointing. "The roof is the best bit remaining!" Indeed, half the roof was still intact, laying on top of the entire pile. "Not. My. Fault."Sirius, James, and Remus all began arguing about whose fault it was. Or rather, whose fault it wasn't. Normally Remus would have just stood back in silence but how dare they insist his door had caused all of that?! They continued arguing, voices getting louder. Peter watched in silence, arms tight across his chest, occasionally kicking at a piece of wood."My sticking spells were COMPLETELY FINE until that door!""My door could not have feasibly dismantled the entire building! That is not only completely preposterous but wholly improbable! The roof altered the entire structure and knocked it off balance!""Don't go blaming my roof, it was perfect! It was the spells.""Not my spells!""Not my door.""Not my roof!"They stared at one another then spun around to face Peter who squeaked, shrinking back."Whose fault, Pete?" James asked."Yeah, which part was it?" Sirius demanded.Pete looked at each of them then gulped. "I—I... um... I-I think it was the ground?" He poked at the ground with his foot. "It's kinda muddy still from the rain yesterday."They all now looked down. Remus prodded his toe into the squelchy mud. "He's got a point," he admitted. "Faulty foundation." He looked at the pile of sticks, tilting his head. "We did... push the sticks into the ground, right?" Silence. "Right?""Um." Sirius scratched his head."Errrr..." James rubbed the back of his neck.Peter put his hands out in a helpless manner. Remus pressed his fingertips against his temples. "We just... balanced the fort on the ground without any sort of support?""Mayyyyybe?" Sirius said, squinting. "I mean... well. Yeah, kinda. If you wanna get facts-y about it."Remus let out a soft swear and dropped his head into his hands while Pete began laughing again.James grinned. "Told you it wasn't my roof."/\/\/\/\/\The four of them had just plopped down for brunch on Sunday, having slept in after staying up until three in the morning playing cards, when James announced that they needed costumes. Remus was still really tired and James's proclamation only tired him out even more."For what?" Peter asked, looking around as if suspecting other people were dressed in costumes that very moment."Halloween!" James pointed his fork at Pete. "None of us dressed up last year. I say we have a group costume this year.""Like what?" Sirius asked, looking quite intrigued. He snaked a hand over, stealing a sausage from Remus's plate."Halloween is thirty days away," Remus yawned, trying to smack Sirius's hand away and failing. He scowled, getting another sausage from the platter that was right in front of Sirius."So?" James dumped food on his plate, shaking his head. "We need loads of time to sort out what we're going as, and to get them! I'll buy whatever we need, by the way, so don't worry about that. I just want to go as a group thing. You know.""We should go as pranks," Pete mused. "You know, whizzing worms, fanged frisbees, frog spawn soap—that sort of thing.""Have a load of worms on top of my head!" James laughed, slapping the table. "We could go as sweets. Chocolate frog, powdered porcupine..."They all began trying to come up with ideas except for Remus who just sleepily slathered marmalade onto some toast and on his hand, by accident. He frowned, grabbing for a napkin, then freezing when he heard them discussing possibly going as beasts. James was keen on going as a griffin, throwing out other creatures as ideas for everyone else. He didn't say 'werewolf' but he was progressively getting more into the class 4 and 5 X beasts so it wouldn't be long."What about the Muskateers?" Remus blurted out, seizing on the first thing that came into his mind which was the book he had been reading, cutting James off. "We could have fake swords!" he added, figuring that would sweeten the pot. "And fancy capes.""Aren't there only three of them?" Peter asked."There's d'Artagnan too," Remus said encouragingly."Swords would be fun," James said, rubbing his chin.Sirius leaned across the table, waggling his eyebrows as he asked Remus, "You really want to see us with swords?""Fake swords," Remus said, lifting a marmalade-covered finger.James began waving a knife around. "En garde! That's what they say, right? En garde!" He poked towards Peter who yelped and dropped a scone which plopped to the floor. "Have at ye!""Is that a Muskateer or a pirate?" Peter asked, grabbing for another scone then groaned when James skewered it with the knife, yanking it away. "Oh come on, that was mine!""Um." James shrugged then waved his knife (and Peter's scone) at Remus. "Tell us about the Muskateers!"Remus explained as best he could, going over the very basic plot lightly. Mostly describing the Muskateers themselves. It didn't take long for them to figure out who would be who. James latched immediately onto d'Artagnan which didn't surprise Remus one bit. Sirius decided he had to be Aramis, Peter chose Porthos, so Remus was Athos. Remus didn't think he'd be a very good Athos, but he doubted he'd make much of any of the others and his friends were happy with their roles, so Athos it was."I'll write to my parents and ask them to get us some good Muskateer costumes," James said, patting his pockets then making a face when he came up with nothing. Remus, who had his satchel with him, gave him some paper and ink. "I'll need your sizes.""You don't need to buy our costumes," Remus said quickly, "I'm sure we can come up with so—""No. We need this to be spectacular!" James threw his hands out. "Absolutely spectacular! I'm buying the costumes. Fake swords too, super cool fake swords. What else do we need? What would they wear exactly? Now, sizes?"/\/\/\/\/\It wasn't until later that day that Remus realized a week prior the other Marauders had snuck into Hogsmeade to get potion ingredients, but he didn't know what that was actually about. He inquired about this, a little surprised it hadn't been mentioned during the week. James admitted his fight and make up with Remus had wiped it from his mind. Apparently they wanted something Big for the Halloween feast."Fireworks won't cut it!" Sirius complained, referring to the previous year when their 'prank' was fireworks which everyone had assumed was part of the feast."What does this potion do?" Remus asked."Babbling Brew!" James said with a grin. "It takes a couple weeks to make so we thought we'd start early on.""Causes the victim to start babbling nonsense," giggled Peter. "We're gonna put it in something so it won't be too powerful. James reckons it won't last long.""Nah, it'll be so diluted anyone who takes it will only be babbling for five or ten minutes," James said, tossing a Quaffle against the wall and catching it.Remus folded his arms. "This is a potion we won't be learning for a couple years..."Sirius flung an arm around him, yanking him close. "Annnnd half the stuff we do also won't be learned for a couple years, what's your point?"Remus wriggled free, smoothing his hair down since it was stuck up everywhere from Sirius's hold. "I guess I don't really have one. I won't help, though, so—""Thank Merlin for that!" Sirius teased, prodding him in the ribs. Remus yelped, jumping away, wondering why Sirius was being such a brat today with him.James started complaining about Remus being a stick in the mud but Remus interrupted him. "What Sirius meant is precisely why I shan't be helping!" Remus flapped his hand. "If I could help, I would, however my hand would merely result in the potion being an utter failure. I'm not opposed to the prank. Actually, I imagine it will be very funny.""Oh." James looked rather sheepish. "Okay then. You can help, though, with something very important."Remus was quite confused. What could he possibly help with involving a potion? Besides just reading from the book which wasn't particularly needed in this case. "What is that?""We need a place to brew the potion," Peter said. "We're thinking about one of the secret passages but we need one that is absolutely secret, as in nobody goes in.""How can I help with that?" Remus asked."Your ghost friends probably know of areas no living being goes," Sirius said, sidling over to poke Remus again."St—stop it!" Remus glared, skittering away from him which caused him to laugh. "All right, um, I'll ask.""I'll go with you," Sirius offered.Remus narrowed his eyes. "Not if you're going to continue to poke me.""Promise I won't."Remus sighed then put his shoes on, trying to figure out which ghost would be best to ask. Probably Theodore, he decided as they left the tower. Sir Nicholas wouldn't mind helping out and had been around longer, but he wasn't too sure Sir Nicholas wouldn't tell someone once he realized they were brewing a secret potion. Possibly—His thoughts were broken as Sirius poked him again. He hopped away with a squeak, nearly tripping. "You said you wouldn't! You promised!""Whoops, it was an accident," Sirius said, brushing hair from his face.Remus glowered. "Was not! What is your problem?""Nothing." Sirius shrugged. "I'll stop."Remus continued walking, trying to keep a decent distance from Sirius. He had to pick up his pace as he realized Sirius was walking faster then he began running. "NO! STOP!" he yelled as Sirius chased him through the halls. "GO AWAY!""What's wrong, Lupin?" Sirius laughed. "Come on, then! Come here, coward!""Noooo!" he squealed, laughing as well. He turned a corner then came to a halt, seeing a teacher down the corridor. Sirius ran smack into him, nearly knocking the two of them over."Whatcha stopping f—" Sirius broke off, seeing the teacher. "Oh."Remus coughed then began walking casually, as did Sirius. They both nodded at the teacher then kept going, pattering down the stairs, going down another hallway, then turning. Remus immediately spun around, pointing at Sirius. "You poke me one more time I won't ask anyone for help," he threatened then started walking again, knowing perfectly well which ghost to ask.They chattered about various things as Remus led him down to the second floor, heading straight for the bathroom door. "Wait, why are we going in here?" Sirius asked, hesitating before following him. "Remy, I don't want to see—""Myrtle!" Remus called out cheerfully after the door swung shut."Leave me alone," Myrtle sniffled from her stall. "I want to cry.""It's Remus. I brought some company.""Why are we here?" Sirius hissed in his ear then stiffened as Myrtle appeared, glum expression fading into a happy one as soon as she saw Sirius."Why, hello again!" she giggled, flying over to float in front of him. "It's so good to see you. Not green this time."Sirius swallowed. "Yeah, uh... yeah...""Myrtle, we need some help," Remus said, stepping forward. "We need to find a place where nobody else goes.""How come?" Myrtle floated closer to Sirius, fingers brushing his shoulder; he shivered, shooting a quick glare over at Remus.Remus ignored the glare. "We need to brew a potion. Privately."Myrtle tilted her head to one side. "What sort of potion? Are you being naughty again?"Remus elbowed Sirius who gave a grunt. "Ah... yeah, uh, could you perhaps help us?" he asked through gritted teeth.Myrtle giggled, face close to Sirius's. "For you? Anything." Her fingers touched his hair then she floated back, spreading her arms. "You can use my bathroom.""Here?" Remus asked."Uh-huh. Nobody ever comes in here." She was suddenly in Sirius's face again. "You're welcome to make a potion in my toilet."Sirius reeled back, going pale. "I—I don't think toilet's really what we're g—""Thanks, Myrtle!" Remus kicked at Sirius's ankle. "We really appreciate that, and will keep it in mind. See you soon!" He grabbed Sirius's sleeve, pulling him out of the bathroom."Why did you do that?!" Sirius growled, stumbling after him. "I don't want anything to do with her!""You wanted a private spot, I can't think of anywhere more private than that," Remus said, still pulling him."I can think of a dozen! The fourth floor passage with the pits, for one. We use James's broom to get over the pits." Remus hesitated, as that would be a pretty decent place. Sirius pulled his arm free, brushing his clothes off, fixing his hair. "I don't know why we didn't think of that sooner. It would work perfectly well," he bent his head in close, hissing into Remus's ear: "and no creepy ghost girl!"Remus folded his arms. "Fine, but you tell Myrtle.""No way! I am never going back there aga—" Sirius stopped then narrowed his eyes. "Wait a minute, you took me to Myrtle on purpose, didn't you?" Remus fought back a smile, beginning to walk again, lips quirking a little at the corners. "You did!" Sirius hurried after him. "You little brat!"Remus smirked. "That's what you get for poking me."

James swore as soon as Sirius mentioned the pits passage, as they had sorta forgotten about exploring it using James's broom so immediately he grabbed his carrying case and the four of them took off, Remus a little slower behind the others as he tried to figure out the best way to get out of riding on James's broom. I can be lookout, he decided, hoping they'd accept that, doubting they would.They reached the fourth floor, the portrait complaining very loudly as they forced it aside. The portrait was still threatening them quite violently as it swung shut behind them."Lumos," all four boys chorused, their wands lighting up at various intensities, all four different colors; James's was a pure white, Sirius's had a blue undertone, Peter's more sort've grey, while Remus's was more golden. They went down the stairs, across the first pit, then reached the second. Remus knew what was on the other side however would have to pretend he didn't; of course, when he had cried in here after Dedenne's spew of hate it was all a blur so he probably didn't really remember it all that well."All right." James handed his wand to Sirius then set the case down to get his broom out. Remus swallowed, trying not to step back when the silver came into the air. "Who's first?"He flew Sirius over, then Peter, then came back for Remus who did step back. "Um, I was thinking I should stay here and be lookout?""What? No! Come on," James said, patting the broom."Um, I just think someone should stay here," he said, rubbing his arms."I know you hate flying but it's just for a couple seconds," James argued. "I won't drop you down the pit."Remus swallowed, forcing himself to look at the pit as if that were the problem and not the silver on the broom. "I can't even help with the potion anyway, so there isn't much point...""Just get on the broom, Brains," James snapped.Remus took in a deep, shaky breath, not sure if he'd be protected by the denim he was wearing. He never tried to touch silver before through cloth. He held his silver potions knife wrapped in leather but he always held it by the handle which didn't have silver in it. He had never held sickles before in cloth. So there was every chance he could get on that broom and that the silver's affect pushed through the denim and—and did whatever it did. Of course, if he was very careful he could position himself on the broom so he wasn't touching the silver..."Come on, Remus," Peter called from the other side of the pit. "It's okay, you can do it!""I—I am!" He put his leg over the broom behind James, keeping an eye on the name written along the handle, the strap of silver holding the twigs into place. He sank down, putting his arms around James, very stiff with his seat. "All right.""Merlin's beard, took you long enough." James pulled his broom up, flying swiftly across the pit, then landing. "Oh wow that was so scary!" he gasped out in a mocking sort of way, pretending to faint off the broom which dropped to the floor since Remus wasn't holding it at all."Shut up," Remus hissed, stepping quickly away from the broom while James just giggled next to it.They looked around the little area, Peter screaming when he found blood smeared inside one of the little recesses. Remus's blood. He didn't say that, of course; merely acted just as surprised and spooked. Once the area was thoroughly explored they went over the next pit, Remus taking just as long getting on the broom as before. This time the passage branched off. They chose a direction, went down a nice little hallway with a very old, dusty rug, finding a pit at the end. They backtracked and went down the other side to find it a dead end, a huge painting of a sleeping dragon. They returned to the pit and crossed over."This place is so weird!" Peter broke the silence as they went down a new corridor."What's it even for?" Sirius wondered, putting his hand against the wall where a large chunk of stone had fallen out. "What's with the pits?""Last time we were here James suggested it had been destroyed, and I agree with that theory," Remus said, crouching down by the next pit. He shone his wand light down into the darkness but didn't see anything. "The pits just don't make sense. At all. What is that spell..." He rubbed his forehead, searching his brain for the spell he had read about over the summer in passing. "There is a spell where one can cast an orb of light and leave it stuck there. Ummm..." He snapped his fingers. "Magelight! At least, that's what it's called I'm not quite sure what the actual proper spell itself is. I'll have to research that, perhaps we can throw it down one of these pits. That way we can see how far it goes down, if it's any safe, if it—""YEEEEEEHAWWW!"James suddenly did a flip above him then dove down into the pit on his broom."JAMES!" Remus screamed, jerking forward as his friend disappeared into the darkness."Merlin what an IDIOT!" Sirius said, hurrying over with Peter, both of them grabbing Remus since he was right at the edge. "JAMES!""I'm okay!" James called from the darkness. "Lumos." White light lit up several feet down, revealing James hovering. He gave them a thumbs up. "If I come up there, someone want to join me?""No!" Remus and Peter said at the same time Sirius said "Hell yeah!"James drew himself up so Sirius could climb onto the broom behind him, lighting up his wand. "I could fly one handed, but I'd rather have both hands for this just in case," James explained then saluted Remus and Peter. "Be back soon!"They descended down into the darkness. "They're idiots," Pete sighed, inching a little farther from the edge though continuing to hold on to Remus's sleeve."Extreme idiots." Remus watched them go down farther and farther. "How deep are these things?""Maybe they go all the way down to the dungeons?" Pete suggested.Remus tried to think about what was beneath them on the second floor but couldn't really put together a picture of the castle. "We really need a map," he said."Is there one?" Pete looked at him with wide eyes. "I mean, in a book in the library?""I—I don't think so. Not in any of the ones I've read at least... I can do some research."Pete snorted. "Do you ever... not do research?"Remus stuck his tongue out then looked back down. "You all right?" he called down."Dandy!" James called back up. "I think we've reached the end though. Yeah... yup, here's some floor."Remus heard scuffling as they got off the broom. He could see them standing about a floor and a half down. It seemed weird for the pit to end just there. Maybe Remus was wrong about the distance however it really did seem to end between floors."What do you see?" Pete asked."Not much," Sirius said, waving his wand around while James lit up his own. "It's just a pit."Remus resisted the urge just to jump down. "Come get us," he said."What?!" Peter looked up, face paling. Remus raised his eyebrows and Pete sighed in a resolved sort of manner. "Y-yeah, come get us..."Soon all four were down in the pit. Remus ran his wandlight along the jagged walls. "It appears as though someone literally blew a hole in the floor," he said, circling the small area. "Except the floor is far too smooth." He crouched down, running his fingers along the stone. "It's as if this is a floor... Plus... the walls aren't right. I mean, if someone blew a hole in the floor there would be... floor underneath. Like, we'd be in a hallway, or a room. Not with stone walls all around us." He went back to the wall, pressing his hand against the jagged stone that made up the sides of the pit. "Why would there just be a huge pillar? Yes, that's it. It's as if someone blew a hole down into a pillar, so everything around it is still completely stone. Or as if we were on the ground floor, and this were the foundation? But that makes no sense whatsoever for being so far up! It's almost like a... a shaft. Why would something like this even be here if—""This is boring, let's get back to exploring," James said, cutting Remus's babbling off. He didn't even wait for Remus to answer, just took Sirius back up, then Pete, then finally Remus who reluctantly went as he wanted to look around the pit some more.There were more pits though they didn't take over the entire floor so they were able to skirt around them. Down one of the pits Remus could faintly hear sounds though his friends kept going so he couldn't stop to listen in. They passed by locked doors which they decided to check out later, then came across a weird section of wall. It was definitely a secret exit, as it looked like a hole in the wall with something covering it. James pushed at the object, tugging at it as best he could, until finally it shifted. They tumbled out, finding themselves in the trophy room."I see someone's found the passage again!" a voice said behind them. They turned to look at a portrait of a man with a very wide mustache, looking down at them. "Surprised you came from that end, honestly. Gilbert Ward doesn't like intruders. Honestly, what's the point in hiding secret passages if nobody ever uses them? Not many people, of course. However once in a decade would be nice!""You're Brutus Scrimgeour!" James exclaimed excitedly."In the paint!" the portrait said. "Now, I'm not supposed to tell anyone this however since you've already found the passage, I suppose I could tell you the password to get in from my end. Beati pacifici!""Beati pacifici," Peter repeated, and the portrait slid aside. "Cool."The portrait moved back into place. "Is there a password for the other side or do we have to push him every time?" James asked."There is a password but it's not mine to give out," Scrimgeour replied, twiddling with the end of his mustache. "Now, I have places to be. Good day!" He shifted and sidled out the side of the painting."Brilliant," laughed Sirius. "Now we have another way in. We can go explore more later.""And we also know nobody uses the secret passage," Remus pointed out, "so we can use it for the potion." James clapped him on the shoulder. "So, how do you recognize Brutus Scrimgeour?" Remus inquired as they left the trophy room. "I would not have.""He wrote the Beater's Bible," James replied. "Wait, how do you know who he is?""He—he was a headmaster here," Remus said slowly, confused as to how his friend knew who the man was without knowing that. "You... didn't know?""Nope!" James shrugged. "Come on, we have to go get the carrying case from the other end of the passage. I cannot wait to explore it more, and explore more of those pits!"Remus didn't really want to admit that he wanted to do the same. He really wanted to know what happened in those passages, what caused those pits. Why did they exist? Why was it all blocked off when it looked like it was a regular corridor for the most part? When was it blocked off? He definitely needed to do some research!/\/\/\/\/\Remus dropped a pile of books on the table with a heavy thud. "All right, so I have a project I was hoping you could help with."It was Monday evening after study group, and Remus had asked Lily and Silverlocke to stay behind. Everyone else had already left so he was able to talk freely."What sort of project?" Lily asked.Remus sat down, unstacking the books so he could spread them out. They were all about Hogwarts. "I... probably shouldn't even be discussing this, they will probably murder me however I suspect this is going to be a difficult task. I would appreciate the help but do not expect it. If you do not want to, I completely understand.""Murder you?" Silverlocke raised an eyebrow. "Sounds quite dramatic."Remus smiled. "My friends can be dramatic. In any case..." He dropped his voice, leaning in so he could whisper. "We found... a secret passage.""Oooh!" Lily propped her elbow on the table, her chin in her hand, eyes sparkling. "A secret passage? What kind? Where?""I—I can't tell you," he replied with a cough. Lily frowned which immediately sent a stab of guilt through him. "Oh come on, they—they'll be angry if I do. I'll talk to them about possibly telling you... So that—I mean, because of this I'll also understand if you're not wanting to help.""What do you need help with?" Silverlocke asked, taking one of the books. "If you have already found it I am a little confused as to what you could be looking for.""Well... it's... destroyed. Sort of." Remus opened one of the books, a brief history of the school's architecture though he doubted it would reveal much. "There are all these... pits. Like someone blasted the floor apart. Something very powerful happened there, and I'm hoping to discover what.""Blasted pits into the floor?" Lily straightened up. "Is that possible to do to the castle?""Apparently so." Remus flipped through the pages, not even sure what to look for. "We need information about corridors on the third floor."Silverlocke looked rather excited as he opened his book. "Sounds fascinating. Someone destroying part of Hogwarts is quite the improbability.""I thought so too," Remus said, bending in as Lily opened another book. "I've started rereading Hogwarts, A History for the umpteenth time last night though I am sure I never read anything about destruction...""Any idea of when the destruction happened?" Lily asked then sighed when he shook his head. "Figured not.""There are loads of paintings in the corridors but none with people I can ask," Remus murmured, the pages sliding under his fingertips. "But I could possibly ask other paintings if they've been there.""Ask the ghosts as well," Silverlocke suggested."I have asked a few I can trust." He stopped when he reached some information about the third floor. "Myrtle has no idea what I'm talking about, and Theodore won't talk about it.""What about Nearly Headless Nick?" asked Lily."I—I wasn't sure about trusting him. I mean, I really like Sir Nicholas, don't get me wrong, however he is our House Ghost so I was a little worried about asking him. We're not even supposed to be in there." Remus scanned a second time through the text then, finding really nothing, moving on to the fourth floor in case there was mention about the entrance. "Honestly if anyone knows anything about it I'd think it'd be Peeves but asking him for anything is like asking to be turned into a toad.""A pink toad," Silverlocke added, eyes dancing with amusement."A pink sparkly toad," giggled Lily.They spent the next several minutes just looking through the books when suddenly Silverlocke shut his. "If there is destruction in the corridor, a likely probable cause would be a duel. Perhaps we should be doing some research into duels that have occurred here?""Professor Prewett would probably know something about that, I could ask him," Remus said, tapping his chin. "Thanks."Silverlocke smiled then opened another book. The three of them went through multiple books, taking down dozens of notes, then left about fifteen minutes before curfew. Remus thanked both of them several times before they split up, Silverlocke to the Slytherin common room, Remus and Lily to Gryffindor.When they reached the third floor, Lily stopped. "Where is it?""Where's what?""The secret passage."Remus gulped, taking a nervous step back from her. "Lily, I-I can't show you. They'd be mad."Lily shrugged, flipping some hair over one shoulder. "You always do what they say?""...no," he finally said, twisting his fingers into the bottom of his vest. He didn't want to disappoint Lily but he also didn't want to betray the other Marauders. "I just can't."She reached out, tugging at his sleeve. "Please?" She widened her lovely green eyes. "Please? I've found a few hidden passages but I'd love to see a real, proper secret one! Please? Plleeeasse?" She tugged harder at his sleeve.Remus groaned loudly and, knowing she won, Lily squealed, jumping up and down. "Come on, we have to go to the fourth floor. You cannot tell anyone about this.""I won't but why the fourth floor? You said it was the third floor.""It starts on the fourth," he explained, hurrying along since they didn't have too much time because of curfew. They arrived at the portrait of Gilbert Ward who protested furiously as Remus shoved the portrait aside. "If you'd give me the password, I wouldn't have to shove.""Rude! Children should be seen and not heard! Preferably not seen as well!"Remus and Lily climbed through the hole, Remus turning his wand on as soon as the portrait snapped back shut. They went down the steps and to the first pit which Remus showed Lily how to cross over. Then they reached the next one. "This is where it ends," he explained, holding up his wand.Lily crouched down, peering into the darkness. "I thought you said you explored it a lot? How could you have if there's a... pit? Why is there a pit?!""That's why I want to research," Remus said, crouching down as well. "Isn't it weird?""Incredibly," she agreed. "It does look like it's been blasted. Which is so bizarre! Again, though, how did you get by?"He couldn't help but smile at her. "Marauder secret.""Mmhmm." She narrowed her eyes then looked at the pit, then back at Remus. "Might the Marauder secret also be called a StarShooter?""It might," he admitted, reaching out to take her sleeve this time. "Now come on, it's nearly curfew."She followed him out quickly, the two of them going as fast as they dared to the tower. Remus kept his ears out, holding Lily back whenever they neared someone, then going back to running when they were in the clear."Have you found other passages?" she asked as they went. "My friends and I have found a few but I think they're not as secret as that one!""We've found a few," he admitted. "Mostly James and Sirius have found them." He made her slow down as they turned a corner, walking past a group of sixth year Hufflepuffs, all of whom looked down their noses at the two second years."How can you hear them?" Lily whispered when they started running again.Remus swallowed heavily. I'm being so slack again, he realized miserably. "Intuition I—I suppose," he got out, hoping that was enough of an answer."Marauder intuition?" she teased.That caused him to laugh. "Perhaps. I... I think out of the four of us I have the best. I suppose that's why they choose me to be lookout more often than not.""And you're okay being lookout?""What do you mean?"She slowed down even though there wasn't anyone else around. "I just... sometimes it worries me that—that they push you into doing things sometimes. Things you wouldn't do without them." Remus stopped walking completely and Lily looked distressed. "I'm sorry, I—""You're right," he said which surprised her. "They do push me into doing things I normally wouldn't do. In a good way. If... if I never became friends with them all I'd ever do is sit in my dorm and read or study. I wouldn't be doing things." He began tugging at the end of his sleeve, hoping he was articulating himself well enough. "But they never force me to do things I really don't want to do. I promise. If I don't want to be involved in something they're doing, they're okay with that. And I'm okay being lookout. I prefer being lookout most the time anyway."Lily studied him for a second then hugged him tightly. "All right. I just wanted to make sure they weren't... you know."Remus gave a quick hug back. "They're not. They're terrific friends. Now let's go, we really need to hurry to get back before curfew now!"They made it to the portrait at exactly eight, out of breath but in the clear.

Please report to the Storeroom 1C at exactly 4PM this afternoon (Tuesday the Third) for your detention"Mannn detention today!" James whined right as Remus read his own slip. "At least it's at four and I won't miss Quidditch practice.""Same here," Remus said, tucking his bit of paper into his bag. "Where is yours?""Storeroom 1C," James replied.Remus brightened, feeling quite pleased. "Oh good, we have detention together."James perked up as well. "Excellent! I much prefer sharing detention! Wait, what do you have detention for?""Setting Snape on fire still," Remus answered with a laugh. "At least I am assuming so. I haven't gotten any other detention since, and I've yet to do my third night. You?"James looked at his paper then threw it over his shoulder. "No damn clue!"/\/\/\/\/\At just before 4pm, James and Remus met up with Professor McGonagall at the storeroom they'd be serving their detention in. She explained they'd be cleaning up. James pulled a cross-eyed face as they went into the old, very dusty, very messy room. Most the shelves and boxes had labels and she showed them a large box for things they weren't sure where they went. There were buckets of soapy water, rags, broom, lots of cleaning supplies."I'll check up on your progress in an hour," she said then left them alone."Unnnnnnsupahvised!" James exclaimed then flopped over onto a large bag full of papers, using it like a bean bag chair. "This is gonna be a fun detention! Hey, what are you doing?""Cleaning?" Remus knelt down by a box of assorted items, going through them. "Doing what we're supposed to be doing?""Pffffft." James wriggled in deeper, crossing his legs at the ankle, putting his hands behind his head. "Nobody's watching."Remus set the items aside, organizing them by material and size. This was a Transfiguration storeroom so he assumed this was what he needed to do. The shelves were all labeled with various things like bells and vases, as well ones such as crystal and glass. He wondered where a crystal bell might go... "McGonagall will be coming back, and if we've done nothing she'll merely extend the detention. Come on, help me."James groaned loudly as he got up, shuffling over to take a bunch of candlesticks. "Where do these go?"Remus smiled at him. "Over there, where it says 'candlesticks' perhaps?" James stuck his tongue out. "That would be my guess, at least. Um, don't do that."James was trying to balance a candlestick on the end of one finger but it kept falling. He caught it twice but the third time it hit the stone floor and cracked slightly. "Whoops. Think McGonsie will notice?"Rolling his eyes, Remus got his wand out. "Reparo!" The candlestick shuddered, the crack mending. "I don't think she'll notice," he said with a grin as he put his wand away. James snorted, putting the candlesticks up. "Just try not to break anything else w—"Crash! "Oops. Um, can you fix glass?"Remus closed his eyes, feeling a headache coming on. Detention with his friend had seemed like a fun idea but it had only been a couple minutes and already he was wondering if it was possible for a twelve year old werewolf to have a heart attack."No, that's a little beyond my ability. Sweep it up.""We need tunes!" James grabbed the broom and dustpan, sweeping up the glass shards. "I'm going to sneak out and get my radio.""No, J—"But James had run out the door. Remus groaned, dropping his head in his hands; after a few deep breaths he finished sweeping up the glass, putting it in a trash bag, then returned to sorting through items. He had only gone through a couple boxes before James returned, flushed and quite giddy. He hadn't gone all the way to the Gryffindor tower. Instead he had gone to another storeroom where he knew a radio had been. He set it up, twiddling the knobs until music started playing."So, you stole it?" Remus asked as rock music drifted out."Uh-huh, another storeroom. One of Flitwick's. He's got a bunch of radios. I remembered from last year when I had a detention with him." James began bouncing to the music then jerking his arms."Are you having a seizure? Shall I call Madame Pomfrey?""What? No! I'm dancing!""We're supposed to be cleaning not danciiaaaah!" He broke off into a yell as James yanked him to his feet. "No! Come on, we need to clean!"James had a hold of Remus's hands, making his arms swing. "No, we need to dance! This song is the best! Your love is like a dragon, burning me to pieces! Flames! All around meeeeee! Burn! BURN IT UP!"Remus managed to get his hands free, stumbling back. "James, come on! Seriously, we need to do what Professor McGonagall told us to do!""Seriously, or Sirius-ly? Cause Sirius would be with me on this. Burn my soul to the GROUND!"Remus sighed, giving up, going back to organizing the objects. If James wasn't going to help then he needed to do as much as he could, not wanting to miss Occlumency, not wanting to get more detention. He began going through a box of spheres. Wooden balls, glass orbs... he frowned, trying to figure out which section to put them in."Spongify!""Wh—James, no!" Remus yelped as James spongified part of the floor so he could start bouncing. "James! This is DETENTION!" James just grinned, shrugging. "Is this what you do with Sirius in detention?""When we aren't supervised!" James laughed as he bounced up and down, holding his hands above his head to make sure he didn't hit the ceiling. "Really, you'd think the teachers would learn by now.""You'd think you'd learn by now," Remus muttered, carrying an armful of glass orbs over to the glass section, very carefully putting them up."What?"Remus turned to glare at his friend. "As I said... if McGonagall returns and finds hardly any work done most likely she'll extend our time here and you may miss Quidditch practice. And I really do not wish to miss my—... hospital appointment."James slowly stopped bouncing, the smile disappearing. "Aw, crap, you're right. Fiiiine. Only doing this under extreme protest, though, just so you know." He jammed his finger against the bridge of his glasses, pushing them up for emphasis. "And for Quidditch.""I got that, yes."James hesitated, finally getting off the bouncy spot of the floor. "Well, also for your hospital thing. I don't want you missing that."Remus smiled, a slight shiver of illness for the lie. "Thank you." He got rid of the softening spell as James came over, this time actually helping him though he complained as he did so. They went through a box together which made things a lot easier, a lot quicker. Remus eventually confessed he enjoyed having music while they did this, making James pump his fist victoriously into the air.A few minutes after that James sat back against his feet, watching as Remus stood on tiptoes to put items on the shelves. "You're taller than me, you should be doing this," Remus grumbled as he struggled to push the statues farther back. He looked over his shoulder to ask for help then stopped when he saw James staring at the far wall, very sad. Remus returned to flat feet, twisting fully around. "James?"James turned back, the sadness instantly replaced with happiness. Fake happiness? "Yeah?""You all right?""Yeah! Dandy. Why?"Remus went over, kneeling down next to him. "You seemed a little... sad.""Sad? Me?" James laughed. "Nah. I'm good. Maybe bored. You know, doing detention—actually doing it—is really boring.""Detention isn't supposed to be fun," Remus said, raising his eyebrows. "It's supposed to be a punishment.""Blah-blah-blah. You know if I were in charge detentions would be fun."Remus pressed his hands together, tucking them under his chin. "Then please tell me how you would punish students for doing wrong?""I wouldn't! Not like that!" James flapped his hand, getting to his feet so he could pace back and forth. "Who in their right mind gives detention for..." He trailed off, squinting.Remus tilted his head. "For what?""I, um, still don't know why I'm here." James sighed, sinking back down. "Let's see... could be the mice Sirius and I floated up the girls' staircases. You know, Snape probably snitched on me for yanking his robes up over his head. Would that be bad enough for detention? It wasn't bad really. Or that cushion I accidentally turned into a pig-toad—""What?!" Remus shrieked."Didn't I tell you?" James turned to him with wide eyes. "Yeah, that happened the other night while you were at study group. I accidentally turned one of the cushions in the common room into this pig-toad hybrid. I was going for toad but... it didn't go too well. Obviously.""And you got in trouble for that?" Remus asked, a little surprised. Magic in the common room wasn't really against the rules as long as it wasn't against another student, which was why James and Sirius managed to not get into too much trouble over the furniture-on-ceiling thing."Um." James fiddled with his wand, coughing. "No, I—I got into trouble for chucking it across the room and missing Peter. It sorta hit a prefect. Did I get detention for that? Or just points removed?" He tapped his chin. "Hmm. I did get detention for trying to levitate Sirius and he crashed into my cousin.""Wait—your cousin?" Remus blinked a few times. "You have a cousin here?""Distant cousin," James explained. "Professor Shafiq."Remus choked on nothing, completely taken aback. "Professor?! You have a cousin who is a professor?! How did you not inform us of this?"James groaned. "Distant cousin! Plus she's only a substitute teacher. The Indian witch with the headscarf? She's my mum's second cousin, sooooo... my third cousin? I think? Before school I only ever saw her at family events. I don't really know her. Anyway, I got detention for that so maybe that's why I'm here.""It sounds like it was an accident, though," Remus muttered, still a little bitter that James had never once mentioned one of his relatives taught at the school—substitute or not! If he had a relative around, he would have told them. Then again, he didn't know any of his relatives. Actually there was the possibility he had a distant cousin around somewhere. He knew his father was an only child however his grandfather had had siblings. What if I have a cousin around Hogwarts somewhere? he wondered, trying to remember anything about his grandfather's family. He didn't know much. Just that he had agreed for his son to be sent to Beauxbatons.He sorta wished that he did know more. That he knew his family. It's my fault I don't, that I can't. Remus bit his lip, heart sinking, regret filling his body for even coming down this path. Because of me, mum and dad had to cut everyone else out of their lives..."It was an accident!" James said, shaking Remus out of his thoughts. "I think it would have been all right but I did kinda... laugh." It took Remus a second to even remember what they had been talking about. James throwing Sirius into a teacher. "A lot. Or maybe it was the fireworks I let off in the kitchens—""James, when the heck are all these things happening?!" Remus demanded. "How come I don't know about most of this?"James just shrugged, adjusting his glasses. "Most of these have happened while you're at study group. That's why."Now Remus groaned, pressing one hand against his face. "Okay. Well, um, when I go to study group is that just some sort of signal for a Marauder free for all?"James perked up. "Yeah, pretty much. You are the voice of reason in our group. Without you, we're feral. Is that the right word use? Anyway, none of that really deserves detention. That's the point I'm trying to make. I mean come on. Would you give detention for what I've done?"Remus pulled a box over to go through it, trying his hardest not to laugh. "Possibly.""Oooh, you're mean.""James you—you threw a pig-toad at a prefect!""Accidentally!" James whined. "Pete was supposed to catch it! If anyone got detention for that it should be him! Not me. S'not fair."Remus shook his head, then began to chuckle. "It truly amazes me how much detention you get."James beamed. "Thank you!" He rested his hand over his heart. "It's a point of pride and honor. Really, you should be getting more detention too, Remy! You're a Marauder! It's... what we do.""I get more than enough, thank you." He stood up, putting lanterns onto the shelf with the label metal work then hesitated, looking over at light sources. "Errrr... hmm..."James went quiet for a moment. Then finally in a rather worried voice asked. "Does it bother you, that we do? That we... get into trouble? Our pranks?"Remus decided metal work would be the best choice and arranged the lanterns carefully. "A couple months I turned the entire entrance hall into a giant trampoline." He smiled over his shoulder. "I don't mind pranks. I like pulling them. I do like causing trouble. It..." It gave him a thrill. It helped make him feel normal, though he'd never tell them that. He knew he shouldn't, knew how horrible it was for him to do these things after everything Professor Dumbledore had done to him. Flaunting the rules, causing troubles. It was wrong.But boy was it fun and felt so good!"It what?" James inquired.Remus hummed quietly, fingers brushing against the metal as he backed away from the lanterns. "It's the being caught part that is less than satisfactory.""Getting caught means people know you did it!" James said, folding his arms. "They know what you're capable of!""I'm fairly sure by now the entire school is well aware of what you are capable of, James Potter." Remus returned to the box, kneeling next to James, looking at him. "In all honestly, though, I do rather admire your remarkable talent for causing trouble."James grabbed Remus's shoulders. "Good, because I have a brilliant idea for one involving a bucket of slugs, and Snape.""Oh, Merlin."/\/\/\/\/\Wednesday morning they went into Charms laughing and joking, Sirius telling a particularly vulgar joke that made them snort with embarrassed laughter as they took their seats.Professor Flitwick waited until everyone was in their seats then he waved his wand towards a large boulder that was sitting in a corner. It lifted up into the air, then dropped. Several students gasped in fear as it hurtled down... then it bounced right back up, bouncing several times before settling."Can anyone tell me what—" Flitwick began but four hands shot up. He looked over at the Marauders, giving a small sigh. "Why am I not surprised? Very well then, Mr. Pettigrew, I'll have you answer.""Spongify!" Peter exclaimed happily."Correct. Two points to Gryffindor..." Flitwick then lectured a bit about the history, what the spell did, what the spell actually was along with the wand movements, then handed out rocks to everyone. Pretty much right off the bat four rocks went bouncing all over the room causing shrieks from the other students. Flitwick gave the Marauders a look as all four of them were grinning, watching their rocks going everywhere. "It seems that we have four masters of the softening spell," he said, and the rest of the class tittered. Remus flushed slightly but James and Sirius looked quite proud. "Very well. Since you four have such a terrific grasp of this particular spell and it seems this lesson is not going to be much of help to your education..." Flitwick paused for dramatic effect, Remus knowing his friends were expecting to be dismissed for the rest of class by the fact all three of their faces fell when Flitwick finished with, "I'll just give you a quiz on the spell." He tapped some parchment then sent the papers flying over."I'll help you," Remus whispered since he knew they knew nothing about the spell, and they weren't being given anti-cheat quills."Thank Merlin," James whispered back, relieved.But as soon as they had the parchment in their hands Flitwick added, "Miss Magpie, would you mind switching seats with Mr. Lupin?"Remus froze, then glanced at the others who looked even more miserable now. There wasn't anything he could really do except grab his bag, the scroll with the questions on them, and switch with Magpie who had been sitting clear on the opposite side of the room. He slumped down in his seat, casting more glances over at the Marauders, giving them a sheepish shrug.Veronica McNab leaned towards him to whisper, "Shame you can't help your friends cheat, huh?" Then she went back to working on her rock. Remus felt a stab of petty joy when her rock remained stony.Remus began answering the questions which were mostly easy... for him. He knew the others wouldn't be able to answer. Hopefully this was just to keep them occupied and Flitwick wouldn't actually grade them. Then a bouncy rock came to a rest near his feet. He was going to ignore it then realized some paper was wrapped around it. He picked it up, peeling the paper off. It was from Sirius, begging for help. He looked at Sirius who was nodding at him.Remus eyed Flitwick who was helping Nettle with her wand movement then quickly scribbled a few answers down. Not all of them, just a couple of the easier ones, and some of the harder ones, and maybe a few in-between ones. He re-stuck the parchment, re-spongified, then sent it over. Unfortunately he was a much worse aim and it careened in the wrong direction, smacking into Struthers who took the paper off. He read everything on it then looked at the Marauders. James was banging his head against his desk, Sirius had his arms folded angrily, Peter's eyes were huge, and Remus began chewing at his nails.Struthers looked at Flitwick. All he had to do was hand it over and Remus would be in so much trouble. Probably the worst trouble he'd ever been in, worse than setting Snape on fire. Possibly. He was cheating. He was helping his friends cheat. All right, so he had done it plenty of times before for minor things like this—whispering out answers, helping with homework—but this was... evidence. It wasn't a real test though! Did it matter? His stomach began hurting really bad.Struthers looked back at Remus who gave him a desperate, pleading look. He knew if Spinnet had gotten the rock it'd all be over but Struthers was a little nicer. Hopefully a lot nicer.Flitwick.The other Marauders.Then he tossed the rock towards the other Marauders. He caught Remus's gaze and rolled his eyes, smiling slightly as he shook his head, going back to his own work./\/\/\/\/\After Transfiguration Professor McGonagall asked Remus to stay behind. Immediately the other Marauders made 'ooooh' sounds, joking that he was in trouble. They left the room though Remus knew they were right on the other side. Remus grabbed his bag, going to the front of the room, wondering what McGonagall needed, terrified she had found out somehow he had helped his friends cheat in Charms earlier.She motioned for him to sit down which he did, anxious about what he had done. Before he could ask McGonagall said, "I was wondering how your Defense Against the Dark Arts classes are going."Whatever he had expected it certainly wasn't that. "Um..." He shifted in his seat, insides all swoopy from confusion now instead of just anxiety. "I—I think they're going all right? I'm getting good grades."The corner McGonagall's lip twitched just slightly though it didn't continue into a smile. "That is good to hear. However, I was more meaning how things with Professor Prewett are going.""P... Prewett?" Another second of confusion then he realized what she meant. "Oh! Oh! Um, y—yes. I think so. He—he seems nice, he hasn't acted like Professor Dedenne yet. Is that what you mean?""It is," she said, now frowning. "What do you mean 'yet'? Do you suspect he might?"Remus bowed his head, fingers twisting into the hem of his vest. "I don't know. I mean, it—he... he's nice.""Is there a problem?" she probed and he remained silent. "Mr. Lupin. After what happened with Professor Dedenne, I really hope you feel you can talk to me."He shrank back in his seat. "No. There isn't a problem. I just mean 'yet' because—well, I mean..." His fingers twisted even more into the wool, some of it very tight, cutting off blood circulation to the tip of his right forefinger. "He's nice.""Mr. Lupin," she warned.He regretted even saying anything. He should have just said everything was fine. "I'm a werewolf. So... most people don't like me. I just figure there's always the possibility of—of his opinion changing."McGonagall sat back, folding her hands together. "I see. Mr. Lupin, I know you are a werewolf and I like you. You are a brilliant young wizard, with immense talent. I am proud to call you one of my students. Do you believe my opinion will change?"His nose began itching as tears threatened to spill over from her words. He managed to hold them back, thankfully. "N-no ma'am," he managed to squeak out. He knew he shouldn't truly trust her, but he did. His parents, of course, he understood most of their love for him (though he still was in awe they gave up everything for him, he felt as though he didn't deserve it), and Miss Fawley—she had her own experiences. However, McGonagall was like Dumbledore. They were solid fixtures who, for some reason, cared about him despite his monster status; something he didn't understand but finally accepted."I understand your worries," McGonagall said gently. "What happened with your previous teacher was terrible. It makes sense for you to have these fears. I am very glad to hear Professor Prewett is treating you well. He is a good person so I expected as much, however I wanted to make sure. Please come talk to me if any issues arise.""Yes ma'am."He left the classroom, running headfirst into James. "Everything okay?" Sirius asked as they untangled from each other."Yeah, it's fine," he said, straightening up."Not your mum?" Pete asked.Remus shouldered his bag, trying not to smile at the concern in his friend's voice. "No, thankfully not. I think if my mother were very ill, she would have told me before class."Pete screwed his face up. "Ooh, right. Well, I'm glad everything's okay. Are we going ahead with our prank tonight?""Are we doing that tonight?" Remus asked, frowning. "I thought we were doing it tomorrow night. I have study group tonight.""I have Quidditch practice tomorrow," James pointed out, and Remus made a face having completely forgotten that. "We can do it after study group tonight...""Except we might not be able to find Snivellus after study group," Remus said.Sirius groaned. "Can't you be like, ten minutes late to study group? Or not go?""I—I suppose I don't need to go however I would much rather not miss it. Or be late. I'm only going three nights a week. Can't we do it another night?""I have Quidditch practices," James said huffily."Can't we do it now?" Peter inquired. "If we can find him, I mean."Sirius shook his head. "We don't have the slugs ready."Remus grabbed James's arm, looking at his watch. "We can get them done before supper, and ambush Snape on the way to the Great Hall. Anyone opposed to that?"They all shook their heads then hurried to their dorm to begin Operation Slimy Snivellus.

The Marauders had less than an hour to get everything ready for Operation Slimy Snivellus which gave them hopefully enough time but they didn't want to waste a single minute. The second they got to their dorm Peter dove for the the bucket of rocks he had been hiding under his bed. He dumped them all out onto the floor then they all sat down, turning the rocks into super slimy horned slugs, a spell Remus had cobbled together. There was a spell for turning something into a horned slug but not this slimy so he had tinkered with it quite a bit to get what they wanted, and boy were they slimy. Remus kept wiping his hands off on towels but he got covered in the slime. The others seemed more entertained by the slime than he did, flicking globs at each other."We are going to need showers," said Remus after he dropped the last horned slug into the bucket.Sirius wriggled his slime covered fingers at Remus. "Give you a galleon to taste it.""EW!" Peter yelled while Remus covered his mouth, making gagging sounds."I'll do it!" James said then licked his hand without even waiting for confirmation, while all the other Marauders cried out in disgust. "Oh Merlin's beard that's disgusting!" he groaned. He began gagging as he scrambled to his feet, running to the bathroom. Remus heard vomiting sounds.Sirius laughed. "Guess I owe him a galleon.""I cant believe he actually licked this," Peter said, pressing his thumb and forefinger together then pulling them apart to watch the sticky slime stretch out.James staggered back in. "That was disgusting!""What did it taste like?" Sirius asked.James smacked his lips a couple times. "It tasted like disgusting.""That doesn't make sense," Peter said."Yeah, was it sour?" Sirius asked.James shrugged. "I dunno, it tasted like if disgusting was a taste, then that would be it."Remus looked at the slime on his hand then gave it a delicate sniff. "Give you a galleon to taste it and actually tell me what it tastes like," Sirius said. Remus rolled his eyes at him."I'll give you mine too," James said.Remus raised his eyebrows. Two galleons? For throwing up? Hmm. He sniffed the slime again then licked his hand before he could think about what a terrible idea this was. "Oh Merlin!" he cried out, hand automatically going to cover his mouth which just made it worse. James nodded emphatically while Remus ran to the bathroom, crashing into one of the stalls, managing to shove the lid up before vomiting. Once he finished he washed his hands thoroughly, cleaned his face off, and rinsed his mouth out before returning to the dorm, rather pale and shaky."What's it taste like?" Peter asked."It tastes... like..." Remus slid down to the ground, rubbing his face. "Disgusting."Sirius and Peter both groaned while James snapped his fingers. "Yeah, see? It tastes as if someone turned disgusting into a taste!" James said to which Remus adamantly agreed with."You're smart, you can describe it better than that!" Sirius complained."I—I really can't," Remus protested weakly. "I suppose the closest thing would be the earthworm bean. Only worse. And... stickier. And grosser. Galleons, please."Sirius looked at Peter who shook his head vigorously. "Nope, don't even think about asking. Not even for ten galleons, buddy."Sirius had to clean his hands off first before fetching the two galleons, while James got a paper and quill. "I'm gonna write to Bertie Bott's," he explained when Remus asked what he was doing. "Horned slug slime flavored bean. Now that's a winner! Come on now lads, we really need showers then we can go hunt Snivvy down!"After all four slime-covered Marauders took showers (and Remus hid his two galleons in his trunk) they gathered the bucket of slugs as well as James's invisibility cloak, folded and tucked into James's pocket. Remus had a pretty awful stomachache because of the plan, grumbling the entire way down towards the Great Hall until Sirius told him to shut it. Once they got nearer to the Great Hall Remus went under the cloak. It felt super weird being under it by himself. He barely even went under it even with the others. It was way too big for just him and since he held the bucket in one hand that made it more difficult to shuffle along, leaving the other three outside the Great Hall where they hung out, being very much seen by loads of students.Remus got near the dungeons then set the bucket down, backing away so he could levitate it once the halls were clear. He pressed himself back into a nook, waiting. He was voted as the most innocent (three to one) plus the one they could easily give an excuse as to where he was (studying in the dorm room). Therefore, he'd be the culprit. If Snape was in his common room and not somewhere else. Be very helpful if we had something that told us where he was! Remus thought as he waited impatiently.A couple older Slytherins passed by, then a handful of first years (none of them Regulus), then some of the second year girls. Finally there was Snape, reading while he walked which sent a slight pang through Remus at the familiarity of it. He hoped he would time it well. He waited another few seconds then tipped the bucket upside down. It was perfect timing. The slugs and slime dumped over Snape's head pretty much right on target, splattering everywhere. Remus felt slightly guilty seeing slime getting all over the open book. Remus whispered another spell, sending the bucket floating down the corridor, around a corner where it couldn't be seen.Snape shook some of the slime off then turned around, mouth slightly open in shock as he searched the corridors, slime clinging to his hair. Remus held his breath as those black eyes roved over him but he was completely invisible. Snape kept slowly turning in a circle, then flushing slightly as some other Slytherins stopped in the hallway behind him, laughing at him."Potter. Black. I KNOW YOU'RE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE!" Snape roared, shaking more slime off. The slugs were piled at his feet (except for a couple on his shoulders, one in his hair). The other Slytherins squealed, reeling back from the flying goop. "WHERE ARE YOU?!""Paranoid much, Snape?" sneered one of the Slytherins, delicately stepping around him. "Nobody's here.""THEY ARE BEHIND THIS!" Snape yelled, fingers twitching. "They are behind EVERYTHING!" He yanked his wand out, spinning in a circle again. "Flipendo!" He started shooting the Knockback jinx in random directions. Remus sucked in some air, pressing even harder into the corner of the recess. "Flipendo!" The spell nearly hit one of the other Slytherins. "WHERE ARE YOU?!""SNAPE!" A Slytherin prefect stormed into view. "Expelliarmus!" Snape's wand went flying. "Are you out of your mind!?" The prefect grabbed the fallen wand, pressing it back into Snape's hand. Snape just breathed heavily, slime dripping off his nose. "I have to take ten points from Slytherin for this. Attacking other Slytherins.""I was trying to attack Potter and Black!" Snape hissed out.The prefect glanced around and again Remus froze up when her eyes swept over where he was hidden. "I don't see them. Has anyone seen them? Has anyone seen Potter or Black?""Potter and Black?" Silverlocke appeared from the other end of the corridor, holding books in his arms. "They have been mucking about in front of the Great Hall with Pettigrew for the last fifteen minutes, tripping people.""Loopy, then it was Lupin!" Snape snarled.Remus covered his mouth, trying not to laugh."Don't call him that!" Silverlocke snapped, cheeks tinting a little. Remus gave a small smile. Silverlocke was defending him when he 'wasn't around', and it felt so good.Snape glared back. "He is a complete cracked cauldron."Silverlocke jerked forward, books slipping as one of his hands went down to his pocket where he kept his wand. Then he must have realized they were most certainly not alone and a prefect was watching. He sniffled slightly, returning his hand to holding the books. Snape gave a slight smirk."Really, Snape, don't be ridiculous," the prefect sighed, turning her attention back to Snape now that it was clear Silverlocke wasn't going to attack him. "Loop—er, Lupin's no where around here either. Go and get cleaned up." Snape shook his hands once more then slowly began walking back into the dungeons. "Filch is going to be very unhappy," the prefect said, toeing one of the slugs. "I'm not cleaning this up. All right, move along everyone!" She clapped her hands and the crowd dispersed.Remus waited a few minutes then hurried out, going to the second floor bathroom where he knew he'd have privacy. He heard Myrtle crying in one of the stalls so he was able to take the cloak off without her noticing (and waylaying him). He tucked the cloak into his bag then left again, casually going to the Great Hall.The other Marauders were still outside the Great Hall, jumping to their feet as soon as they saw him. "How'd it go? We heard a commotion," Sirius said, grabbing for Remus's arm immediately."Perfect!" Remus laughed, then dropped his voice so he could tell them what happened. All three of them screamed with laughter, especially over the fact he had shot curses everywhere—including at his fellow Slytherins! They all agreed how paranoid Snape was being, or at least the other three agreed; frankly Remus didn't really blame Snape. If something happened to him, 99% of the time it was one of the Marauders. He felt a little bad for that although considering all the awful things Snape had done and said about Remus, it was only a very little bit of guilt.They were still talking about it when Professor McGonagall approached them, her lips pressed into a thin line of disapproval. "Hello," she said, stopping in front of them. They all gave their best innocent faces. "I've just spoken with Miss Thornwind.""Dunno who that is," James said, straightening up."A Slytherin prefect," she explained. "She wanted to inform me there was an incident involving a Slytherin, and that you two were accused as being the aggressors.""When did it happen?" Sirius asked."About ten minutes ago."Sirius, James, and Peter exchanged looks. "We've been out here for over half an hour, Professor," James explained sweetly. "Ask anyone who has come by.""All four of you?" she demanded."Remus was in the dorm room until a few minutes ago," Sirius said, hand dropping onto Remus's shoulder. "Probably studying. Cause he's boring.""Hey!" Remus snapped. "Studying is important. Not boring. Honestly, if you spent half as much time actually, properly studying as you do finding ways to—""If I spent half as much time studying as I do anything it'd still be too much studying and I'd die of boredom. You want to kill me." He turned to McGonagall. "Professor, Remus is trying to assassinate me.""Forgive me if I don't send my condolences," she said flatly. Remus snickered. "I didn't think any of you were involved, and neither did Miss Thornwind. I did have to ask." She nodded at them then swept past into the Great Hall.James and Sirius began poking each other in victory over getting away with it while Peter clapped Remus on the back, congratulating him. He tried to imitate Snape's face after the slugs hit which caused his friends to laugh once more before they went in to supper./\/\/\/\/\Silverlocke brought up the slugs at study group which caused Lily to physically react, her gaze immediately going to Remus. He told her honestly that James and Sirius (as well as Peter) had been busy causing trouble outside the Great Hall when Snape had been attacked. McGonagall confirmed this, and even a Slytherin prefect had told Professor McGonagall she doubted the Marauders were involved.Then, shortly after, an argument broke out. It started when they began discussing their Charms homework and Twycross brought the whole thing up about what happened in their class. Not the fact Remus had cheated since she didn't know, but the fact Flitwick had separated him from his friends to 'prevent' the cheating. She said this all in a rather haughty tone, rolling her eyes, and tossing her hair back. She finished with, "No wonder they pass their classes since nobody else has ever separated them!""Remus doesn't cheat," Lily said immediately."Oh, I'm sure," she said airily.Remus wasn't sure what to say since he had, indeed, technically speaking, cheated today. It wasn't like they were probably even going to be graded on the test though! It had just been a lighthearted quiz that Flitwick wanted to use to poke a little at James and Sirius, right?"Considering the fact we are given anti-cheating quills it is very impressive if what you're saying is true," Silverlocke said, cocking an eyebrow towards Remus, an amused smirk on his face. "I had no idea you and your friends were so powerful! Very impressive."Twycross went brilliantly pink while Lily began snickering. "Th—that isn't what I meant!" Twycross snapped."What did—did you m-mean, then?" Remus asked sweetly."I meant—well, you obviously help them with their homework!"Remus shrugged. "I give th—them some advice, yes, but I don't do their ho—homework for them." Not completely. Sorta. Mostly. Okay, kinda. "If I did you'd th-think a teacher would have noticed by now. Unless..." he widened his eyes innocently, "you think the—the teachers are so oblivious?"Twycross went even redder. "You aren't getting what I am meaning! You're purposely being obtuse! Do you know what that even means?"Now she had everyone staring at her. "Dude, Lupin's like a walking dictionary," Bones said. "Makes it pretty obvious you're just insulting him now on purpose.""I wasn't!" Twycross sucked in some air then began gathering her things. "Fine. I'll just leave if that's what you want!""We don't want you to leave," Buckling said though rather halfheartedly. "Just stop insulting Lupin. He's the smartest one here.""Oh yes!" Twycross's voice was high pitched now. "Saint Lupin the Genius!""Twycross, can it," Pierce grumbled.Twycross's nostrils flared. "This is ridiculous.""You're ridiculous," Bones muttered.Then all hell broke loose. Twycross started talking rapidly about how unfair everything was, and how nobody ever cared about her. Soon everyone except for Remus and Silverlocke were arguing loudly, and Mr. Farrow kicked them out of the library, telling them if they kept this up he wouldn't allow their study group to meet there anymore.On the way to the tower (Twycross storming far ahead of them) Remus assumed Lily would laugh about the argument but instead, after a few moments, she asked about what happened with Snape. About where the Marauders were when that happened."I promise, they were by the Great Hall," he said."Where were you?" she inquired."M—me?" he asked which made her narrow her eyes. "I was in my dorm still. I came down about ten minutes after they did, finishing up an essay."Lily sighed heavily. "Who dumped slugs on him then?""I couldn't guess." He couldn't guess because he already knew so it wasn't technically a lie, right? He had lied either way just before, so he supposed it didn't really matter. It just... felt icky to lie too much to Lily. She was too sweet and kind to lie to. Ugh, guilt! "Of course he's going to blame it on us."They got to the tower and Remus immediately went to the dorm. He slowed as he got to the door, hearing his friends talking."—nna tell Peter about it?" James was asking."Not until it happens, I think that would be the safest way to explain to—" Sirius was saying as Remus opened the door. They both went silent, looking a touch anxious at the sight of him. "Remus!" Sirius's voice cracked a little bit. "You're here early."That aroused his suspicion. "Yeah, there was... an argument. What's going on?" He looked between them, the hairs on the back of his neck prickling a little."Nothing," they both said in unison.Remus frowned as he put his bag on his bed. "Obviously something. Telling Peter what?"The two of them glanced at one another. "A prank," Sirius finally said brightly. Too brightly. "Jimmy and I are planning a big prank.""What prank?""What?"Remus folded his arms, looking down his nose at them. They looked so guilty that it sent off alarms in Remus's head. What had they been talking about? "What's the prank?" he repeated."Monkeys!" James blurted out."Monkeys," Remus repeated slowly and both boys nodded vigorously. "What about monkeys?""We, er, want to learn how to turn something into monkeys," Sirius said in the same voice he used with the teachers when he was trying to weasel his way out of trouble, giving excuses and fake alibis. "Set them loose in Snape's dorm.""Imagine him coming back and finding monkeys all over his bed!" James began laughing, a genuine laugh. "That's actually a pretty brilliant prank!" Sirius elbowed him. "Er, I mean, of course it's a brilliant prank that we thought of... earlier tonight. Because of the slugs!""Riiight." Remus sat down, untying his shoes slowly. He debated whether or not to continue pushing about this. He was aching to know what was really going on. They seemed to be planning on telling Peter down the line. Did that mean they were going to tell Remus too? Or was it some big Marauder secret they'd keep from him? Sure, he was keeping something from them (loads of things) but that was different. It wasn't three against one. And he didn't make it obvious, or tried not to. He pulled off his first shoe then worked on the next one. "Why don't you want to tell Peter yet?""What?" James asked. Remus just rolled his eyes at him, not wanting to repeat himself again."Ooh, you know Peter," Sirius said dismissively, waving his hand.Remus yanked off his other shoe, waiting for more which didn't come. "Yes, I know him. I know that he's up for most pranks.""He—he's afraid of monkeys," Sirius said quickly."Yes!" James said, snapping his fingers. "He is. That's why we're going to wait, so he doesn't, you know, get all freaked out."Remus regretted taking off his shoes because he just wanted to get away from them. He was hurting more now, at the fact they were doing this. Keeping him out of the loop. He knew there wasn't any monkey prank, it was something else. "Transfiguring objects into monkeys seems a little advanced, do you already have a spell?""No," Sirius said then grinned. "Wanna do some research?"Remus stared at him. "No," he said simply and both their faces fell. "You can do it yourself." He put slippers on as he grabbed his shower things, figuring that would be a good excuse to get away from them. The wolf was pacing from the anger rising inside of him. He ignored their expressions, hurting too much to care he had hurt them. His nose itched as he held back the tears."Remus—" Sirius started but Remus left, slamming the door shut behind him harder than he meant to. He really didn't want them knowing how much he was upset. He heard his name again which he ignored, storming into the bathroom, diving for a stall in case they followed him in. He shut the curtains, stripping off, throwing his clothes on the little seat then stomping into the shower section, turning the hot water on.He smacked his hand against the wall then slumped back, rubbing his forehead. If they wanted to keep a secret from him that was one thing. It didn't bother him. He knew perfectly well by this point James and Sirius were essentially one person in two bodies; they had plenty of secrets between the two of them, that was fine. The fact they were so nervous about it and lying was what bothered him. It was something they realllyyy wanted to keep from him. Something they planned on telling Peter and not him.Remus sank down to the floor, smacking the back of his head against the wall before taking in a few deep gulps of air. It doesn't matter, he told himself. They're free to have their own secrets. It doesn't mean they dislike you.Despite telling himself this, he didn't quite believe it.After his shower he disappeared into his bed, feigning exhaustion when his friends questioned him. When Peter came back from Photography Club he also tried to get Remus to come out to play cards but Remus didn't want to deal with James or Sirius. He repeated that he was just really tired. He could see the vague concern on James and Sirius's faces though Peter accepted his lies. Remus wondered how Peter would have reacted, if the situation had been different, if he had come in to hear them saying something about telling Remus and not Peter; he figured Pete wouldn't care. I shouldn't care, he thought miserably, hating himself for feeling this way.He spent the evening working on Defense Against the Dark Arts essays, more of the special ones Prewett gave him, or at least trying to. He was too distracted to properly focus on them as well as he would have liked so finally he just set it aside, reaching instead for a light fictional story to delve into. He was able to block everything out for a while, fighting off sleep until he really was too tired, but when he tried to go to sleep it didn't work. He tossed and turned, wondering what they were keeping from him. Why they were keeping something from him but not Peter (eventually).He had nightmares that night. Of them whispering to one another while looking pointedly at Remus, and then someone dumped liquid silver on him while they laughed. He woke up with a cry of fear then shoved his fist into his mouth, praying, then letting out a slight groan as he heard Sirius stirring. Just stay in bed, don't come over, don't..."Remus?"The curtains parted, Sirius's pale face peeking in."I'm okay," Remus whispered. "It w-wasn't so bad this time." Sirius looked at his face then pushed the curtains back a bit more so he could get onto Remus's bed. "N—no, really, I'm fine.""You seem upset," Sirius said softly, shutting the curtains so they wouldn't bother anyone else.Remus tried not to snap at him. "I'm tired is all. Not—not feeling great. Please, I really just want to go back to sleep.""Are you upset about—""I'm not upset," he interrupted quickly. "Just tired. Please."Sirius frowned then Remus reached over, tugging the curtain aside to indicate for Sirius to go. He had never done anything like that before and saw the hurt filling Sirius's face. "All right," he replied and slid out of the bed. "Goodnight then," he added a little frostily.He felt bad, but only a little. "Goodnight."Remus waited until he heard Sirius settled in his bed before laying back down, hand reaching for Gwyllgi. Just get over it, he told himself, squeezing his eyes shut. It doesn't matter if you're being left out.But Merlin, it still hurt.

You're keeping secrets from them, it's not wrong for them to keep something from you, Remus told himself when morning came, rubbing his eyes which had very dark circles underneath since he had barely slept. James and Sirius were both very chirpy, clearly being overly nice to Remus as the four of them went down to breakfast which just rubbed him the wrong way even more. They knew he was upset over what happened and were trying to 'fix' it. Remus tried to pretend to be fine but by the time they headed towards their first class he was already done with the day, done with his friends.He knew he shouldn't feel this way, that everyone was entitled to their secrets. But thinking that and feeling that were two different things and he couldn't stop. It sat like a lump inside his stomach, it hurt to feel so left out. He wondered why. Why him? What was going on that they decided he didn't need to know, didn't deserve to know? At least their first class was Herbology so it gave him something to do with his hands, moving plants from one pot to another, carefully pruning some plants back, trying not to listen to their goofy chatter. They tried to include him in on the conversation but he just ignored them, focusing on the plants."Are you mad at us?" Peter asked as soon as they left the greenhouse. He had no idea what was going on, but easily picked up on Remus's vibes which made him feel even worse that Peter got swept up in his irritation. Peter had nothing to do with it, but he couldn't really explain that in front of the others."No," Remus lied, wiping sweat and dirt from his forehead. He knew he should just talk to James and Sirius. That would be the best course. Instead he felt burning inside of him, the lump feeling heavier as they headed into the castle. He couldn't stand it another minute. Remus cleared his throat and said, "I—I think I'm just going to head to the library to finish up the essay I need to turn into Professor Prewett."Sirius tilted his head. "Don't you finish up your essays pretty much the day we get them? Or are you just trying to avoid us?"Remus stiffened a little, avoiding Sirius's eyes. "I want to alter a few paragraphs," he replied, pretending he hadn't heard the second part of the question. "I'll catch up with you at lunch." He hurried down the corridor then turned a corner, leaning against the wall to take a deep breath. He could still hear them clearly, Peter wanting to know what the heck was going on, James and Sirius flat out telling him that Remus had discovered that they were keeping a secret."A secret?" Pete asked. "What kind?""We'll tell you later," Sirius said grouchily."He's mad at you for keeping a secret from us?" Pete asked, sounding bewildered."Yeah," sighed James. Then James said something else but Remus couldn't quite pick it up as a group of much older students came down the hallway, talking loudly. Remus slid past them, heading first to a bathroom to wash his shaking hands. He washed them multiple times, staring rather blankly at his reflection. He kept hearing Peter's last question, how stupid it made it all seem. How stupid it should be. He pulled back from the sink with a whiny sort of moan then went to the library, hoping to try to wipe all of this away from his brain for at least a little while.He settled down at a table near the back with a few books, his essay, clean parchment, and a buzzy sort of mind. He carefully copied out the first half of the essay then began rewriting the second bit, adding in a few new descriptions and theories. Finally he set his quill down, dropping his head in his hands. He had already had a nasty fight with James he really didn't want to start fighting again, and not with Sirius as well. He needed to get over this. Get over the stupid, stupid, pointless, injury that he shouldn't even feel!"It doesn't matter," he told himself, voice muffled behind his hands. "Just forget about it. It doesn't matter.""What doesn't matter?"Remus gasped out, jumping in his seat then frowning deeply as Sirius slid into the seat next to him. "N-nothing," he got out, grabbing for his quill. "A—a—just a bit in my essay I don't feel adds to the—er—overall... um..."Sirius had his elbow on the table, chin propped against his fist. He was nodding slowly as Remus spoke and when he fell silent Sirius began speaking. "Overall what?" Remus just shrugged, ducking his head down, writing some more. "Uh-huh. It had nothing to do with what happened last night?"Remus watched the inked letters forming on the parchment as he wrote, heart pounding in his chest. "What happened last night?" he asked lightly.Sirius snorted. "Don't give me that, Remus Lupin. You're bloody well mad at us."Remus sniffled slightly, dipping his quill in some ink. "I'm not angry, if that's what you think."Sirius's hand darted out, grabbing Remus's wrist, sending a slight shock through his body. "It is what I think, and it's what you are.""Don't tell me what I am or am not!" Remus snapped, jerking his arm free. Ink spots splattered across his essay and he hissed out. "Look what you made me do!" He tried first siphoning off the ink which didn't work too well, then tried the smudge clearing spell he recently read about. The ink smeared even more. He gave a disgusted sound, pushing the parchment away and grabbing a new one to start over.Sirius took the damaged one. "You're way too smart, Brains; you know that, right? Like, you're super smart."Remus groaned, bending in close to the table as he began rewriting the essay yet again. This was safer ground than discussing how he felt. "I'm not doing your homework.""I'm not asking you to do my homework!" Sirius shook his head, setting the parchment down. "Though I probably should have asked for some help the other day. Think Prewett'll give me an extension?"Remus blinked. "You—you haven't done the essay which is due today?"Sirius narrowed his eyes, making a popping sound with his lips. "Define 'done'."Remus's head smacked against the table. "Merlin, Sirius, you've had a—a-a week! It's—it's only ten inches long! How can you not do ten inches in a week?!"Sirius spread his hands out, face opening with a huge grin. "It's called... laziness!" He flung out his arms in a dramatic manner. "It's also called I really don't give a flying jarvey about the essay. It's also called we need to talk about last night. By the way, you've got ink all over your face."Remus's hands flew to his cheek then he withdrew them, seeing ink which must have gotten on him when he slammed his face down from Sirius's stupidity. "Bollocks." He got a handkerchief out of his bag, wiping as best he could, probably just making his face worse. "We don't need to talk about last night—""Don't be stupid. Course we do. You're mad.""I'm not mad."Sirius rummaged in his bag, pulling out a bottle of water. He took the handkerchief from Remus so he could get it wet then handed it back. He watched Remus clean for a few seconds then said slowly, "James and I are keeping a secret from you."Remus clenched his teeth as he began wiping his face again. The dampness helped get rid of some of the ink. "I am well aware."Sirius tilted his head, raising his eyebrows. "You're keeping something from us," he accused."Well, what would that be?" Remus asked, feeling sick, his limbs feeling heavy.Sirius flopped back in the seat, folding his arms. Remus waited for his response with trepidation and terror. "Please," he finally replied, "if I knew what it was, it wouldn't be a secret, now, would it?"Remus crumpled up the handkerchief and jammed it in one of his satchel's pockets, trying not to give a sigh of relief. "I am not mad that you're keeping a secret from me.""You obviously—""I'm not!" he snapped and Sirius shut his mouth. "I'm mad because instead of simply telling me you had a secret, you lied about it! You-you tried to cover it up which made me feel like—like—like...""Like what?" Sirius asked. Remus remained silent. "Come on, then. Like what?"Remus curled his fingers into fists. "Like you don't trust me," he finally whispered, then the true confession slipped past his lips: "Like I don't matter.""Remus—""I know. It—it's stupid, it's..." He let out a slow breath, trying to control his emotions. "We've been... friends for almost a year now but—" He hesitated before plunging on, "but I still expect you guys to stop wanting to put up with me any day.""What?!" he yelped and a voice somewhere a few aisles away made a shhhhh sound. Sirius glared in their direction then leaned in. "What?" he asked again, this time quietly.Remus didn't dare look at him. "I'm Loopy Lupin. I know this. People still call me this, and—and it's kinda true." He began scratching at the table's surface. "I'm not... normal. It's difficult for me to... t-to be like... other kids.""I don't want you to be like other kids!" Sirius growled, smacking the table. "I want you to be you!"Remus's lips tugged into a small smile. "It still worries me. How I am. How I..."How he sometimes felt like screaming, like crying, like hiding; how people made him feel overwhelmed, that he needed to stop having any sort of social interaction before their very words turned into blades against his skin, his soul. That sometimes he wanted to tear himself apart because being a person was too damn much.He didn't want to even attempt to explain this, didn't want to show how crazy he really was. Instead he said, "I don't mind you lot having secrets just... please don't make it so obvious I'm being excluded."Sirius just stared at him, completely still, completely silent. Then he swore under his breath, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Merlin. Remy, I— I never meant to make you feel that way. I—I don't like that that's how I came across. I..."Remus knew he was trying to say 'sorry' without saying the actual word since he had a very hard time properly apologizing, and pretty much never did. He did say the word on occasion but very rare occasions.Sirius gave up the struggle and continued talking. "I like how you are. James and Pete both do too, I know they do! We all like you for who you are." He scooted the chair closer which made Remus grow a little uncomfortable, and a little warm. "You're our friend, okay? Our friend. And you're not being excluded." He paused then gave a small, nervous chuckle. "Well—you... you are right now, but so is Peter.""You plan on telling Peter whatever it is," Remus pointed out bitterly."Yes." Sirius's silver eyes bore into Remus. "Just as we plan on telling you too. Like... like James's cloak! James told me about it ages ago. And... then he got it, and told both of you too."Remus looked down, suddenly feeling extremely stupid. If I had waited another moment before barging in would they have brought me up? Said they were going to tell me whatever it is? He hadn't even thought of that. He had just... assumed... like an idiot...Sirius smiled, reaching out to put a hand against Remus's arm. "I promise we'll tell you down the line, all right?"Slowly he looked back up, meeting Sirius's gaze. He's being honest. "All right," Remus said, body slumping a little bit as the weight was lifted. "I'm sorry. I—I was... I am being so... silly." He began rubbing his eyes now, nose itching. "I just...""It's fine. I understand." Sirius squeezed his arm then let go. "But do you really think we're just gonna stop being friends with you? You think we're gonna suddenly not like you?"Crap. Remus turned back to his parchment, fiddling with the quill, trying to figure out the best way to explain without venturing into what he didn't want to say. "Sirius, I've literally never had friends until a year ago. That coupled with the fact that I am not normal—definitely not normal—does indeed make me concerned."Sirius didn't say anything for such a long stretch of time that it made Remus feel extremely ill. He was just on the verge of going to the bathroom to vomit when Sirius said something very softly. "I worry too.""What?"Sirius turned the chair away so he could look at the row of books nearby, eyes searching across their titles. Remus thought perhaps he meant he worried about Remus's abnormality too, which frightened (and worried) him."I worry about you guys suddenly not liking me," he admitted, voice hardly audible. He bent forward, pushing his fingers angrily through his hair, leaving them there.Remus couldn't fathom what he just heard. "But... b—but you... you're... Sirius.""And you're Remus," he replied icily, glaring. "What makes me special but not you?""Everything," Remus blurted out.Sirius straightened up, hand dropping, staring at Remus's reddening face. He began smiling again. "I'm a Black," he replied casually.Ah, Remus thought. "I think we've all made it quite clear by now your bloodline doesn't bother us." He dipped his quill back into the ink so he could begin rewriting the essay."Well, I think we've all made it quite clear by now your weirdness doesn't bother us either." Remus couldn't very well argue with that. He bent in again, writing the words as neatly as he could. "I like you, Remy." Remus didn't look up though he felt himself getting hotter again. The way Sirius said that made his stomach feel all squirmy and weird, too, which didn't make any sort of sense to him. "You're my friend. Nothing's gonna change that, okay? Nothing."You'll eat those words if you ever figure out the truth, he thought. He wanted to reassure Sirius the same but couldn't because one day he'd have to do exactly what neither of them wanted: stop being friends. Course, he probably should lie. He didn't want to hurt Sirius, not like that. "You're my friend too. Nothing... will change that..." He wished that could be true, so bad. His heart lurched with the absolute ache for that to be true. "And again I am sorry for... overreacting...""Nah, you didn't overreact!" The lightness had come back to Sirius's voice as he leaned his chair back, the front legs lifting off the floor. "I completely get why you got mad.""N-not mad. Upset. There is a difference."Sirius stuck his tongue out. "Fine, fine, upset, if you insist on being, um, um, eh, wordsy about it." The chair came crashing down with a loud bang, sending more 'ssshhhh!'s their way. Sirius made such an exaggerated face in response Remus snickered."As I said, it's fine to have secrets." He thought of James's confession to him about his grandfather, his pleading not to tell the others. "We all have secrets from one another, it's only natural.""S'pose so." Sirius began reading through the splattered essay again. "I hope you can trust me though.""I do," he answered without hesitation. He stared down at the parchment then over at a nearby clock. He wouldn't have time to rewrite the entire thing as well as eat lunch. He considered skipping lunch though it wouldn't buy him a whole lot of time. He flexed his fingers then began writing again quickly, his handwriting slowly returning to its usual scrawl. "I'm glad you don't mind my oddities.""And I'm glad you don't mind my Black blood."He recalled when Miss Fawley warned him about Sirius's family, about his his relative had blinded her, her sister killed Elara Black, then the Black family demanded Miss Fawley's sister be executed for it. His blood is Black, she had told him, like it truly meant something, like a person's familial history meant someone had to be a certain way. Others seemed to believe that too. It was so stupid. Sirius's family was awful (except for Regulus since he was just a kid), that didn't mean Sirius was awful."You're you, not them," he muttered, the words in front of him blurring slightly as his head began hurting. It felt like it had already been an entire day not just one morning, not just one class.Sirius sucked in some air, almost in an annoyed manner but when he spoke he sounded pleased. "That's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me."It was on the tip of Remus's tongue to ask after his family, about all the rumors, what Fawley said, what he thought he knew about the Black family but Sirius looked so cheered that he didn't dare. "I'm just gonna have to hand in my old essay." He pushed the papers away, taking the original, scanning it to make sure it was semi-decent."I'm glad we're friends."Remus lifted his gaze. "Me too."Sirius got up, a hand against Remus's shoulder. "I meant what I said by the way. Friends, no matter what." There seemed to be something heavy in his voice and it felt as though he were pressing down with more than just his hand. Remus just stared up, bewildered, wanting to ask what he meant but it had been such an innocuous statement he wasn't sure if he could ask. He couldn't very well say how... intense the tone had been."Friends no matter what," Remus agreed as there was not much else to say. He got up, tucking his essay into his bag and crumpling up the rest of the parchment to throw away. He followed Sirius to the Great Hall (where he apologized to James for his attitude) then wound up having to go to Defense still smelling of dried sweat and dirt from Herbology, and having some ink smeared across his face./\/\/\/\/\The next day or so seemed to be a precarious balance of recovering from hurt feelings. It wasn't as bad as after the fight with James, or the fight Remus had had the previous year with Lily, but it was still a go-carefully type of thing. Peter pulled Remus aside at one point to ask if he knew the secret or anything about it, and Remus just told him all he knew is the others planned to tell the two of them 'eventually'. Then the two began theorizing what it could be. Peter stood by his idea that it was a really big prank, while Remus suspected it might be something more along the lines of Fort Dragon. Not necessarily a fort but something tangible for the group."What's tangible mean?" Pete asked, forehead wrinkled.Remus frowned. "Errr... um, it's like—something, a—an object, like something you can touch. An idea for a prank is intangible because it is not physical, whereas the Fort is tangible, something physical.""Oh, okay," Pete said, nodding though he didn't quite seem to get it."Hey Pete...""Yeah?""Are you afraid of monkeys?"Pete stopped in his tracks, eyes going rather big before walking again. "No? I don't think so. Why? Is there a monkey around here?""No. But I think they want to do something with a monkey. Just... making sure.""I don't like flying monkeys though."Now Remus stopped walking. "What? Flying monkeys?""Yeah, from that movie. With, um, the weird witches and—no place like home.""Wizard of Oz," Remus said and Peter nodded."Yeah, my dad likes that movie. Mum hates it, says it's a stupid, ummm, stereotipping of witches.""Stereotyping," Remus corrected. "I understand that. It does have strange portrays of witches in it." He enjoyed the movie for the most part when he saw it though the book was a million times better. Although the shoes in the book were silver—not ruby—so the movie was better in that respect!Peter shrugged. "Dad watched it with me when I was young. The flying monkeys were so creepy. I liked the songs though. You know, now that I think of it, it's kinda weird that the things they sing about are like the Hogwarts houses. You know, bravery, heart, and brains. Nothing for Slytherin though."Remus stared off into the distance. "I can see Dorothy being a Slytherin. Going to the ends of the earth—er, Oz—to achieve her goal.""But she was so nice!""Some Slytherins are nice," he pointed out.Peter made a face. "I guess. Do you think they have any idea what Wizard of Oz is? James and Sirius, I mean."Remus shook his head. "I highly doubt it. Hmm, you know, we probably shouldn't mention it to them because otherwise..." Remus trailed off, giving Peter a look.He groaned. "Yeah, they'll totally want to make flying monkeys! Definitely don't ever mention that movie to them! Course they don't even know what a movie even is so probably not that big of a danger, right?""Right." Remus wanted to laugh as he tried imagining attempting to explain what a movie was to their pureblooded friends, although he couldn't help but wonder if it was something that Muggle Studies would cover or not. He knew James and Sirius had both discussed the possibility of taking that class since it was said to be so easy, however he thought it'd be nice if they learned about Muggles... if the class actually taught things properly and didn't just diminish Muggles into appearing to be dumb, lesser beings like some magical folk assumed.That got him to thinking about the electives, and which ones to take. He still had plenty of time to decide but it was so difficult to choose between them! They all seemed so interesting! He thought he had read something about some people in the past getting more OWLs than the core classes plus two electives, but he couldn't really remember, he hadn't been able to find any information in what little research he had done, and he was too nervous to actually ask anyone. Nobody else appeared to be worrying about which to choose right now, and he didn't want to seem to be... well... weird.Once the time came to discuss things with McGonagall, he could ask her, but he knew he had to make a choice beforehand just in case. Which was just so difficult!

Friday night at study group everyone showed up with a little trepidation. Twycross came in, nose in the air, ponytail swinging. She just set her books down then sat down, giving everyone looks as if to say, what? She barely gave any attitude, and was pretty pleasant to Remus. He doubted it would last very long. He got the feeling Twycross really disliked him. She never outright said it but it was just sort of the aura she gave.At one point Bones asked Remus if his friends had been the ones who put up the spiderweb stuff near the kitchens earlier that day. Remus pretended like he didn't know, but Twycross muttered 'who else?'."You always act as if they're innocent," she told Remus as they left the library. "Whenever something happens it's them.""N-n-n-not always," he muttered.Twycross rolled her eyes and gave a disgusted sound, which she repeated when they got to the Gryffindor common room. They had just climbed through then froze, staring in horror at the slime oozing out from... seemingly everywhere. There was about an inch of slime all over the floor and some of it clung to a lot of the furniture. Lily finally went forward, sloshing through the slime. Remus followed, finally Twycross coming as well."Three guesses to who did this," Twycross accused."J—just because something happened d-does not mean they did it!" Remus glanced around, not seeing them. He did see several students glaring at him which meant it had been his friends, or at least everyone assumed it was. Finally he realized the fireplace was out, the green slime sluppering out from there in a small yet steady stream. A few prefects stood around it in a semi-circle trying to get it to stop. It wasn't coming out of the chimney, it was just welling up as if there were a slime spring inside the fireplace.Lily approached another student, asking her what happened. The girl turned her gaze to Remus. "The idiots," she informed Lily. "His friends."Twycross began smirking. "Told you. Something happens, it's them. Stop that dumb innocent act, Lupin, everyone knows trouble means Potter and Black!"Remus shlucked his way to the boys' stairs, heading up, leaving footprints. He reached the dorm where he thankfully found them. Two of them, at least. James and Peter. Oh right, Sirius has detention, he remembered as he shut the door. "Anyone wanna tell me—""Pete's fault," James replied immediately."NOT MY FAULT!" Peter shouted. "I j—just—I said—and you were the one who—""Fine, fine, Pete's idea, my fault," James snorted, going back to his Quidditch magazine.Peter pouted. "It was NOT my idea! We were talking about creepy stories since Halloween is coming up—""It's the month of Halloween," James replied, not looking up from the magazine. "It should be a holiday all month long.""Anyway, so we were telling creepy stories and the—the one I told had green slime oozing out of the walls so Jimmy thought... he'd try it.""You told me to do it! You encouraged me!""Yeah, in the bathroom!" Peter squeaked, pointing a finger towards the door. "I swear I told him to try the spell in the bathroom, not the common room!"Remus sat on the edge of James's bed. "How did you manage to get the fireplace to continually spout?""No idea!" James sat up, looking very proud of himself. "Didn't even mean for it to be the fireplace. Hey, Remy, remember last year we were talking about making bats fly around? Can we try it this year? I made a bat, to try it out." He pulled a paper bat out from his desk drawer."I—I think right now we should focus on the fact we've got a spring of slime in the common room," Remus said slowly.James completely ignored him. "Wingardium leviosa!" The paper-bat levitated in the air, following James's wand's movements.Remus gave up trying to talk to him, moving over to Peter's bed. "Are you in trouble?"Pete shrugged. "We got points taken away. Plus I think McGonsie is gonna be giving us a lecture tomorrow or something. Probably detention. We were kicked out of the common room, the prefect—um, the oldest one—was all 'I don't even want to look at you'."Remus snorted, covering his mouth. "At least they didn't get Professor McGonagall right away. So you suggested the bathroom?"Pete sat upright. "Yes. I told the creepy story then James said how cool it would be to make slime ooze out of the walls and I said yeah that would be super neat do you know a slime spell? And he said he thought he did, so I said okay let's go try it out in the bathroom so we can clean up easily. He said he didn't feel like going up the stairs, pointed at the wall near the fireplace, and shot the spell out."James began laughing. "Yep, that's how it went." He kept fluttering the bat around then when he ended the spell the bat fell. "We really need the spell to keep it moving on its own." Suddenly he gasped, eyes going huge. "We... should have... the bats oozing slime!""Yes!" Peter squealed excitedly."Either way, I appreciate you at least suggesting the bathroom," Remus told Peter, purposely ignoring James. "At least someone around here has somewhat of a voice of reason when I'm not around."James blew a raspberry, giving him the two finger salute. Remus shook his head, returning to his own bed to do some relaxing. He wasn't really feeling edgy but he felt kinda... bleh, so he went under his bed anyway to give himself some extra comfort. He paused before going under, glancing at his friends, then flopped to the floor, wriggling underneath with a blanket and a book. He wrapped himself up and read, enjoying the feeling of calmness that settled around him from being in such a tight space. The other two were playing music but it wasn't too loud.When Sirius came in a bit later Remus felt rather warmed when he asked, "Is Remus not here?" in a disappointed tone then gave a happy noise when Peter told him. Remus watched him approach the bed then he bent over. "You doing all right?""Yeah, I'm okay," he said."You sure?""Y—yeah?"Sirius crouched down. "Okay just making sure since you're under here.""Oh." He gave Sirius a reassuring smile. "I'm really all right, I just wanted to be under here." He knew how weird that was however Sirius had just said that they liked Remus even with his weirdness."Okay." Sirius smiled back. He then got a deck of cards, laying down on his belly next to Remus's bed to play some games. Soon Peter joined, then finally James, the three other Marauders laying in a semi-circle while Remus remained under his bed. Remus didn't say anything about it, just basked in the bliss of having friends who would do something like this in his life.It didn't last long though. McGonagall had been called in to get rid of the slime fountain then had a prefect fetch James who was made to clean up all the slime. She didn't forbid him help so Sirius, Pete, and Remus all helped him, rolling up their trouser legs and taking their socks and shoes off as they worked. They didn't really know many helpful cleaning spells so it had to be done the Muggle way, with mops and buckets, constantly having to haul the buckets up to the bathroom to empty them out then refill them.It was nearly midnight before they finally finished up, James thanking them profusely as they trudged up the stairs to empty the buckets out one last time. Remus's arms were exhausted and he was soaked in sweat and slime. He thought of his bed before collapsing into the shower to clean himself up, not wanting to wake up in the grossness. He had vague nightmares that night of slime tidal waves destroying the school./\/\/\/\/\Remus slept in very late the next day, as did the other Marauders. They were all completely exhausted from all the cleaning though there was still some cleaning needed as the furniture still had slime on their lower parts. All the rugs were back though, clean. Lily remarked on this when they went to lunch, questioning him about what exactly happened. Remus explained only a little bit, explaining mostly about the cleaning job they had to do."Professor McGonagall made you clean too?" Colgate asked from Lily's other side. "You weren't even there, were you?""N... no, I—I didn't have to clean but I w-wanted to help James,""Enabling him, you mean," Lily grumbled."If he made the mess, he should clean it by himself," added Inkwood.Remus just fiddled with his sandwich, knowing they were both right. Technically. "It t-t—took all four of us hours to c-clean the floor. It wo—would have been nearly imp—possible for James to do on his own.""He should have thought of it before he did that!" Colgate argued."He—he didn't mean to m-make that happen!" Remus argued right back, causing Colgate's eyes to grow big. "I know they t—tend not to think about things, but he honestly j-just meant a bit of slime to come out of th—the wall. Why should he b-be punished for accidental magical side effects?"That got them all quiet then finally Lily sighed, agreeing that she supposed Remus had a good point, which was the most he figured he'd get from her. She then changed the subject to the Hufflepuffskeins who were having a concert in Hogsmeade at Halloween and how it wasn't fair they weren't allowed to go. Inkwood and Colgate agreed, all three of them saying how fun it would be if the teachers could arrange an outing. Though, Lily supposed, it would be difficult if a lot of students wanted to go. Remus didn't chime in with any opinions although he did think the opportunity to go should be given to older students, like those who had permission to go to Hogsmeade in the first place.After lunch Remus headed to Defense Against the Dark Arts, as he was having his first proper re-test. Professor Prewett had explained it would pretty much the tests given before Christmas of his first year. Remus mostly felt confident though the fact he didn't really have time to study made his stomach hurt. He had only been told a week ago."Come in!" Remus entered the classroom a little nervously, despite the big smile Professor Prewett was giving him. "Hallo Lupin, come on in! Have a seat wherever you like." Remus went over to the first seat near the door, setting his things down. "How has your day been going? I heard the Gryffindor common room had a plague of slime last night. Was that your friends' doing?""Err—y-yeah, one of them," Remus mumbled, sliding into the chair."On purpose?""Um, s—sorta, I... I guess not really?"Prewett gave Remus an encouraging look. "My brother and I caused quite a bit of trouble while we were here, so don't worry about sharing anything with me. As long as you're not hurting anyone else, I don't see much wrong with mischief making." Remus knew if his friends knew this they'd be hero worshipping him! "Now, shall we begin?"The test didn't take very long at all. It was so easy! It barely even took him twenty minutes to even double check though. He considered handing it in then triple checked, just in case. He handed the paper in and sat around while Prewett graded him, which also didn't take very long either."Very good, Mr. Lupin!" Prewett handed it back to him. "A hundred and fifteen percent.""It—it is a first year's exam, and—and I am a s—second year," he murmured.Prewett rolled his eyes. "Still. Very good. I've been highly impressed by you. Your parents must be very proud.""Y—yes," he said, looking down at the paper. "Um, s-so this is... will this be... going in and—I mean, this is to be my grade for the December tests?"Prewett nodded. "Yes. Professor Dumbledore has given me permission to do this, so after you are finished with all the exams I give you, your end-of-year grade will be updated."Remus hoped he wasn't beaming too much. "I t—truly appreciate this opportunity, sir." He carefully folded the paper, tucking it into his bag. "But I—I have to ask, if this... is very fair?""Fair?""I mean... loads of students get poor grades," Remus explained, looking down at the floor. "Is it fair th-that I get the—the chance to remedy my grades whereas others... do not?"Prewett tilted his head. "You're asking if it's fair after the previous teacher purposely and intentionally mistreated you and gave you bad grades?" Remus had no idea how to respond to that so he remained silent. "Professor McGonagall was quite right about you.""Wh—what?""Nothing." Prewett waved his hand as if his words didn't matter. "Most students are given the opportunity to make up for poor grades, however poor grades are typically due to their own failures and not the teacher abusing them.""A...!" Remus paled. "N—no, Professor Dedenne n—never abused me!""Abuse is not merely physical pain, Mr. Lupin," Prewett said carefully. Again, Remus wasn't sure what to say so he opted for nothing. "You deserve a chance to fix your misgraded work.""O...okay," he got out. "Again, th—thank you. I-I didn't mean to question everything, I just... I w—want to make sure I'm n-not being given... sp—special treatment.""Nothing wrong with a little special treatment!" Prewett then frowned when he saw Remus frowning. "Look at it this way..." He turned around to the blackboard and drew two Xs, one higher than the other. "Dedenne put all her students here." He tapped the higher X. "She treated them with fairness, grading their papers as they deserved to be graded. And she put you here." He tapped the lower X. "Purposely pushing you beneath everyone else. What we are doing is..." He now waved his wand and the lower X rose up to be even with the first one. "Is this. Putting you on the same level as everyone else. Where you should be. Your grades are terrific due to your own intelligence, not because I am doing the opposite of what she did by purposely giving you better grades, I'm grading you as you deserve. We're just giving you an... even playing field. Does that help you feel any better?"Remus clutched his bag to his chest, nodding. "Y-yes sir, th—thank you that does make me feel a lot better.""Good." Prewett waved his wand, the Xs disappearing. "Now, go enjoy your Saturday afternoon and cause some trouble with your friends. Have a good day, Mr. Lupin."/\/\/\/\/\Remus did spend the weekend causing a lot of trouble with his friends as usual, as well as making preparations for the Babbling Brew which they'd be starting during the week, to be done before Halloween. They tried brewing a potion in the pit passageway which seemed to work perfectly fine, and they left it overnight Saturday; when they came back on Sunday it was still there, undisturbed.Of course, Remus wasn't going to help out making the potion at all, especially after on Monday morning his class potion turned out even worse than normal. It was very thick sludge that Slughorn had to make disappear. Then after class Slughorn said Remus's name three times before it got his attention."I need to speak to you a moment," he said.Remus stayed behind, figuring it was because of the disaster he had made. Snape was smirking at him as he left and Remus could hear him quietly laughing to himself. He rolled his eyes, shifting his weight from foot to foot as he waited. Finally the last student left and they were alone. Remus waited to be admonished but to his surprise Slughorn had something else to talk about."You haven't RSVPed to the dinner party," he said, linking his fingers together over his enormous belly. "It's Friday evening, only a couple days away."Remus pressed his lips thin, feeling a little bad. "I—I'm sorry, P-Professor, I—I forgot to—to send a message saying I wasn't coming." He hadn't even thought of doing that, honestly. "I was j-just busy with homework.""Not coming?" Slughorn raised his eyebrows. "Why is that?""Er. Well, I d-don't think it's really my s-sort of thing." Remus tugged at his bag strap, taking a step back, wishing they weren't having this conversation."How come?"Ugh. "I'm not a—a very... social person," he explained carefully. "I'd p-prefer to spend my time doing homework."Slughorn smiled. "It's only one evening, Mr. Lupin. It's a terrific opportunity.""I—I appreciate that, I do, I-I just—" He began panicking, no idea how to get out of this.Slughorn got to his feet with a grunt. "The Slug Club is for only a select few, and I have chosen you to join. It's an honor, Mr. Lupin. After this dinner I'll probably be weeding the students out even more, and I know you'll be one of the ones to be formally invited as a true member."Remus began tugging at the hem of his vest, feeling sick and even more panicky. "Why me, s—sir?" he asked, unable to not ask. Slughorn had previously used his grades as a reason however suspected it was because he was a werewolf. Sure enough this time Slughorn replied his grades. "I only got an A in P—Potions for the final exams last year," he pointed out."Your overall grades," Slughorn said, beaming at him. "Your grades are beyond fantastic! You have a very bright mind."You're lying, he thought miserably. He could tell. Sense it. He wasn't sure which of his wolf senses picked up lies but he could typically tell when someone was lying, and Slughorn was doing just that. Not about Remus's bright mind or grades, but about that being why he was picked. He plucked more at the hem, tugging a thread loose, feeling his insides prickling, his skin beginning to feel scrape-y."Your friends Mr. Potter and Miss Evans have both sent in their assurance they will be there," Slughorn added, nodding. "It will be a lot of fun. You should come to the dinner, at least see how that is. It will be quite different from the Christmas party. Yes, you should come, I think you would enjoy it. It's for the second and third years. Friday, at five-thirty."That was that. Remus spluttered with trying to get out of it but Slughorn was shooing him out of the room, sending out a cheerful farewell before shutting the door. Remus stared at the door, a little bit in shock. He jumped when Peter touched his shoulder."It was about the dinner," he explained to their confused looks. "Friday. I... I guess I'm going...""You weren't, though, were you?" James asked as they headed towards their next class.Remus shook his head. "No. I had no intention of going. It's just Slughorn seemed so... adamant..."James flung an arm across his shoulder. "Then don't go. Don't let a Slytherin bully you into anything.""He's one of our Professors as well as Head of a house! I can't just... dismiss him like he's a student!" Remus complained, still feeling nauseated by the whole ordeal. His skin had the scraping problem, and James's arm across his shoulders didn't help one bit. He let his satchel slide down his shoulder a bit then it fell to the ground. He ducked away from James's arm to pick it up, hoping it would all look accidental; thankfully James didn't put his arm back on Remus."You should though, if you don't wanna go you shouldn't go!" Peter said. "He shouldn't be add... addent that you have to go.""Adamant," Remus mumbled."Adamant," he repeated with a nod.Remus managed a smile. "Do you know what adamant means?""No, but it's probably bad," Peter admitted."It means... firm. You're set on something. Like James and Sirius are adamant about causing trouble."Sirius laughed. "Yeah we are."James grabbed Sirius's arm. "Speaking of causing trouble—""Oh no," Peter moaned."—we should do the slime thing in the Slytherin common room! After I practice it a bit more, of course." James continued, ignoring Peter."That would be a brilliant prank to play however due to the fact everyone knows you did that in the Gryffindor common room you'd essentially be revealing the fact you have access to the Slytherin common room," Remus pointed out.James made a face. "Drat. Why do you always have to be right?"Sirius shrugged. "Then let's do it to their table in the Great Hall. It'll make them feel more at home."James bust up laughing at that, Peter snickering too. Remus wanted to, but kept it inside. "You'll get in loads of trouble," he said and his friends shrugged. "You might get in less trouble if you do it in the corridors near the Slytherin common room, as it doesn't involve the destruction of their meal.""Good point," James said, nodding. "But think about this..." Suddenly he clasped his hands to his chest, eyes going wide, eyelashes fluttering. "Professor McGonagall I didn't mean to hit the Slytherin table! I was trying to turn Sirius's food into slime but it missed! I'm so sorry!"Sirius and Peter applauded while Remus just covered his face at the melodrama. "I doubt she'll believe—""Cool, that's sorted then," James cut him off. "The Slytherin table it is!"

A distant cry of distress jerked Remus out of his book. He glanced up, realizing nobody else in the common room had heard the sound. It was Tuesday morning, between Herbology and lunch; he had gotten a quick shower then went down to the common room to read and wait for his friends, since Sirius always took ages to take a shower. He shut the book then went up the stairs, thinking the shout had been Peter. He tapped at their dorm door then went in, gasping slightly at the mess everywhere. Clothes, papers, comic books... it was like something exploded. Peter was kneeling in front of the wardrobe he shared with James, the bottom drawer open as he yanked clothes out, tossing them behind him. James was partially under Peter's bed."Wh—what's going on?" Remus asked, shutting the door behind him."My journal!" Pete wailed. "It's gone!""It's not under here, mate," James said, wriggling completely underneath. "Found your Gryffindor socks you were missing though."Remus waded through the mess. "Where should I look?" he asked, wanting to help."I don't know!" Peter sat back on his heels, tugging at his hair. "I—I had it under my bed—the mattress part, I mean—but it's not there!"Remus went over to Pete's bed, pushing up the mattress. "James, help lift the other side just in case." Together they lifted the mattress clear up on the off chance it had just slid somewhere but it was a no. They set the mattress back down then Remus began looking under other beds. Shortly after Sirius came in wearing one of his fancy bathrobes, toweling his hair. They told him what was going on and he got his clothes, hiding behind his curtains to change then popping back out to help search."What is it? What's it look like?" Sirius asked."It's a—a red journal, it's got a gold spine. My dad bought it for me for my twelfth birthday." Peter pushed his hair back then collapsed down. "I use it mostly for—for notes and stuff about photography, for photography club and stuff. I—I was g-gonna go take some pictures after Defense and—I can't find it!""We'll find it," James promised.Remus got his wand out. "I doubt this will work but accio journal!" Everyone froze, waiting. Nothing happened. "Accio Peter's journal!" Still nothing. "Accio photography journal! Accio red journal! Accio red book!""You know how to do the summoning spell?" James asked, impressed."No," he admitted, lowering his wand. "I just... hoped. I'm sorry, Petey.""S'fine," he whimpered. "It's just I got some personal stuff in there too and I don't want anyone seeing it! Like, no offense, not even you guys!" He flopped onto his back, moaning. "I'm so stupid.""How are you stupid?" Sirius demanded as he began literally dismantling Spinnet's bed. He yanked the blanket off then the mattress, pulling it to the floor. "Just cause you lost something doesn't mean you're stupid.""Maybe we can get a prefect to try the summoning spell?" Remus suggested.Peter bounced up to his feet. "YES! OH MY GOD REMUS!" He flung himself at Remus, hugging him tightly, squeezing the breath out. "You're so smart!""Hhhhk."Pete let go, stumbling towards the door. "Is there one in the common room? Come on, come on!" He grabbed Remus's hand, pulling him down the stairs. Remus cast a glance around then spotted the sixth year male prefect. "No, you ask," Pete whimpered, pushing Remus before him.Remus sighed, going over. Talking to strangers was an anguishing experience however for his friend it wasn't quite as bad. "Um, e—excuse me," he mumbled. The prefect looked up. "S-sorry to b-b-bother you but we're n-needing a little help. If th—that's possible.""What sort of help?" He set his quill down, raising an eyebrow. "Did Barmy and Pratty do something?""N-no!" Remus frowned a bit at those nicknames, at the fact a prefect was using them. "Peter l-lost a book—an important, um, book—and—and I w-w-was wondering if you c-could possibly t-try using the summoning spell in our dor—dorm."The prefect looked past Remus at the trembling Peter. Slowly he got up, stretching. "Fiiiiine. Tell me exactly what this thing looks like."Peter described the book to a T as they went up the stairs. The prefect crinkled his nose when he saw the disaster but he came into the room anyway, doing a small turn to look around. Then he got his wand out. "Accio!" He didn't use a descriptive word but they all heard a loud banging sound. The five of them swivelled to look at Spinnet's desk.James ran over, tugging at the locked drawer. "Alohomora." He pulled the drawer open and Pete's journal zoomed to the prefect who caught it, handing it to Peter."Sp—Spinnet?" Pete asked, clutching the journal. "Spinnet stole it?!""That little TWAT!" Sirius shouted furiously. "He stole it! Did—did you see that?!" he demanded of the prefect. "Our dormmate stole something!""That is yours?" the prefect asked, a little suspiciously. Peter opened the front of the book. Happy 12th, Captain Pete! Love Dad. "I see." The prefect looked very displeased. "I'll inform Professor McGonagall. This is highly unsavory! I cannot believe it...!" He gave Peter's shoulder a pat before sweeping out, slamming the door shut behind him."Ass!" James ran over and kicked Spinnet's mattress which was still on the floor. "Oh, he is gonna GET IT!""Wh—why would he d-d-do this?" Peter asked, still clinging to his journal."Because he's an ASSHOLE!" James roared."Let's clean up the room—except his stuff, of course," Sirius said, kicking at a shirt on the floor.They worked as quickly as they could, leaving Spinnet's bed stuff on the floor, his locked drawer open. James wanted to snoop through it but Remus convinced him not to, telling him that would make him no better than Spinnet. They finished up about ten minutes into lunch and hurried through the school, Peter keeping his journal in his bag for now.To Remus's surprise his friends didn't confront Spinnet when they went into lunch. He expected a big blow out but they just took their seats, ignoring their classmate down the table. Lunch proceeded as normal then James wanted to leave a bit early. Remus realized when he stopped down the hall from Defense than he intended on confronting Spinnet there. Sure enough, as soon as Spinnet and Struthers appeared James got his wand out, going over, sticking his wand right into Spinnet's face."You twat," he growled out.Struthers backed away quickly in a panic while Spinnet just took one step back. "Merlin, Potter, what's your problem?""You!" James narrowed his eyes, ignoring the other second years who had started to come down the hallway then stopped, watching. Lily glanced towards Remus but he just kept his eyes on James and Spinnet. "You stole from Peter!""What? I did not!" Spinnet scoffed.James angled his wand a bit. "Liar! McGonagall's already been told!"Spinnet scoffed at that. "Making up stories to get me in trouble?""We didn't say a thing," Sirius said, casually striding over. "A prefect's told her, after witnessing your theft."Spinnet's eyes darted back and forth while the girls began whispering. "I never stole anything from Pettigrew! You guys are insane!"Peter, whose face was going quite pink, took his journal out of his bag. "Then why was this in your locked drawer?!" he demanded.Spinnet actually paled at the sight of the journal. "You—you broke into my desk!" he spluttered out."Yes, I did," James agreed. "After the prefect tried to summon Peter's book so we could find it! How did it get locked up in your desk if you didn't steal it, hmmmm?""Perhaps it jumped in when he wasn't looking," suggested Sirius with a lazy sort of smirk.Spinnet was clearly panicking now. He glanced back at the girls then back at the Marauders. "I, er, found it. On the floor. I wasn't sure who it belonged to so I put it in my desk until I had time to ask.""Isn't there a table in the middle of your room?" asked Magpie. "We've got one in ours, where the water pitcher usually is. Why not put the book there?""We do," Sirius said.Spinnet wiped his hands off on his trousers. "I'm not dealing with this! Move it, Pratty!" He shoulder-checked James then strode down the hall. Everyone just watched him go then looked at Struthers."I had no idea he did that," Struthers mumbled. "He never mentioned that book to me, I swear! If I knew he had stolen anything I would have made him give it back.""Why are you even friends with him?" James asked. "He's so mean!"Struthers opened and closed his mouth a couple times them jutted his jaw out. "He might not be the nicest person around but at least he doesn't go around hexing people for fun like you two do! Some of your pranks can be funny but mostly they're just dumb or annoying, or cause problems for people! Maybe Andy did one or two things wrong but compared to your long list of jerkiness, he's definitely a lot better!" With that he stomped off.Remus could hear some of the girls agreeing with that (Lily included). James put his wand away. "Can't wait for McGonagall to talk to him," he said then headed to class, the other Marauders following.After Defense Prewett had Remus stay behind to go over some of his essays which were 'very good'. Prewett said it wasn't just the make up essays that were impressing him, it was all of Remus's work in class. "It's clear this is your element," he explained as Remus stood there, tugging at his sleeve. "I think we might as well set up times for your other two exams right now. The ones before the Easter holidays, and the end-of-year exams. Would you like to do both of them before the Christmas holiday?""Um, y—yes, please," Remus mumbled."I'll continue giving you a list of essays, of course. Now. How about the twenty-eighth of this month and the eighteenth of next month?""Um... I—I can't remember when the first Gryffindor game is, and—and I've promised J-James I'd be there."Prewett smiled. "It's on the eleventh."Remus perked up. "All r-right. That works f-for me, thank you Professor.""May I ask you something?" Remus gave a small nod, wondering why his teacher was even asking. "Is your father Lyall Lupin?"The question shocked Remus, and made him feel a little sick with worry. "Y... yes, sir."Professor Prewett nodded. "I thought you might be related but I wasn't quite sure. I met him a couple times when I was starting at the Ministry, just before he left. He is a very talented man, and I can see why you have such an affinity for this realm."Remus just looked down, guilt eating away at him. His father had had a good job at the Ministry before Remus was bitten, then Lyall had to leave. To help protect Remus. Hearing about his father's abilities should have made him feel proud but he just felt depressed. If he had never been bitten, his father would still be there."That really explains this." Prewett held up one of the essays Remus had handed in on Thursday. The one about boggarts. "Your father is the one who defeated the infamous Screaming Bogey of Strathtully, isn't he?"Remus just shrugged. He didn't know much of his father's career pre-bite, just that he loved his job, missed it, and had been well known for taking care of boggarts. He had never heard of the Screaming Bogey before. Had his father really done that? He had trained Remus from a young age how to fight dementors and boggarts, taught him all about them. While he had never personally experienced actually performing the spells he did know how to do both the patronus spell and boggart-fighting spell. He had seen his father's patronus on occasion, and had once seen his father defeat a boggart that someone tried to get rid of by selling an old trunk to the antique store, knowing the boggart was in there. Lyall had brought it home specifically to show Remus how to fight them."Are you all right?""Y-yes sir, sorry," Remus said quickly, trying to smile. "My father does know a lot about non-human spirituous apparitions. He—he taught me.""That's good to hear. Can you show me the boggart spell?"Remus raised his eyebrows but obediently got his wand out. "Riddikulus!" he exclaimed, flicking his wand at nothing."Excellent! I'll be doing a class sometime in the spring about boggarts. I'm hoping to actually get one though I'm not sure if I will be able to. Do you know what your boggart is?""N—no sir," he answered, putting his wand away. "I expect something to do w-with the... the... you know.""That's what I thought," Prewett agreed. "I think if I do manage to get a boggart I'll allow anyone who doesn't wish to reveal their deepest fears to sit out, therefore I won't be singling you out." There was a knock at the door and Prewett jumped a little in surprise. "I nearly forgot I had another class. You may go. Thank you, Mr. Lupin; have a good day."Remus wriggled past an anxious looking older Ravenclaw then hurried to where his friends were waiting. He told them it was about the makeup exams he'd be taking and they all pat his back, saying how proud they were of him which made him go bright pink./\/\/\/\/\Right before supper Professor McGonagall called Peter, James, and Spinnet to her office. Sirius and Remus huddled at the end of the Gryffindor table, wondering what would happen. Sirius seemed confused over James being called in too until Remus reminded him that James had put his wand in Spinnet's face. Sirius rolled his eyes, complaining that Spinnet had deserved it."Regardless of whether he should have done it or not, it was still wrong of James," Remus said, piling curry onto his plate. "I have no regrets about setting Snape on fire, but I deserved detention for doing so."Sirius chewed thoughtfully. "We should set Snape on fire again," he said."Of course that's all you got from my statement," snorted Remus, shaking his head.They chattered for a bit then looked up when James and Peter came back in, sitting across the table from Sirius and Remus. Peter seemed pleased while James looked angry."Well?" Sirius demanded, leaning forward."Um, well, Spinnet wasn't—wasn't meaning to steal from me," Peter said.Sirius groaned. "Pete, he took your book and locked it away. That's stealing!"Peter shook his head. "No! I mean, he didn't know it was mine.""He thought it was mine," James explained grouchily. "He saw it between my bed and Pete's bed and since it's all Gryffindor-y he thought it was mine, so that's why he put it in his drawer." James slammed his hand down against the table. "He was targeting me. Told McGonsie how much I annoy him, how sick he is of all the trouble I caused. Said he didn't look inside the book, was just going to take it for a day or two then give it back. Then—oh man—then he goes, can I have detention instead of points off?" James gave a disgusted sound. "Said he knows how far behind Gryffindor is because of me and Sirius, so he'd rather just him be punished and not the entire house."Sirius rolled his eyes. "What a prig.""He stole from me because I play pranks. What a jerk.""I don't feel safe now," Sirius said, pointing his fork at James. "What if he steals again? What if he has stolen? What did McGonsie do to him?""Gave him a night of detention," sighed James. "No points taken away. Lecture about respecting property, blah-blah-blah. He said we don't respect property cause we destroy stuff, and she goes she understands but that doesn't mean he should retalate.""Retaliate?" Remus asked."Yeah, that." James jabbed at his food. "What is his problem?""Apparently us," Sirius laughed, causing James to grin."What are we gonna do to get him back?" Peter asked, and the other two fell silent. "Um, we are getting him back right?""Oh, without a DOUBT!" James hit the table again. "We need something big. Remus, you think we can enchant something to follow him around?"Remus hesitated, mid-bite. "Wh-what do you mean?""Like a big sign that says 'thief' on it or something," James said."Ooooh I love that!" Sirius said. "Giant glowing sign.""That the teachers'll probably get rid of in five seconds," Pete put in.Sirius spread his hands out. "Giant glowing sign," he just repeated."I—I'll do some research tonight," Remus promised."Don't you have the hospital thing to do?" Pete asked. "It's Tuesday, isn't it?""I do, but I need to go to the library afterwards," Remus explained."Ohhh shoot speaking of which, I have something I need to do!" Sirius jumped to his feet, cramming the rest of his sandwich into his mouth, mumbling a 'see ya' as he ran off."What's that about?" Pete asked."Probably making trouble," said Remus."Yeah, he is," laughed James. "Anyway, so the whole sign thing—if it's not perfect that's fine cause I also wanna do something similar to Snivellus soon. A sign saying 'git!' following him, or 'greasy git' or something." He quieted down for a second then let out a grunt. "Ugh, I still can't believe that jerk stole!"At about five till six Remus told James good luck with practice before heading out. He went through the halls and up staircases, everything fine and dandy, when on the third floor he got a weird feeling he was being followed. For a few seconds he wondered if it was just because of their plan of making something to stalk Spinnet but as he went down a corridor with no one else around he felt the hair on the back of his neck prickle up. He spun around, staring down the empty hallway. He stood still for a moment, trying to fixate on what was bothering him. Slowly he turned back around, heading towards the stairs, trying to listen behind him for footsteps. He thought he heard some but when he ran up the stairs and ducked down a side passage nobody came by. He waited a moment then began walking again, bringing his satchel around so he could cling to it nervously. He felt extremely uncomfortable.Someone is there, he thought, sensing a person behind him. He stopped again then whirled around, marching back the way he came. He heard quick steps and got a whiff of someone's scent. Sirius! he thought as he reached the stairs again. He just remained at the top, heart pounding. Sirius, he had definitely smelled Sirius. He must be under the cloak. Remus felt confused, then scared. He's following me.Remus wanted to say something. Only he couldn't, cause Sirius couldn't know he knew Sirius was there. What do I do?He began walking again, going back down the stairs, in a fog as he walked to the hospital wing. He couldn't go anywhere else. Obviously Sirius wanted to know if Remus was going to the hospital wing or not. Why? He felt dizzy, afraid. It felt completely out of the blue. Sirius hadn't been hounding him lately about his sickness, and now... now this?Before he reached the hospital wing he remembered some of the nearby secret corridors. He went to one of them, pulling at the torch sconce that opened up a doorway in the wall then stepped in, standing right inside the door so Sirius couldn't come in without bumping into him. He waited until the door closed up then he began running. Sirius knew where the other end let out so he had to get there, get out. He burst through the other side, running as fast as he could down the hall then into another secret corridor, rushing up the stairs, then collapsing outside the exit. He slumped down, breathing heavily, listening to any sign of Sirius.Nothing.After a couple quick gulps of air he got up, going to the classroom where Fawley was waiting. He apologized for being a few minutes late, explaining what happened since she'd most likely see it. She sat upright, fingers curling a little."He was following you?" she asked stiffly. "Why?""I-I'm not s-sure," he admitted, falling onto the couch. "He's been really... quiet about my illness ever since my fight with James." He wiped some of the sweat from his forehead, dropping his satchel onto the floor. "I don't get why he just did this.""You're certain?""Yes," he said. "I could hear the footsteps, no question about that. When I went back I could smell him. It... it was Sirius." He felt the panic bubbling up inside of him, threatening to take over."You're certain he didn't follow you here?"He bent forward, head in his hands. "I'm fairly certain however I cannot be a hundred percent positive. I think I lost him down th—the one secret passage. A... although he is going to ask me why I acted the way I did. What do I tell him?""I don't know," Fawley admitted with a light sigh. "You could tell him you felt like someone was following you and was afraid it might be one of those Slytherin boys who have bullied you in the past."Remus nodded, liking that idea. "Yeah, th—that would work. Um... I need a minute to calm down then I think I'll be ready."He emptied himself as best he could, taking in slow breaths until Fawley touched his head. He felt a little bit of a headache and this weird sort of thick feeling in his head which only lasted a second, then he was remembering one of the pranks the Marauders had done over the weekend. When the memory ended and he returned to the real world, Fawley happily told him she had to push harder than before to get into his head."You're starting to get it," she said, clapping. "I'm so pleased by this! I wasn't expecting you to be this far along this soon!"Of course he couldn't manage it again that evening despite trying as hard as he could. Fawley gave him her usual speech of not letting things get him down, reminding him he was further along than she ever thought he'd be. He still felt disappointed in himself, and as soon as he left the room the panic began welling up again. He kept his ears out as he went to the library, relieved he didn't sense anyone following him this time. He hoped Sirius would bring it up sometime soon, and if Sirius didn't then he would because he wanted to have words about this!

The atmosphere in the dorm felt extremely weird on Tuesday evening. Spinnet and Struthers were definitely keeping a distance from the Marauders, James was visibly angry with Spinnet, and Remus felt awkward around Sirius. He grew panickier as the evening drew on until finally he shut his curtains, pretending to be too tired to socialize. At around nine when the others started getting ready for bed, James and Spinnet got into a loud argument. Remus just buried his head under his pillow, pushing on the sides to block out as much of it as he could. Finally the two finished whatever they were fighting about and one by one his dormmates went to bed.Remus stayed in bed until ten, waiting until the other boys were asleep before he crept out to get a shower and prepare for bed. He couldn't get to sleep for a while after, and once he did he had nightmares. Most were low grade ones that didn't bother him too much then he had a pretty intense one that woke him up, panting heavily but thankfully not making too much noise.He got very little sleep after that, and was exhausted come morning. He rolled over when Peter tried waking him up then mumbled it was Wednesday and he didn't need to get up yet. He just went back to sleep for another couple fitful hours then threw on his uniform, trudging down to the kitchens at around ten-twenty.Charms dragged a bit since they were still working on the softening charm and Remus had it pretty much down pat, so instead he propped his Charms book up and practiced the spell to make an object track someone. It was from the third year spell book but didn't seem too difficult, just a lot of concentration on 'attaching' it to the person. He was practicing with two pieces of paper, spelling one to follow the other then sliding the first piece around. After fifteen minutes he finally managed to get the second piece to follow."Mr. Lupin?"Remus jumped looking guiltily up at Professor Flitwick. "Y-y-yes sir?" he squeaked."Are you paying attention?"He closed his book, setting it on top of the parchment. "Yes sir." He obediently spongified the large rock on his desk and rolled it off, everyone watching it bounce around. To his surprise, most the class tittered.Flitwick just smiled. "I appreciate the display however I just dismissed class."He glanced around suddenly realizing half his classmates were on their feet, the other half gathering their things. He went beet red as almost everyone began laughing. Quickly he swept everything in his satchel, jumping out of his seat, trying to crowd in close to his friends in hopes the other students would stop giving him looks."Poor Remy," Sirius laughed, messing up Remus's hair as they left.He ducked away. "I was distracted," he grumbled, smoothing his hair back down."Remus Lupin not paying attention in class?" Peter looked quite shocked."It's not like I don't have any comprehension of this spell!" he hissed out, hitching his satchel up higher on his shoulder. "All four of us are rather beyond the current class level, wouldn't you agree?"All three of them nodded but Sirius cracked a grin, throwing his arm across Remus's shoulders which sent an uncomfortable shudder through his body; he hadn't realized he was having another 'touching feels bad and makes his soul ache' sort of day until then, and wasn't sure how to get Sirius's arm off of him. He didn't want to do the same thing he did with James the other day, pretending to drop his satchel, but he needed to do something."It's still hilarious to see you not paying attention in class though," teased Sirius. "Needs to happen more often. Makes me feel less bad about doing it."Remus twisted around to put his hands on his hips so Sirius's arm fell away, making him feel a lot better. "Perhaps you should try paying attention more often?""Ugh, no!" Sirius groaned, sounding as if someone were trying to convince him to eat a vomit flavored bean."So what were you doing in class?" James asked.Remus brightened, scrabbling in his bag for a piece of parchment. He performed the spells, 'attaching' it, so to speak, to James. The paper fluttered down a bit then floated for the most part a few inches away from James who began running in circles, laughing as the parchment chased him."EXCELLENT!" he shrieked, holding up his hand for a high five which Remus reluctantly gave."I obviously have a lot to work on before we can properly do what we want to do," he sighed, removing the spell so the parchment fell to the floor. "I'm hoping we can do it before the weekend. No promises though."They trooped into the Great Hall, taking up probably more room at the Gryffindor table than four kids should. Remus immediately got out his grade 3 Charms book to study the spell some more while his friends ate. He began working on getting a napkin to follow a fork—trying to get it to follow at more of a distance—but it didn't seem to be working. He frowned, restudying the spell until his friends got his attention, needing to say his name a few times like Flitwick had in class."I asked how things went with Pomfrey last night," James said when Remus finally looked up.Remus hesitated, trying not to look at Sirius. "F—fine," he said, shutting the book. He sat up a bit straighter, deciding to go with Miss Fawley's idea. "At least, the Pomfrey part went fine.""What does that mean?" Pete asked."I—I think the Slytherins are up to something." Remus nodded intently, trying not to make it obvious he had his eye on Sirius as he said, "I was being followed."Sirius's eyes flickered just slightly but his face quickly smoothed over. "Oh?" he asked."I think it was the Slytherins," Remus continued, adding on to his lie. "I got the feeling I was being followed after I left the Great Hall but no one was behind me. I started to get worried it might be Mulciber and Avery planning something. You know, perhaps they were intending to waylay me on the way to the wing? I didn't go immediately to the hospital wing, instead I kept going up floors then I backtracked. Nobody—nobody was there, it was so odd but I still had that feeling so I went down secret passages to escape." He let out a sigh, shaking his head now. "By the time I got to the hospital wing I didn't think I was being followed anymore, thankfully. It was so weird though!""Why do you think the Slytherins were involved?" James asked, a touch too lightly. He knew what Sirius had done!Remus gave him a wide-eyed, innocent look. "Who else would do something so... so... so creepy and awful?"James and Sirius's gazes flickered very briefly at one another before they went back to their food. "You're right," Sirius agreed. "While you work on that spell we should try to come up with something to get back at them.""What does waylay mean?" Pete asked, and Remus explained it basically meant ambush. "Ooh, you're right, they probably were gonna do that." Peter's words were full of honesty, so Remus figured whatever Sirius and James were doing they hadn't talked to Peter about it.Remus froze up at that. Is this what they were talking about the other night? he wondered as his friends began discussing possible things to do to Mulciber and Avery. The secret they were keeping from Peter and Remus... was it the fact they were suspicious of Remus? Was that why Sirius was stalking him? He began to grow nauseated, glad he hadn't put any food on his plate yet because he doubted he'd be able to get anything down now. All his fears came back with a vengeance.They probably don't suspect you're a werewolf, he tried to convince himself. They wouldn't be so kind and friendly with you if they did. He figured they probably just suspected something about his health. Right? They hadn't shown any dislike...He spent the next fifteen minutes quietly panicking, half-studying the charms book until he realized they didn't have class right after lunch so there wasn't any need for him to stay. He closed the book, murmuring that he needed to go to the library. Once there he just hid out underneath one of the tables to try to calm down, erase the anxiety building up. There was every possibility they thought he was just bunking off every Tuesday night and wanted to see. Perhaps Sirius intended to follow him into the hospital wing to listen in which was a terrible violation of privacy and Remus desperately hoped that wasn't the case./\/\/\/\/\The following morning Remus felt a little better. He had convinced himself that Sirius was just being super nosy and wasn't really suspicious of any sort of lycanthropy. James and Sirius were in very good moods on Thursday too which they revealed to be due to the fact Spinnet had been acting erratically (Remus's word, not theirs, after they explained). He knew the Marauders were up to something to get back for stealing Pete's book—he just didn't know what. Or when."We should sit on the thief thing a little longer," Sirius said, drumming his fingers on the table. "Make him squirm.""I just wanna make sure he gets what he deserves," said Peter, angrily buttering a piece of toast. "I don't care that he didn't know it was mine. It really upset me!""As it should," agreed James."At least it proves he didn't read the journal," Remus said helpfully. "Since he had no idea it was yours. He stole from you, but didn't read your private stuff."Peter chewed thoughtfully, then slowly nodded. "Yeah, you're right about that. It makes me feel less... yucky. I mean, still mad though."James groaned loudly. "I really wish we didn't have to share a dorm with him."Peter glanced up, brow wrinkling. "Me too but it'd be three in one and three in another so we'd be split up. With my luck I'd be stuck with Spinnet.""Whaddaya mean bad luck?" James demanded. "You've got good luck! You ended up as my friend after all."Peter just stared at James. "Wanna shrink down that big head of yours?"Remus choked on his orange juice while Sirius began laughing so hard he couldn't breathe, tears forming in his eyes. Once his passages became clear enough Remus began laughing too. James glowered while Peter smirked, returning to his toast. Sirius reached over to give him a high five which just make James pout even more, calling them all jerks./\/\/\/\/\After their post-Herbology showers the Marauders unlocked one of the unused classrooms on the fifth floor to hang out. While Remus practiced the paper-stalking spell, James helped Peter with some Defense spells and Sirius sat in a windowsill with a sketchbook propped on his lap, hand flying away as he drew. Remus just kept attaching pieces of paper to James while he moved about, flourishing his wand, showing Peter various movements."Like this!" he stated, waving his wand. Peter tried to copy him. "No, no. You need to flick your wrist more at the end. Here, let me do this slower. Okay watch. Annnnd... hah! Like that.""This?""Almost. Here, let me show you." James went over to Peter with about half a dozen pieces of parchment fluttering after him. The two more recent ones were floating about five inches above his head which was good progress.Remus switched tactics, focusing now on protecting the paper so Spinnet couldn't simply finite incantatum and get rid of it. He had James try to get rid of the paper and unfortunately he managed. Remus frowned, scratching his head before going back to the books to try to figure out the best route."I really think the way I should go with this is a shielding spell, a small sphere around the paper that makes the spells bounce off. It will wear off eventually... but I'm not sure how else to prevent him from getting rid of the paper immediately..." He doubted the others were listening to him as he was mostly talking to himself. "The question is am I able to perform the power needed to unleash a spell that sustains itself for a decent length of time...""Could we do something to help that?" Sirius asked.Remus jumped a little bit in surprise at being shaken out of his thoughts. "Wh—what?"Sirius looked over his sketchbook. "Is there any way we could ummm... help you sustain the spell?"Remus rubbed his chin in thought which for some reason made Sirius smile. "I don't think any of us are at that level quite yet however if you put a shielding spell over mine that would prolong the life of the spell and therefore preserve the—why are you smirking?""You've got ink all over your face now," Sirius explained, holding his book up against his mouth to try to hide the fact he was laughing.Remus looked at his hand then groaned out. "How bad is it?""Let's just say I don't think you look good with a beard," Peter said sympathetically.Remus groaned even louder, searching through his bag for a handkerchief, trying to wipe himself clean then having to leave so he could go to a bathroom, feeling dumb when he saw his reflection. Ugh, ink everywhere. He washed his face until he was clean again then left to go back up to the fifth floor. He had gone down to the fourth since he wasn't a hundred percent sure where the bathrooms on the fifth were.He turned a corner, then hesitated. Great, he thought miserably. Of course.Snape was down the hallway. He had seen Remus, so there was no escaping or trying to sneak around him. Remus wiped his hands off on his trousers then moved forward, focusing on the floor so he wouldn't have to look at Snape. What is he doing up here? he wondered. It was lunch time, he should have been in the Great Hall."Loopy."Remus stopped in his tracks, slowly looking over, flinching when he saw Snape's hand near the pocket where his wand stuck out. Remus had stupidly left his wand with the other Marauders. He felt naked.Snape's lip curled back in a sneer. "Where are the others? Hmm? By yourself?""Wh—what do you want, Snivellus?"The wand came out and Remus took a step back, heart leaping into his throat. He had no way to defend himself. Snape gave a laugh. "Scared, Loopy? Or are you going to set me on fire again?"Remus swallowed, lifting his chin. He could hear footsteps coming towards them so he didn't feel quite so worried. "I d-d-don't know, are you g—going to cut me open again?""I should," he hissed as he took a step forward. "You deserve it." Then his eyes widened before quickly tucking his wand back in his pocket, facial expression going from pure hatred to one of mild annoyance."Sorry about—Remus!" It was Lily, a bag full of food on one arm. "How come you aren't down in the Great Hall?"Remus glanced at Snape then back at Lily. "We're d-doing things elsewhere. What about y—you?""Sev and I are having lunch together," she explained, coming up next to Remus, hand brushing against his arm. Remus noticed a flash of fury crossing Snape's face at that, but since Lily was looking at Remus she didn't. "Privately, since he—we don't want to upset anyone in the Great Hall."Remus raised his eyebrows at her quick change of words but didn't mention it. "Have f—fun," he said, trying to sound impassive. He wanted so bad to tell Lily that Snape had had his wand out but didn't. "I'll s-see you in Defense."He walked down the hall, close to the edge. Snape fidgeted a little as Remus passed him, shooting him a dirty look. Remus kept his head up, hands clenched at his sides until he got to the fifth floor. Only then did he slump, privately thanking the stars for Lily's very timely appearance. On the other hand... if she had taken a few extra minutes then she would have walked in on Snape attacking an unarmed Remus which would have been interesting...He shook his head then went into the classroom, deciding not to tell his friends what happened—mostly for Lily's sake./\/\/\/\/\That evening at supper Remus ate with Lily since she seemed to want to do so, which he found out why after about ten minutes of general chatter about classes. She finally cleared her throat, cheeks tinting just slightly as she told him that apparently Snape accused Remus of threatening him during their meeting earlier.Remus nearly spat out that Snape had lied, then quickly swallowed his words. Getting irritated wouldn't help him. "I d-didn't have my wand with me," he said carefully. Lily's eyes grew huge. "I left it with—with them." He jerked his head towards the other Marauders. "I had ink on my face and j-just went to clean off, and my wand was still by my notebook.""Why would Severus lie?" she asked, which was an empty question and they both knew it. Her cheeks went even redder. "Er, never mind.""We mostly just glared at each other, that's all," he said. "He—he got out his wand. But he didn't do anything."Lily squeezed his wrist. "I believe you." They continued eating in silence for a moment then Lily began stirring her soup thoughtfully. "He still thinks you lot dumped the slugs on him a while ago." Remus didn't answer. "They haven't done much to him lately, have they?""Not... particularly. That I know of," he said, prodding his baked potato, watching it fall to pieces. "They've been a little focused on Spinnet."Lily's head snapped up. "Oooh, right. The whole thing with him stealing from Pettigrew?""A—actually, as it turns out, he thought the journal belonged to James!" Remus told her, realizing he hadn't informed her of all the updates. He told her everything, including their plan of making a sign that said thief to follow him around. Lily hid her giggles behind her hand. "That's what I was practicing earlier, when I got ink on my face.""How did you get ink on your face from practicing a spell?" she inquired.Remus rolled his eyes. "I—er, well, was taking notes then—then rubbed my face. St-stop!" he whined when her giggles grew louder."S—sorrrryyy!" she wheezed out as her giggles turned to laughter. "I'm just imagining you dumping ink on your hands then—then just..." She put her hands to her face, rubbing vigorously. Remus couldn't help but laugh too, at that image."It wasn't like that!" he managed to get out. "Sirius—he, he asked me a question and I, you know..." He rubbed his chin."Just wash your face with ink," she said.Remus's eyes suddenly went big. "Ohhh that'd be a brilliant prank.""Wh—what? Oh, Remus, no, I wasn't..." she trailed off, eyes narrowing. "You know, that would be funny. Could you help me prank them?""Them?" Remus glanced at his other friends then back at Lily.. "You mean James and Sirius?""Yes! Just help me come up with a way to do the ink soap, that's all. You've got a pranking sort of mind. Please?""How are you going to get it to them?" he asked.Lily beamed. "Girls can go up the boys' stairs.""Lily!""Well come on, if there was a way into the girls' dorm you know they'd be pranking us left and right!" she said, tugging at his sleeve.That wasn't entirely true, but he couldn't tell her that without revealing they could get into the girls' dorms! Instead, he looked back over at James trying to toss bits of food into Peter's mouth while Sirius egged them on. "Okay," he sighed.Lily squealed and gave him a hug. "Yay!""It—it wouldn't be really difficult though," he said quietly. "If you w-want to do hand soap it might be, however if you intend to just get them it won't be hard because James and Sirius both use shower gel so you could probably just mix it in without having to hide it."Her eyes sparkled. "Perfect."Remus went with his friends to James's practice, figuring when James got his shower after he'd be quite inky. He felt kinda bad for 'helping' Lily (despite the fact he hadn't really done anything) and wondered how his friends would be reacting to this. He doubted they'd even suspect Lily.../\/\/\/\/\And as it turned out, they blamed Spinnet. After practice ended they returned to the school and James got his second shower of the day. Shortly after he got in he began shouting angrily then a moment later he stormed into the dorm, clutching a towel around his waist, ink dripping all over his face, and along one shoulder and arm. Remus immediately began laughing and thankfully Sirius and Peter did too."SPINNET!" James roared. Spinnet (and Struthers) were both laughing as well. James dripped water and ink on the floor as he came in farther. "I KNOW you DID THIS!""Me?" Spinnet snorted. "So what, now you're gonna blame everything on me?"James flailed his hand in front of his face. "Who ELSE would do this?!"Spinnet shrugged. "One of your friends probably, they're the pranksters.""Oi!" Sirius snapped, sitting upright. "I didn't do that! Though I wish I did.""SIRIUS!" James roared.Sirius grinned at James. "What? It's funny!"James looked at Peter who shrugged helplessly, promising he hadn't done it. Then James looked at Remus who pressed his lips thin, shaking his head slightly. He felt heat rushing to his face and more laughter threatened to bubble over. James squinted at him. "Remus," he said slowly, walking over. "Did you?!""I didn't!" Remus promised. "It's just funny to see you like that."James frowned, casting another glower at Spinnet before turning Sirius again. "Can I borrow your soap? Since mine's ruined."Sirius scrambled off his bed, giggling. "Yeah, yeah. Here." He tossed the bottle over and James stomped out of the bathroom.Remus pretended to go back to his book, waiting, wondering. Had Lily just inked James or did she ink Sirius too?"AAARRRRRGGGHHH!"In stormed James again with more ink on him. He threw Sirius's shower gel back at him. "YOU HAD INK IN YOURS TOO!""What!?" Sirius stared at the bottle then dumped some out on the floor. There was definitely ink in it. "SPINNET!""It wasn't me!" Spinnet growled. "I hate you guys but I didn't do it!"Peter and Remus were laughing so hard now then James furiously demanded they all check their stuff. Peter also used a gel which came out clean, and Remus had a cheap bar of soap which he waved at his friend, the white of the soap clearly untainted. James harumphed, took Peter's bottle, then stalked back to the showers. Remus, Sirius, and Peter all burst into more laughter.

James was super grouchy on Friday morning, grumbling to himself as they went down to breakfast, insisting that Sirius be angry too since someone attempted to ink him as well. Sirius didn't care, more amused than anything else which just made James even grouchier. In Potions class Remus paired up with Lily mostly so he could tell her what happened. She spent half the class trying to stifle giggles and whispering for Remus to try to imitate James's face over and over."Are you going to the supper tonight?" Remus asked as they left class."Slug Club?" Lily asked and he nodded. "Yes. Are you?""Um, yeah. Slughorn sorta... roped me into it...""Roped? What do you mean?""I—I wasn't going to go but he convinced me I should. Slughorn just... I don't know, I don't know why I agreed. But I did, and I-I'm not going to back out.""If you don't want to go you shouldn't," she said firmly. "I'm personally excited however you don't like being around a lot of people so it's not really your thing."He just shrugged. "I'm going to go tonight but that's it. S—since it's just second and third years I think I'll be okay."Lily gave him a hard, long look. "Think? Remus, don't push yourself.""I w-won't," he promised.But he was nervous all day, working himself into a bit of a frenzy as the evening grew closer. By the time Transfiguration came in the afternoon his skin felt uncomfortable and scrape-y, and his brain was whirring too much to pay much attention to Professor McGonagall. He was physically shaking when they got back to their dorm, keeping his hands tight to his sides so nobody else would notice. He knew he didn't have to go but he felt like if he did skip out Slughorn would merely double down on his determination to pull Remus into the Slug Club for whatever reason. He could come to the dinner then say, sorry not my thing. Hopefully.James and Remus both took showers even though Remus wasn't very sweaty or anything; still, he figured he should be as clean as possible. He returned to his dorm with an old, ratty robe wrapped tight around his body, still trembling at the thought of spending an evening with several other people in a close setting.James asked what he was wearing and that made Remus stop shaking. Made him completely freeze up. He hadn't thought of clothes at all. "Um."James perked up, running over to his wardrobe. "I was thinking you could borrow some stuff.""Oh, n—no, I—thank you but no."James brought clothes over to Remus, ignoring him completely as he held up the shirts. Sirius and Peter joined him, studying the shirts carefully, making remarks. "James, really, I-I appreciate it but—""This one," James said, dropping the other shirts."That one," Sirius agreed."Definitely!" chimed in Peter.James held a dark purple shirt and a grey plaid button-up up against Remus, nodding. "You can borrow my trousers too, if you don't want to wear your uniform," he said, pushing the shirts into Remus's arms. Without waiting for an answer he fetched a pair of very nice slacks."James—""Go try it on," James said.Remus looked at his friends, all of whom nodded encouragingly. "It'll look awesome on you," Sirius urged.Remus trudged into the bathroom to change. He did have to roll the trousers up a bit so they'd fit, and the sleeves of the plaid top went past his hands so he pushed those back as he returned to the dorm. The other Marauders all began making noises of approval and Sirius came over, unbuttoning the cuffs so he could properly roll the sleeves up, rebuttoning them to stay in place. Remus grew very warm as Sirius did that, and the panicky feelings started coming back to his stomach and chest for no apparent reason. Sirius also seemed on edge about something as his heart rate had gotten a lot faster."Looks good on you," Sirius said awkwardly, finishing fixing the cuffs."Th—thank you," Remus replied, just as awkwardly though he wasn't sure why."It looks super neat on you!" Peter said, nodding. "James, you chose good.""You can keep those shirts," James said.Remus's head snapped up. "No! N-no. I—I can't. Th-thank you but no."James adjusted the front of the plaid top then went back to his wardrobe to choose an outfit for himself. Remus sat down on his bed, looking down at the sleeves then the trousers. It felt so odd wearing James's clothes. The previous year he had borrowed a shirt for the Slug Club Christmas party but this was an entire outfit. James wasn't particularly tall or wide but the clothes were big on Remus. He sighed and went to get a belt to make sure the trousers wouldn't fall down. He might as well borrow the clothes, they looked so much better than anything he had."Shame you can't bring friends to this one," Peter sighed, flopping back onto his bed.James picked out his outfit then began stripping off right in the dorm as usual. Remus glanced away, hurrying to his own wardrobe to get some decent looking socks and vaguely okay shoes onto his feet. He brushed out his hair then stood in front of one of the mirrors. His clothes looked great, the rest of him not so much."Hey, let's go!" James said brightly, nudging Remus. They walked down to the Great Hall with Sirius and Peter then bid farewell, the two of them continuing down to the dungeons. Remus was a little shaky again though felt calmer when he saw Lily in the hall near the Potions classroom.She gave him a bright smile, running over. "You look so good!" she said, looking him up and down."You d-d-do too," he said. She was in a flowy sort of brown skirt and a cream and brown paisley tunic. She looked like an autumnal goddess. "Your hair!" he realized."Yeah, I had it grown out," she laughed, touching her hair. She still had the fringe but now her hair came in waves to her shoulders."Looks dumb," James yawned.Lily glared. "You look dumb.""Pffft!" James scoffed. "I look fantastic.""Remus looks fantastic," she argued, linking her arm with his. "Come on."James stuck his tongue out at her but she didn't notice as she led Remus into the classroom. It had been changed like the Christmas party although not as drastically. The tables were all gone except for a large round one which was set beautifully underneath a large floating chandelier. There were already a few students there. Slughorn was standing near the door, greeting the three of them, urging them to go on in and sit down.Remus was very relieved when he was able to sit between James and Lily, so he didn't have to sit next to someone he didn't know. On Lily's other side was a Hufflepuff in their year named Catchlove, and on James's other side was a Ravenclaw named Bottlebrush. They were the only second years there until Snape came in, along with a female Slytherin named Nott. Snape's eyes darted to Lily then glared at the Catchlove. After a second he sat with Nott, and two third year Slytherins. Remus wasn't really sure why Snape was so put out since he doubted Snape would have sat with Lily so publicly anyway.A moment later another girl came in and Slughorn clapped his hands, pleased everyone had made it. He took a seat between two third years. "Welcome everyone!" he said. "It's so good to see you! How about we go around the table introducing ourselves for anyone who doesn't know one another? Lucius, we'll start your direction."The blonde boy next to him gave a bored sigh and introduced himself as Lucius Malfoy. Remus remembered the bat-bogies getting caught in that long blonde hair the previous year, and he tried his best not to laugh. Next to Malfoy, Jonathon Nott, his obvious sister Abigail, then Snape. Remus began to grow terrified to even speak, regretting even attempting this. He shouldn't have come. The Ravenclaw on James's other side introduced himself, then James proudly introduced himself along with, "Of course you all know who I am. And this is Remus Lupin," he added, patting Remus's shoulder. Then Lily hesitantly introduced herself, and Remus felt himself go weak with relief. He figured James just wanted more attention on himself but he didn't care, he was so grateful for James doing that!Once the last introduction was made—a black girl named Dorcas Meadowes that Remus recognized as being from Gryffindor—Slughorn clinked his fork against his goblet to make a ringing sound. That seemed to be a signal as house-elves began appearing with platters full of food, carefully depositing them onto the table.Slughorn spoke as everyone began putting food on their plates. "I'm very glad to see everyone here. The Slug Club is a tradition that I have been doing for years, where a variety of talented and brilliant young witches and wizards can come together and bloom!" He beamed around at the handful of students around him. "All of you have been specially handpicked by me!" he added towards the second years; obviously the third years had already gotten this speech. "In the Slug Club you'll make friendships... connections! You'll meet previous members of the Slug Club, all of whom have gone very far in life! In fact you'll find quite a few high Ministry employees began right here.""Like Professor Prewett?" James asked cheerfully.Slughorn fell silent for a second. "Ah... ah, n—no, I'm afraid Fabian was never much of one for this sort of thing."Malfoy muttered something under his breath and into his goblet that even Remus barely picked up, something about blood traitors. The Nott sitting next to him snorted while Slughorn didn't seem to notice and continued talking. He spoke about opportunities, advancements, and a whole bunch of other stuff Remus began to tune out. He could tell James was getting bored too. Slughorn spoke to the students, inquiring after family members who had been in the Slug Club before."How is Monty doing?" Slughorn asked James who choked a little on his food, surprised at the question."Pretty good," he said, screwing his face up. "Dad didn't belong to the Slug Club, did he?"Slughorn laughed. "No, my dear boy, no, we went to school together. You could say we were rivals in potions in our day!""Of course you were the better," Malfoy interjected.Slughorn smiled. "Now, now, Fleamont Potter gave me quite a run for my money in many ways!""Doesn't seem like his son inherited that ability," Snape muttered, loud enough for everyone to hear.James glared at Snape but before he could say anything one of the third year Hufflepuffs asked a question, shifting the conversation. Remus returned to not paying much attention, finding that if he just pretended he was eating with James and Lily it wasn't so bad or scary. He knew he was in a small dinner but he wasn't as freaked out as he thought he would be until Slughorn began telling the third years why he had picked out the second years. So everyone was looking at him when Slughorn spoke of Remus's 'outstanding' intelligence and abilities. Remus just looked at his plate, hoping he wasn't going too red. James glowed under Slughorn's praise of his Quidditch prowess and cleverness."Not to mention the gold in his vault," Malfoy whispered to the older Nott sibling who snickered.To Remus's annoyance when Slughorn talked about Lily he mentioned the fact she was a Muggleborn multiple times, making it sound like her abilities were all the more extraordinary because she wasn't from a magical background. Lily's knuckles were white as she held onto the stem of her goblet but kept a pleasant expression.Slughorn then began talking about previous Slug Club members, bragging (for in Remus's opinion there was no other word for it) about the connections he had made throughout his career. At one point James elbowed him, jerking his chin to his own plate. Remus looked down to see the shape of a penis made out of peas, then grabbed his napkin to try to make his snort of laughter seem like a cough.The rest of the dinner went by without much interest for Remus and was relieved when Slughorn finished his dessert, saying his goodbyes to everyone, shaking hands. Except for Remus. He pat Remus's shoulder. Remus stiffened a little, feeling strangely awkward about the interaction, however remained silent, giving a faint smile towards Slughorn as he left. As soon as he left the classroom he gave a long sigh of relief."That was interesting!" Lily said as she, Remus, James, and Meadowes headed out of the dungeons. Meadowes wasn't really with them, just following at a short distance."Don't you mean boring?" James asked, turning around to walk backwards so he could look at Lily. "And rude.""Rude?" Lily asked."Yeah, I mean—maybe it was just me but come on, how rude was it when he praised you? 'For a Muggleborn you're good at this', 'For a Muggleborn you're good at that'." James rolled his eyes at Remus. "Just me? Thinking that was rude? Your blood doesn't mean anything.""I—I agree, I th-thought it was a bit rude," Remus said.Lily cocked her head to one side. "I didn't mind. It sort of felt like he was rubbing it in the faces of some of the Purebloods that I've got loads of talent without their precious background!""Brava," said Meadowes, making them all jump. She raised her eyebrows, looking at the three of them. "I agree with the boys that it was rather irritating of Professor Slughorn for some of how he phrased things, however I agree with you that it was nice that he reminded some of the Purebloods that 'despite'—" here she did air quotes, "—your blood status you're as—if not more—talented than them."Lily beamed while James scowled. "Thank you. Um, Meadowes, right?""Yes." Meadowes took a few quick steps so she could shake Lily's hand. "It's nice to meet you. Evans?""Yes. Are you the only third year Gryffindor in the Slug Club?"Lily slowed so she could walk with Meadowes, talking to her, asking her questions. James and Remus walked ahead of them, chattering about their own things (mostly James making fun of the Slytherins) until Lily decided she had something else to say to them. "Potter!"He groaned then turned. "What?"Lily gave him a sharp look. "I forgot to say, speaking of rudeness it was very rude of you to introduce Remus at the table instead of letting him do it!"James looked genuinely taken aback. "What?" He looked at Remus then back at Lily. "Why was that rude?"Lily rolled her eyes. "He can introduce himself. You shouldn't speak for him."Remus was about to say that he hadn't minded but James just rolled right in, shocking Remus. His assumption of James doing that just to keep the attention on himself apparently wasn't the reason. James slung an arm around Remus and said, "You should know how difficult it is for Remus to talk in front of people he doesn't know, how anxious he gets unless it's a big nerdy speech about school stuff."Remus felt a glow of warmth inside for James thinking of him. Lily frowned at Remus who grew a little pink. "I—I'm g-glad he d—did," he admitted. He didn't like taking sides when it came to James versus Lily but this time he had to. "I r-really appreciated it. I was really... panicking when the introductions were—were getting c-closer to me."James squeezed Remus gently then let go. "I thought you were.""Well... it was still rude," Lily sniffled, visibly upset she hadn't realized."So?" James adjusted his glasses. "I still think what Sluggy did was rude."Lily didn't have much to say to that so James whirled back around, striding off. Remus hesitated, then waited for Lily. She murmured an apology about not realizing how upset he had been during the dinner and he promised her it was okay. "It m-makes me relieved I was able to—to hide it." He gave her arm a pat to assure her it was fine then he hurried back to James who put his arm back around Remus as they walked back to dorm where James told the other Marauders everything while Remus disappeared under his bed to curl up with his pillow, wishing it was Gwyllgi but not wanting to get him out in front of the others./\/\/\/\/\Saturday definitely made up for the dinner. James's morning practice was super early but they all got up anyway, taking their breakfast to the bleachers to watch James while they ate. When they returned to the dorm they found James had had a pretty big mail call: their Muskateer costumes had arrived from his parents!They all tried on the outfits with great pleasure. Remus was shocked at how good his fit! The black leggings weren't too loose or too tight, the shiny black boots felt really nice on his feet, the white undershirt was loose but it was supposed to be billowy, and the blue and white tabard hung at the perfect length. They all had the hats with feathers, and even fake twirly mustaches. The best part was, of course, the fake swords which caused James and Sirius to immediately start fighting one another.While they did Peter took all four mustaches and stuck them to his face. "Pete, I mustache you a question," Remus said sending Peter falling to the floor with peals of laughter."Best costume idea ever!" James proclaimed once he shoved his sword between Sirius's arm and his body, sending Sirius into a dizzying death spin until he collapsed dramatically onto the floor.After lunch they took all their Babbling Brew supplies to the pit-passages, James flying everyone over (Remus sweating a little when he had to go). They chose a few pits back to do their potion, just for extra security, and while they waited for the water to boil James tried to talk Remus into getting on his back for a piggyback ride; at first Remus declined since he wasn't completely okay with touch but finally James convinced him. It wasn't as awful as Remus expected. James galloped around while Remus clung to him, laughing. Remus was happy that Peter took some pictures since they were all having a great day and he liked pictures of days like this, for him to remember better.Soon they got onto the subject of middle names, since Peter started flipping through his history book and eventually said, "If I ever manage to do anything interesting it's gonna going to end up like one of these boring names.""Whaddaya mean?" James asked, whirling in a circle, making Remus dizzy.Peter sighed. "My name is so boring! My full name is just this... yawn! If I manage to get into a history book somehow my name is going to be one nobody can remember cause it's just bleeegh.""Your middle name?" Sirius asked, looking up from his sketchbook curiously."Yes! At least some of these people have interesting names but my whole name is boring. I mean come on, Peter Pettigrew?""James Potter isn't much more interesting," James said, hitching Remus up higher on his back. "Though I guess my middle name gives me a bit more of a flair.""What's your middle name?" Pete asked.James grinned. "Fleamont. It's a sort've Potter tradition, giving our sons our names for their middle names.""James Fleamont Potter!" Sirius laughed, falling over. "I love it."James stuck his tongue out. "What's yours, Petey-boy?""It can't be more boring than my middle name," Remus said before Pete answered.Peter sighed. "No, it is. It's Laurence. Come on. Peter Laurence Pettigrew.""My middle name is more boring," Remus said with a shrug."How is that possible?"Remus smiled. "John.""What? Really?" James looked up at him. "Remus John Lupin? John?""Yup.""That's opposite my name," James said. "I've got a bland first and last name, with a weird middle name."Remus snorted. "Thanks for calling my name weird." He knew perfectly well that's not what James meant, but he had to tease his friend."Nooo!" James yelped out. "I didn't mean it like that! I meant interesting. I like the name Remus. It's a good name. I'm sorry."Remus laughed. "It's fine." He didn't want to say how touchy he really was about his name. He liked it for the most part, and would have been completely fine if it wasn't for the fact he was a werewolf!Peter looked over at Sirius. "What about you?"Sirius was back in his sketchbook, studying the paper carefully as he drew. "Orion. Also my father's name. Anyone say anything about my belt and—""You'll belt us?" Remus asked, giggling when Sirius gave him one of the glaringest glares."I thought your middle name was Jirius anyway," Sirius said making Remus laugh so hard he almost fell off James and would have if James didn't have such a good hold on him, then he and Sirius had to explain what was so funny.By that point the water was at the right temperature so James deposited Remus onto the floor (which was good since he was at the edge of being okay with being touched) then he and Peter worked on the potion while Remus sat next to Sirius. Sirius tilted his sketchbook away, shielding the view from Remus. He hadn't intended on looking at whatever Sirius was drawing but it still stung slightly. He got his book from his bag, affecting not to care.After another forty minutes the potion was in the state it needed to be to be left alone for a few days so they gathered all their stuff and headed out, returning to the fourth floor then heading to their dorm, excited about how the Halloween feast might go with this potion snuck into the food. It was going to be very easy to sneak the potion in with the invisibility cloak until Remus brought up the possibility that house-elves could see through the cloak."Their magic is very different from ours," he continued. "They can Apparate around Hogwarts where Apparition does not work."The others cast worried glances then James fetched his cloak. "Let's test the theory then. No time like the present!"He and Sirius hid under the cloak, following Remus and Peter down to the kitchens. They went in and Remus and Peter talked to Toggle (the head elf in the kitchen) while James and Sirius wandered around. Once they all left (Remus and Peter with a basket full of food as they were both well beloved by the house-elves) they ducked into a nearby bathroom. James tore the cloak off while Sirius explained it didn't seem like the elves could see them. He said they had purposely gotten in the way of the house-elves who would continue going towards them. James said he waved his hand in front of one of the elves and she had seemed a little confused by the breeze but definitely hadn't reacted to the movement itself."Perfect," James said, folding his cloak up carefully. "This is going to make pulling kitchen-related pranks so much easier."

At supper Saturday night Professor Prewett made an announcement. He was pleased to inform the second years an opportunity for some extra credit had arisen, and if they wished to take this to please meet him in the eastern entrance courtyard the next day at ten am. This was only a mild surprise, since he had made a similar announcement not too long ago for the sixth years and had explained there'd be opportunities for each year throughout the school year.That got the hall buzzing. Remus knew immediately he'd be doing this, even though he didn't really need extra credit. Peter said he would too, and James and Sirius both rang in with the fact they'd go too. Remus was a little startled since doing extra schoolwork seemed odd for them then they explained it was probably something to do with dueling so of course they'd be going. Remus smiled. Of course. He refrained from saying he didn't think it would be dueling—that seemed like something better suited towards class, or at least later in the day than morning. Still, he wasn't sure what it would be.The next morning found quite a few second years gathered in the courtyard. James complained bitterly about the fact all houses would be doing this together, so they had to deal with Slytherins. There were only a couple of Slytherins. Unfortunately Snape was one of them, hovering a few feet away from Lily like some sort of miserable vulture. Silverlocke was there too, chatting with the only other Slytherin who had come: a nervous looking girl whose surname Remus thought might be Allen or something close to it. There were quite a few Ravenclaws (the biggest group), a fair amount of Hufflepuffs, and seven Gryffindors. Besides the Marauders there was Lily, Colgate, and Nettle.At ten exactly Professor Prewett strode into the courtyard, smiling broadly at the group. "Good morning everyone!" he exclaimed cheerfully. "I'm sure you're all wondering what we're doing here. Well it seems a small infestation of ignis lepus has occurred nearby in the woods. Does anyone know what those are?" A few hands raised, Remus's included. Prewett called on a Hufflepuff who replied they were commonly called pyrabbits. Prewett nodded. "They're a class three-X beast. Can anyone tell me why we need to take care of them?""They're gonna burn the forest down?" suggested a Ravenclaw.Prewett smiled. "Not quite, although close. Left alone, pyrabbits are perfectly fine. However these are nesting rather close to Hogwarts and in their search for food there is a likely chance of them going into coming here and starting fires. A fire had started in Hagrid's garden the other day. I've offered to relocate these animals for Albus, and thought I would bring you along to show you how to deal with these creatures, hands on. We will be meeting w—""We're going into the Forbidden Forest?" James interrupted him. A few other students snickered."Yes, Mr. Potter," Prewett said. "We won't be alone. Hagrid will be coming with us to make sure you lot stay close. And we won't be going deep into the woods. Now, let's go."He guided them down towards the edge of the forest, near Hagrid's hut. He was waiting for them with Rocky who barked, immediately bounding over to Remus nearly knocking him over. Remus pat his head, screwing his face up as Rocky gave him slobbering licks. Prewett guided the group into the forest with Hagrid taking up the rear. As they walked, Professor Prewett talked about pyrabbits which Remus listened to so intently to he wasn't really paying much attention to where they were, or what was going on until suddenly there was a choked scream right in front of him.James jerked back, crashing into Peter who put his arms around him to catch him. All the other students had stopped and were looking at him. Rocky stepped forward, nuzzling his hand trying to comfort him. James was staring in absolute shock and Remus followed his gaze, almost jumping as well. Several yards away was a pen full of the skeleton-horse-dragon things that pulled the carriages for Hogwarts.Had James... seen it...?Remus felt a little dazed. He had assumed before now that he was the only one who could because he was part animal. Or crazy. But James was pointing at it, stammering out a demand to know what the hell it was!"Is this the first time you've seen one?" Prewett asked, a little surprised."YES!" James screamed. "I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE HOW WAS I EVER SUPPOSED TO SEE THEM BEFORE?!""See what?" Sirius asked.James gaped at him. "THOSE—THINGS!""What things?""STOP PULLING MY LEG!" James looked back at the creatures, shaking harder now."I—I don't see anything!" Sirius looked at the pen then at Pete and Remus."I don't either," Peter admitted.Before Remus could say he did, the Slytherin girl had pushed her way through the knot of students to stand in front of James. "You can see them too?" she asked, rather amazed. "I thought I-I was crazy or something.""I thought I was the only one, too!" Pierce suddenly said and Remus was now completely shaken up. This made no sense. Others could see them? James could see them?! But... he hadn't seemed to be able to see them when they got off the train at the beginning of the year."Wait a MINUTE!" Prewett bellowed, holding up a hand. "You're telling me nobody ever explained these creatures to you?!""Sir, what creatures?" asked Craft in a snobby voice. "There's nothing there! It's an empty pen!"Several students nodded in agreement while James glared. "It isn't empty at all, you dumb bird!"That set off loud a loud argument between Craft and James until Prewett stuck his fingers in his mouth, letting out a piercing whistle, causing a ripple of irritated sounds from the creatures. "Be quiet!" he said, though since his whistle had silenced both boys it was a rather moot thing to say. "Mr. Craft, this pen is not empty. Inside are creatures called thestrals."The word churned through Remus's mind. All he knew about them was a brief line from Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them. A rare breed of winged horse who had the ability of invisibility as well as being considered highly unlucky. That's all it said. Invisible sorta made sense except why could a few kids see them but most of them not?"I don't know what ta say 'bout this," Hagrid said, shaking his head. "I 'spect the prefects bin lackin' in their duties." He went over to the pen, stroking the bony head of one the thestrals.Prewett grimaced. "I see. From my understanding, prefects are supposed to be on the lookout for students who react to these beings," he explained to the second years. "These are the creatures who pull the carriages to and from Hogwarts, so typically when students are getting off the train to come to school one of the duties of a prefect is to keep an eye out for any student who might suddenly be able to see these beings, to explain to them.""Nobody explained them to me!" Pierce snapped. "I was scared!""She was really upset," explained another Hufflepuff girl, nodding. "She kept saying don't you see them but none of us could. We thought she was just really tired or something.""I'm very sorry," Prewett sighed. "I'll have a talk with the headmaster about making sure the prefects fulfill their duties.""I—I didn't see them though!" James said, distressed. "When we came back. I didn't see them! But I do—I do now?""Professor, how is it some can see thestrals but others cannot?" Silverlocke asked, giving anxious glances at the Slytherin girl next to him."All right... first of all, how many here can see them?" Four students raised their hands. James, Pierce, the Slytherin girl, and Remus."WHAT?" James whirled on Remus, furious. "YOU CAN SEE THEM TOO?!""Y—yes," he whispered, cringing back slightly. "I... thought I was crazy too, b-before this. I didn't—didn't know anyone else c-c-could see them."Prewett cleared his throat to regain attention. "None of you know anything about them? All four shook their heads. Prewett pursed his lips a little as he obviously tried to figure out how to explain. "First of all, a lot of wizarding society view thestrals as harbingers of bad luck, or omens of bad luck. This is not true. Thestrals are terrific creatures." He was putting off explaining, and Remus could tell. "The issue with thestrals is that..." Prewett now looked at the animals, not looking at the children waiting for clarification. "Only those who have seen death can see them."There were quite a few gasps from the entire group of second years. James began trembling slightly, taking a step closer to Sirius who put a hand on his shoulder."Although that is not entirely the only reason," Prewett continued. "You not only need to have seen death but... have come to terms with it. Mr. Potter, were you present when your grandfather passed away this summer?""Y... yes," James forced out, grabbing Sirius's hand.Professor Prewett's voice became gentle as he said, "My guess is you were still trying to deal with it when school began, but since then you've accepted it."Remus remembered after their fight. James sobbing into him. He reached over and took James's other hand, squeezing gently."I was there when my cousin died," Pierce suddenly said. "It was a car wreck, three years ago. I was in it too." She then fell silent, awkward now. Her friend put an arm around her."I saw my grandmother," said the Slytherin girl.Everyone seemed to expect Remus to say something but he didn't know what to say. Who to say. "I d-d-don't really w-want to talk about it," he finally said. Peter pat his back, hand tight on his shoulder, while Remus tried to figure out who on earth he had seen die. He was never around anyone ever since he was bitten, and he couldn't remember anything before he was bitten except for a few vague memories, mostly of feelings. None that seemed connected to death.Prewett began talking about thestrals which normally Remus would have paid close attention to but all he could think about was who?! How could he see thestrals? If it was merely accepting death then he could understand that. He had known for a very long time that if he was caught he could very well be killed. If anyone found out, the Ministry would just put him down. Execute him. While death terrified him, he had accepted ages ago that it was a possibility for him. Which, in retrospect, was probably not something a small child should be accepting but his circumstances made him an unusual child. However seeing someone die? That made no sense whatsoever to him.He was still in a daze when they continued heading into the forest. Prewett started talking a bit more about the pyrabbits but it was very clear the thestral thing had taken over the whole thing. Everyone just wanted to talk to them and had no interest in the razed clearing they came to. Nothing was burning, though there was a pile of burnt wood in the very middle, and a few pyrabbits hopping about. They were about the size of a cottontail though grey-black in color as if they had been burnt. Their feet made sizzling sounds wherever they hopped though no fires started.Prewett shot out a gentle stunning spell on one of the pyrabbits, and the others were startled, hightailing it into their den, leaving little fires in their wake. Since the place was burnt anyway the fires just sorta sizzled out."Anyone know how we catch them?" he asked as he went into the clearing. Prewett called on a Ravenclaw who answered that they were attracted by charcoal. "Yes. I have a lot of charcoal here, and a cage." He pulled a tiny cage out of one pocket. He tapped it with his wand and it grew to quite a big size. Then he took out a bag, dumping bits of charcoal into one side of the cage. It was a funnel type, where the pyrabbits would go into one side and be unable to escape. As he worked, Prewett talked about the creatures, explaining how they really only started actual fires when they were around humans. Left alone, they weren't a very explicitly dangerous beast, but because they were so close to the school it wasn't safe.Then he put gloves on before carefully picking up the stunned pyrabbit, bringing it over for the students to examine closely. It smelled like burnt meat and Remus shuddered slightly, remembering the previous year when he had burned himself so badly a lot of his flesh had come off. He rubbed the inflicted arm anxiously. Of course with his healing ability it had been all fixed up in only a few hours but it still had hurt a lot at the time. Prewett showed the bottoms of the feet which had the same bright red color as a match head. He talked about their physiology, history, habits, then carefully lay the pyrabbit near the entrance to the den."I'll be coming back here regularly to empty the cage and take the captured ones deeper into the woods. I don't want to just take this one since it can't survive very well by itself," he explained. He answered any questions they had then they headed back to Hogwarts. Once they passed by the thestral pen again Remus grew nervous. James edged closer to Remus then reached out for his hand."You can really see them?" he asked."Yes. Remember Christmas? Wh—when I was scared?"Peter's mouth formed a big O. "You kept pointing and saying something about seeing—er, something!"Remus nodded. "I saw them.""We thought you had just gone weird, mate," Sirius said, forehead wrinkling. "We should have actually listened to you.""S'all right," Remus muttered, not too bothered. "I'm j-just glad I know what's going on."James held Remus's hand the rest of the way out of the woods, back to the school where Prewett dismissed everyone except the four who could see the thestrals. Remus didn't want to stay any longer but obediently stood next to James, only half listening as Prewett apologized for the sensitive issue that had come up, he hoped everyone was all right, and if they needed anything he was there and he knew their Heads of Houses would be there for them as well.Remus considered staying behind longer to ask about his issue, but he didn't really want to bring it up. He left with James, meeting up with the other Marauders—or intending to. Lily caught up with him, tapping his shoulder. She wanted to talk about the thestrals, after she expressed her grief for his loss."If you want to talk about anything, I'm here for you," she said."Are you here for me too, Evans?" James asked, fluttering his eyelashes."I'd rather eat dirt," she replied immediately."That can be arranged," James retorted.Lily just smiled. "Like you ate worms?"James's nostrils flared slightly, visibly embarrassed at the memory. Lily turned back to Remus who told her he'd just talk to her later. He really didn't want to discuss what happened right now! But of course as soon as the Marauders hid themselves away in an unused classroom Sirius and Peter wanted to. James was willing, explaining what the thestrals looked like, how odd it made him feel knowing he could see them because of what happened over the summer. They questioned Remus's ability to see them but he just repeated he didn't want to talk about it."Not even with us?" Sirius asked, sounding a bit hurt.Remus shook his head. "S—sorry," he mumbled, sitting on the floor, hugging his knees. He considered writing to his parents, asking if he had been around anyone who died back when he was a toddler... but it was such an odd question he didn't want to upset them, or make them wonder too much. Because if he hadn't then how come he could see thestrals? I have to have, he thought as the others kept talking, their words going over his head. I need to do research."Where you going?" Pete asked when Remus got up."Library," he replied as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. "Research," he added."Aw, c'mon, you can research later!" Sirius stretched his legs out, grinning at Remus. "We're hanging out. Stay, please."Remus hesitated. Sirius looked so earnest that he was tempted. On the other hand, he was aching to try and figure out an answer to what was going on. "How about I go check out some books then come back? I—I can bring some food too."They loved that idea so he left, heading first to the library to check out three books containing information about thestrals then going to the kitchen, taking a basket full of food back to the room where he found the floor spongified and his friends bouncing around."Should have never taught you that spell," joked Remus as he set the basket down in an area that was still stone."One of the best spells ever!" James laughed."Besides if you hadn't taught us, Flitty would have," added Sirius.While Remus studied, James and Peter were trying to time their bounces to 'mega' bounce each other but they kept failing; Peter's legs kept buckling and he'd flop off in a random direction. Sirius was trying to do flips. Remus watched him with worry, waiting for him to come down the wrong way off the spongified area and break his neck. After a couple minutes it nearly happened."Wingardium leviosa!" Remus flicked his wand as quickly as he could, knowing he wasn't strong enough to levitate an entire person yet however he aimed for Sirius's shirt and he was jerked around enough that he came down on his butt instead, painfully on the hard stone."What did you do that for?!" Sirius complained as his shirt kept jerking, trying to float."You were about to break your neck, you absolute almond!" Remus snapped right back, trying to come up with a decent insult which didn't really work."Almond?" Sirius laughed. "Okay. Can you take the charm off my sh—" He flailed as his shirt finally yanked well above his head. Part of it was still on him however a lot of his stomach and back were revealed. Remus removed the spell and Sirius yanked the shirt back down, cheeks going slightly pink, looking more amused than annoyed thankfully."S—sorry!" Remus laughed as Sirius began smoothing his hair back down, sticking his tongue out at Remus."Were those scars?" Pete asked, clearly not intending to be offensive but Sirius's entire face went red now."No!" Sirius stood up, adjusting his shirt."Ohh. Okay, sorry, I just thought they looked like scars and was wondering how you got them," Peter said."But you only really get scars when it's dark magic—" began James, but Sirius interrupted furiously with, "They weren't scars!" He continued jerking down on his shirt, taking a few steps away from Peter who began frowning.Remus shrank back a little, his left arm hurting where his werewolf bite scar was. James was right. Magic healed up most things pretty well, and the only things that typically left scars or permanent issues were from dark magic. Or creatures. "I'm s-s-sorry," he stammered out, feeling guilty for being the reason this started. He just wanted to try to prevent Sirius from breaking his neck or... worse, if his neck had snapped."Not your fault." Sirius finally stopped messing with his shirt then sat down on the non-bouncy part of the room next to Remus, taking a container of crisps out of the basket."I'm sorry too," Pete said nervously. "I—I just... well, I'm sorry."Sirius studied one of the crisps. "It's fine," he mumbled, tossing the fried potato into his mouth.The other two came over to eat as well, Peter changing the topic to something lighter. Sirius joined in with the conversation however it was clear he was still uncomfortable. He kept tugging at his shirt in a manner that reminded Remus of... well, Remus. If he does have scars, how did he get them?Remus tore off a piece of his sandwich, wanting so bad to talk to Sirius, to see what was going on. But Sirius totally freaked out over them even mentioning the scars, so it was something he didn't want to discuss. The question was, should he? He really didn't know. It had been an emotionally draining day that gave him a headache already with the whole thestral thing, he didn't really want a confrontation, didn't want to push him, didn't want to risk another stupid fight with his friends. He had decided before that he was probably imagining things... then he thought back to when Professor Dumbledore accused Lyall of abusing Remus. Remus insisted it wasn't, because it wasn't, but—but Sirius was a human, not a werewolf, so if his parents were hurting him that—that was abuse. But why would anyone do dark magic on their own child? Perhaps the scars were from something else entirely? Except he said that thing to Regulus a couple weeks ago... insinuating his parents were... hexing him... and if they were doing really nasty hexes on him they could leave scars but was that actually what was going on? Sirius despised his family... but he—he seemed so happy and outgoing.I'm going to talk to him about it, he decided.Except later in the day when he had a moment to speak with Sirius privately it didn't go at all like he expected. He pulled Sirius aside and said, "I really—I don't... umm...""You okay there, bud?" Sirius laughed."Y—yes. Um, no—I mean, I am." Remus flushed a little, feeling super awkward now. "I was... I was wondering something. It's kinda personal though so—um..."For some reason Sirius's heart rate started going a lot faster at that. "Yeah?"Now Remus didn't know how to ask, how to explain himself. It seemed utterly ridiculous to ask, do you have scars? Did your parents give them to you? Do they hex you? Did they let you have a broken arm for two weeks? Faced with the moment of asking, Remus realized he couldn't. If he was off the broom with this then Sirius would probably hate him. He remembered how hurt and angry he felt towards Dumbledore and Fawley for their accusations against his father, it'd be so much worse since it was beyond just 'did your father hit you'. Sirius didn't seem like he loved his parents like Remus did with his but—but they were still his parents. Looking up into Sirius's eyes he knew it'd be wrong to ask."N—never mind.""Um.""It's nothing."Sirius raised his eyebrows. He was giving off some sort of scent Remus couldn't place. Actually, he seemed a little excited about something. "You can tell me anything, Remy. We're friends."He couldn't. He couldn't. "Um—wh—what are your absolutely favorite colors?" he blurted out.Sirius literally took a step back from surprise. "Favorite colors?""Yeah. If—if you got something like—like a hat or something for your birthday."He seemed extremely disappointed which upset Remus. "Oh. Gryffindor colors." No, he wasn't imagining it, Sirius was definitely disappointed. "Is that really all you wanted to know?""Yeah.""Oh, okay."Remus felt Sirius's curious eyes on him for the rest of the day.

Remus began doing as much research into thestrals as possible, determined to find an answer as to why he could see them. He wrote down every bit of information that he found, forming his own little notebook, scribbling down theories although only one made sense: he wasn't human. Perhaps animals could see thestrals? After all, most animals wouldn't be able to 'come to term' with death. He tried to find out if animals could but there wasn't any research into that which frustrated him.I should talk to someone, he decided Monday morning as he got ready for the day, not even paying attention as he dressed himself. Prewett? McGonagall? Fawley? He sorta wanted to try to actually talk to Hagrid but Hagrid didn't know he was a werewolf. Perhaps Flitwick? He suspected Flitwick wasn't 100% human, though that his Charms teacher had some goblin blood in him. But would that be rude? He shouldn't go and say 'I think you aren't completely human either so can we talk about this?'. Course goblins were classified as beings whereas werewolves were beasts so it would be extremely rude of him."... REMUS!"Remus jumped about fifty feet, spinning around. "Wh-what?" he squeaked.Sirius looked highly amused. You're still wearing your pajama bottoms."Remus looked down. He had his shirt, tie, vest, socks, shoes, and robes all on... and then his ratty blue plaid pajama bottoms. He burned with embarrassment, grabbing his trousers so he could change behind his curtains. Dressed properly now, he grabbed his satchel and followed his friends down to the Great Hall. He was still distracted by the time they got to Potions, only coming out of it when Slughorn began pairing students up. Peter was almost immediately paired with the Slytherin girl who could see thestrals, whose surname was actually Alexander. Sirius was put with Lily, which made them both groan. Remus's stomach dropped when James was put with Nettle, then Silverlocke with Twycross. That meant he wouldn't be getting one of his friends. He began to grow a little sweaty and—"Mr. Lupin, with Mr. Snape."Remus flinched back as if Slughorn had hit him with a spell. He glanced over to Snape who looked revolted. The last time Slughorn attempted to pair the two of them together had ended in disaster: Snape had called Remus disease-ridden and wound up in a fight with Sirius.Snape wasn't moving so Remus took his stuff over, stomach flipping around as he waited for Snape's protests. They didn't come. Snape just scootched to the side so there would be plenty of room between them. "Loopy," he spat out of the corner of his mouth.It was on the tip of Remus's tongue to give a tart response back then decided to keep his mouth shut. He sat stiff, watching Slughorn until the last two students were paired off and they could begin working on their Potion."I will do all the work," Snape said immediately before Remus could even move. "You will merely mess it up. Turn it to your typical ruined mess."A vast array of possible responses churned through his mind. He went with, "No."Snape stared in disbelief. "Excuse me?""No exc—excuses for you," Remus snapped back. Snape's nostrils flared and Remus held his shoulders back. "I shan't sit here and do—d-do n—no work. It's ridiculous.""You'll get us a P, or a D!" Snape hissed.Remus brushed his hair back, giving Snape a glare. "If you're as g—good as you insist you are then that—that should be q-quite an accomplishment even f-for me!""Don't drag me down, Loopy. I'd have thought you'd be grateful to sit back and do nothing and get your best Potions grade ever."Remus clenched his teeth. "I'd ra-rather do work and get a-an A than do n—no work and get—g-get an O!""Obviously talking is difficult for you so do us both a favor and don't." Snape yanked his book out from his bag, flipping through. He had loads of notes in the margins."L-l-like it or not we are a—a team," Remus said. Snape ignored him, setting his book down on the desk, pressing his hands against the pages, attempting to make it lay flat which it wouldn't do. Remus pulled out his wand. "Gwastedium!""What did you do?" Snape growled as the book lay perfectly flat, the pages remaining still.Remus tucked his wand away. "Shall I re-r-remove it?""What was that spell?""One of m—my own," he replied rather haughtily."You can't just go around inventing spells.""Why n-not?" Remus inquired as innocently as he could. "You do." He didn't completely have a hundred percent evidence on that, but since that tongue spell Snape had used was unknown to even Pomfrey...Snape sneered at the book laying flat then sneered at Remus. "Professor." His hand shot up. "Loop—Lupin is using spells."Slughorn gave Remus a long look. "No spells in Potions class, Mr. Lupin."Remus removed the spell from the book, trying not to smirk as the book sprang back to its previous state, the pages flipping wildly. "At l—least allow me t-to read the instructions. L-let me do something!"Snape gave him an oily smile. "Very well." He took the cauldron, handing it over. "Fill this."Remus gave a growl but took the cauldron to the back of the room to fill up to the correct height. Sirius hurried over to fill his up too next to him. "Shall I hex him?" Sirius whispered."Perhaps later," he sighed. "He's already making me so angry. He won't let me do anything."Sirius's eyebrows arched high. "Are you even surprised?""No. Is working with Lily going well?""Ehhh." He shrugged. "She's not as awful as Snape. Good luck," he added, patting Remus's shoulder as Remus hauled the cauldron back. He could easily carry the weight however it was awkward to do so with the large cauldron against his body. He managed to get the cauldron back onto the desk on his own since Snape clearly wasn't going to help him.Snape began working, not allowing Remus to see the book so Remus just pulled out his own book and began prepping some of the other ingredients. Snape looked absolutely livid and slid over in his seat which meant Remus either had to be uncomfortably close to Snape or else move farther from the cauldron."Are you twelve or f—five?" Remus demanded, moving just an inch. Snape moved closer. "Merlin's sake." He grabbed a handful of sliced reeds, reaching over to put them in the cauldron."Are you mental!?" Snape grabbed his wrist, twisting his arm back in a very quick, very painful manner. Remus gave a small cry, dropping the reeds onto the floor. "You had too many and they were not sliced correctly! Too thin! No wonder you barely pull an A!""Let me do something!" he complained as he managed to get his arm free. His shoulder hurt really bad for a moment until the pain began fading. He wondered if Snape had seriously injured him, unable to know for sure due to his healing. "And what d—does it matter if they're sliced t-too thin? It's th—the same amount."Snape looked as though he might explode on the spot. "You are an idiot. How do you manage anything? Slicing too thin alters the magical properties. You know, I always thought Pokey was the moron in your group, now I believe it's you. At least he's able to manage the most simple of potions!" Snape furiously began chopping some leaves up. "And he's not sick.""Not this again," grumbled Remus, carefully counting out hefklork eggs. Snape swatted his hand away. "For someone who th—thinks I'm so diseased you sure are t-touching me a lot."Snape looked at his hand then went to the back of the room to wash his hands. While he was gone Remus quickly added the eggs. He didn't care about a lesser grade! No, that wasn't quite right. He wanted a good grade. He just wanted to earn his grade. Not let Snivellus do everything."WHAT DID YOU DO?!" Snape roared when he returned to the table to see the potion had turned into a murky sort of grey-green bogey color.Slughorn waddled over from the other side of the room. "Mr. Snape, what seems to be the pro—oh." He looked into the cauldron with faint disgust. "What happened here? Did you remember to press the hefklork eggs?""I did not add the eggs at all!" Snape exclaimed. "Loopy put them in while my back was turned for five seconds! He can NOT be trusted with potions! He shouldn't be permitted to come into this classroom period!"Remus frowned as several snickers went through the room. "I p-pressed them," he mumbled, though he knew he hadn't really done as good a job due to wanting to get the eggs in before Snape returned. He had been hasty and perhaps didn't press as much as he ought to have done. But Snape was overreacting."Professor, if I balance the misused eggs with an extra half ounce of ground lavender...?" Snape inquired.Slughorn twiddled at the end of his mustache. "Hrrm... that would counteract the eggs fairly well. It won't be as good as it should be however I do think—yes—it will save it as best as it can be saved. Good thinking, Mr. Snape; ten points to Slytherin."As soon as Slughorn left, Snape twisted around and bent in close. "You touch this one more time and I will dump the boiling liquid onto you, you diseased little brat, and with as terrible as you are in this class I doubt anyone would think it wasn't an accident of yours!"Remus spent the rest of the class sitting on the edge of the bench with his arms folded, staring blankly at the cauldron as Snape worked. He hated to admit how brilliant Snape was at potions and in fact somehow managed to completely fix the potion almost entirely. It was only a shade off color when Slughorn came around. He praised Snape's efforts, awarding him ten more points as well as an O, and Remus with an E, one of the best Potions grade ever but it felt extremely bitter.Remus angrily gathered his stuff and stormed out of the classroom, humiliated he had done nothing but screw the potion up, furious about the things Snape had said and done. He began pacing in the hallway, waiting for his friends, shooting a glower at Snape when he walked by."At least I managed to salvage your mistake which is quite a miracle!" Snape said. "Why would you even do such a thing? You are genuinely mentally unhinged! You should be locked away in Saint Mungo's, for everyone's safety!"Remus sucked in some air, wanting nothing more than to hit Snape with a hex. Do something big. Instead he merely grit his teeth and returned to pacing. Soon Peter came out who immediately went over to hug Remus."Are you okay?" he asked, stepping back, keeping his hands on Remus's shoulders."No!" he snarled, causing Peter to wince. "He—humiliated—me!"James emerged, pushing past Nettle to hurry over, hand against Remus's back. "What happened?" he asked."I hate him!" Remus felt his nose itching and for the first time in a while he began to grow teary-eyed around his friends. He ducked his head so his fringe fell across his eyes to try to hide. "I hate him so much!""Remy, you're shaking," James whispered, rubbing Remus's back.He looked down at his trembling hands, a few tears dripping down. Locked away for everyone's safety. Even though Snape meant it in a different way than Dedenne had said, it was still the same thing, the same knife carving out his chest. "He's horrible."Sirius burst out of the room. "What's the revenge plan?" he asked immediately. "I mean, we are doing something, right?""Hell yes we are!" James said."Revenge?" Lily was behind Sirius, hitching her satchel up her shoulder. "Against whom? For what?""Snape," James replied without hesitation. "Who else?""What did he do?" she asked cautiously.James, Sirius, and Peter all stared aghast while Remus just kept his head down. "He was a total berk to Remus!" Sirius said. "Or did you somehow miss his outburst in class? Or do you just not care?"Lily's eyes flashed. "I care about Remus! However it—what he said didn't seem... I mean, he was only trying to salvage the—""Don't," Remus managed to get out, wiping his eyes off on his sleeve. Snape's words echoed through his head, along with Dedenne, along with the knowledge he probably should be locked away for everyone's safety. "Please don't defend him to me!" Peter put an arm protectively around Remus while Sirius moved to stand between Remus and Lily as if wanting to physically shield him."I think you should just move along, Evans," Sirius said, folding his arms as he stood at full height.Lily looked at Remus who turned his gaze back down. He was too distraught to be diplomatic right now. "Right. I—I'll see you at study group tonight." She quickly walked away, obviously irritated.As soon as she was gone James guided Remus into the nearest bathroom to help calm him down but the second the door shut he burst into tears, trying to apologize for being so babyish and dumb. He hated crying as a reaction! It made him feel pathetic, like the tears invalidated his anger. His friends promised him there wasn't anything wrong with crying, and Peter hugged Remus while Sirius and James got wet towels to wipe his face off. Finally he managed to calm down enough to tell them what Snape had said—including the threat of dumping boiling potion and, of course, the mentally unhinged bit, downplaying the locked away part since they would have no idea how much that hurt him.Sirius went off into a raging rant. He stormed back and forth, shrieking furiously until he punched the wall. "He's going to get it. He is going to get it!""Of course he is," Pete said, arms still around Remus."With the cloak we can can get some super revenge," James said, fetching a new bit of damp cloth for Remus. "We'll get him, Remy."Remus wiped his face one more time then they headed to Charms, Remus knowing perfectly well he looked like he had been crying. Lily gave him a wide-eyed look when he entered the classroom and a few minutes after they began their work he got a note from her asking if he was all right.I'm not okay at the moment but I will be. I just wanted to help make the potion and he would not allow me to do anything, and when I tried he shouted at me and threatened me.They talked after class, walking slowly to the Great Hall. Lily apologized, explaining that she hadn't realized how much Snape had upset him till she saw he had been crying. "If you want me to talk to him..."Remus shook his head. "No, please. That will just cause problems and—and I don't want to do that.""So instead you're just—you're going to prank him?" she asked, eyes narrowing."Yes," he replied, jutting his chin out. "I know you don't approve—""Of course I don't!" she whispered, linking her arm with his to pull him closer. "I don't approve of what he did either, if that's what you think. If the situation were reversed, I wouldn't be happy if he was trying to get revenge against you. What will you do if I tell him you're after him?"Remus frowned in thought then said, "Still go after him."/\/\/\/\/\"'Still go after him'?" James demanded later that day when they were back in their dorm after all their classes and Remus reported the conversation. "She's gonna tell him!""Good," Remus said, unloading all his stuff onto his desk."Good?" James asked.Remus sighed, stacking his books carefully. "Are you just going to echo me? Yes, it is good. It's like Spinnet. He knows we're after him. It will irritate him, get under his skin."Sirius clapped Remus on the shoulder making him jump. "Perfect," he said, sending a wicked grin to James and Peter as James put on some music, dancing wildly to the beat. "Speaking of Spinnet...""Tomorrow," Remus said, turning around with a smile. "I think we can do the thief thing tomorrow." He pulled a piece of parchment out of his desk and enchanted it so it followed a few feet above Sirius's head. He put the protection spells on it then James tried blasting it to no avail. "With all three of you adding your protection spells as well it should last a good while.""Mine won't help much," Peter said, watching the paper float around Sirius's head.James danced over to Peter and put his hands on either side of his face, squishing him a little. "Peeeter you're brilliant, okay?" He made Peter nod and said in a squeakier voice to imitate Pete, "'Yes I'm brilliant'."Peter laughed, pushing James away, blushing slightly. James took his hand, pulling him up to join in dancing. Sirius started dancing too, all of them begging Remus to dance as well which he did, reluctantly for a few awkward moments, then dove back to his desk to 'work'./\/\/\/\/\It was quite a day. Sirius had done up a fancy sign with big, bold calligraphy on both sides stating THIEF! and they all put multiple protection spells on it. After breakfast Remus attached it to Spinnet as they left the Great Hall and it wasn't until they got to Herbology that anyone said anything about it although several people stared at it on the way to the greenhouses. Struthers didn't notice since Remus figured he would have said something if he did."Mr. Spinnet what is above your head?" Sprout said as soon as they met her in front of the greenhouses.Spinnet looked up but the sign was slightly behind him so he didn't see it. The other Gryffindors and the Hufflepuffs began laughing as Spinnet jerked around until he finally saw it. "Wh—what? What does that say?""It says thief!" laughed McNab, clapping her hands.Spinnet whirled on the Marauders, face reddening. "You did this!" he snarled. All four Marauders put on innocent faces. "Stop that! Who else would it be?!""Maybe someone else heard that you have sticky fingers?" suggested James, fluttering his eyelashes.Spinnet twitched like he might go for his wand but Sprout cleared her throat. "All right, enough of that. We've got class to attend to.""Professor, take the sign down!" Spinnet cried out.Sprout looked at the sign and pointed her wand. Remus held his breath as she said in a bored tone, "Finite incantatum." But nothing happened. He exhaled quietly while Sirius softly smacking Remus's arm in excitement. "Hmm. It's not bothering anyone so let's wait till after class. Come along then, Greenhouse Three again."Remus had hoped that would be the case, as throughout his time at Hogwarts he had seen various students with magical problems without the teachers fixing them right away, as long as it wasn't hurting anyone. Horse ears, purple skin, wriggling hair... just last week Remus had seen two fourth years scrambling along the hallway with their feet a few inches off the ground as they headed to class, and in his first year he had seen an older student being forced to rhyme everything when he spoke. Hadn't McGonagall herself admitted to Remus when she was in school she gave someone a beak and it lasted several days? Since the thief thing wasn't really harming anyone, Remus had hoped the teachers wouldn't really do much about it.Spinnet was in a beyond angry mood all through class. They heard him grumbling and complaining the entire time, swearing under his breath to Struthers, shooting glares at the Marauders, etc, etc. At one point he walked past their table and 'accidentally' knocked Peter's pot off the edge of the table.After class Spinnet stayed behind, so the Marauders sort've walked very slowly to the school, hanging out as best they could to see whether Sprout removed the sign. They all burst into giggles when Spinnet emerged from the greenhouse with THIEF! still floating above him. They watched him approach Struthers who made unsure gestures. Spinnet got his wand out, shooting spells up at the parchment. Whatever he was trying clearly didn't work and he began stomping again with Struthers following."C'mon, before he sees us!" James ran off with the other three following at close heel."His face!" laughed Sirius as they burst through the doors, staggering into the castle. "Oh, he's so mad!""Maybe he shouldn't be stealing then," Peter said.The four of them dove down a side corridor then took secret passages back up to their dorms to avoid confrontation with Spinnet though Remus figured they'd see one another in the bathrooms. Sure enough when he stepped out of his shower he saw the THIEF! parchment floating above one of the shower stalls. He shook his head, quite amused. He was still amused several minutes later when almost everyone was in the dorm and Spinnet was raging against James and Sirius.Sirius pretty much repeated what Pete said earlier. "If you weren't a thief, maybe this wouldn't have happened."Spinnet ground his teeth. "You lot are absolutely insufferable!""At least we're not thieves," James said. Remus snorted, trying not to laugh due to the fact they had just stolen the mandrake plant a month ago."Okay fine, message recieved!" Spinnet jabbed his finger towards the parchment. "Get rid of this!"James and Sirius both looked up at the sign then at each other. "Not sure how to," Sirius said with a yawn."It'll wear off before the day's out," James assured him.Spinnet breathed heavily then turned on Remus who gave a slight squeak of fear, worried Spinnet might just attack him. "You!" He grabbed Remus's arm, yanking him forward roughly. "You're the brains behind everything they do, get rid of this!"Sirius leapt across the room. "Don't you touch him!" he snapped, pushing Spinnet away from Remus.Spinnet glowered past Sirius. "Get rid of this. Now!"Remus gave a helpless shrug. "It'll w—wear off.""AAARRRGH! I hate you ALL! I am going to McGonagall!" He stormed out, slamming the door hard behind him."You..." Struthers started then stopped, giving a rather resolved sigh. "I know what he did was wrong but you guys..." That's all he seemed to be able to say before he left as well, obviously disappointed in how things were going between his dormmates.The Marauders all dissolved into giggles pretty much right away, James giving everyone high fives. Remus felt slightly bad for upsetting Spinnet so much until he remembered the previous year when Spinnet tried to use the full body bind on Remus after one of his nightmares, and all sympathy dissipated immediately.

Professor McGonagall was less than amused with the Marauders' revenge against Spinnet. She called them into her office during lunch, the four of them sitting crowded together while Spinnet sat off to one side. The THIEF! sign was still floating above his head. Remus wondered if McGonagall had tried to get rid of it and failed, trying not to feel smug at that thought. Obviously she hadn't tried because McGonagall would definitely be able to destroy it.Right?"It was just a joke!" James protested after McGonagall demanded answers. "He stole from me. He—" James stopped then flopped back against his seat, folding his arms. "Well it's not hurting him, is it? Besides his pride which, I mean, he is a thief so...""Mr. Potter we cannot have students exacting revenge against one another!" McGonagall said angrily. "I've told you this countless times.""It's just a harmless prank," Sirius tried, putting on his most charming smile. "Certainly more harmless than some of the others we've done!"McGonagall just stared at Sirius then slowly pressed her fingertips against her forehead. Remus sorta wanted to do the same, amazed at how stupid Sirius could be sometimes. "Is that really the defense you're going with, Mr. Black?"Sirius gave an even more charming smile which Remus didn't think was possible. "Yes?""Professor, they're always targeting me!" Spinnet said, hands jerking in annoyance. "I try to put up with them but it's so hard!""You're not exactly easy to get along with, Mr. Sunshine!" James snapped right back. "You're rude to us. You're horrible to Remus—""What have I done to Loopy—" Spinnet stopped, going a little red at the nickname that slipped out. Even McGonagall raised an eyebrow. "Ah, L-Lupin," he quickly corrected himself. Sirius waved his hand in a 'see?!' manner. "I tried to befriend Lupin last month, you can ask him!"Now everyone was looking at Remus. "Yes," he said slowly, "and then you c-called me a st—stuck up tosser.""He what?" Sirius's head jerked back and forth, face white. "When was this? When did you call him—""Oh shut up Black! It's nothing to do with you!" Spinnet growled, shooting dark looks at Remus for telling the truth."It's everything to do with me! Remus is my friend and if you're insulting him—""I'm not insulting him!""You called him a stuck up tosser!""Yeah, a month ago!""Oh, wow, yeah, that changes everything you cracked cauldron—""Oh-ho-ho out of EVERYONE in the dorm I'm the one being called a cracked cauldron when you four are completely insane—"Sirius opened his mouth to interrupt Spinnet but McGonagall beat him to it, shouting, "BOYS!" causing them both to fall silent. "Enough arguing. Never in all my day! You are housemates, dormmates! I cannot believe the hostility before me!" She looked down her nose at them, over her glasses. "I don't expect everyone in my house to get along however to see such a display brings shame to the Gryffindor name!""Maybe if he stopped insulting Remus," Sirius muttered."Or stealing our stuff!" added James."Yeah, sure, it's all my fault because you two are innocent angels!" Spinnet laughed, throwing his hands in the air. "Professor, you know perfectly well how much trouble they cause! They drive me crazy.""I will not tolerate this," McGonagall said, carefully adjusting her glasses. "Who did this spell?" She eyed James and Sirius for half a second then stared down Remus who tried not to squirm. "Mr. Lupin, are you part of this?" Remus began trembling very slightly then hesitantly shook his head. He felt ill being asked directly by McGonagall. He didn't want to lie to her! "Mr. Lupin," she said again.He bowed his head. "I m-might have done a—a bit of research," he mumbled."Mr. Lupin, did you do this spell?"Remus gulped but then James jumped in with, "It was my idea, Professor. One hundred percent my idea."She didn't break her gaze away from Remus. "I did not ask whose idea it was, Mr. Potter; I asked if Mr. Lupin did the magic.""I did it," Sirius said, stretching his arms above his head. McGonagall stared at him now. "Just because it's a fancy bit of spellwork doesn't automatically mean the genius did it. James had the idea, Remus did the research, I did the magic, and Pete's just an innocent victim caught up in this whirlwind of accusation very similar to how he was an innocent victim when Spinnet stole his journal." Sirius tilted his head to one side. "I mean, we're not forgetting the fact our roommate has sticky fingers, are we?""Mr. Black, Mr. Spinnet has already been punished accordingly," McGonagall said, face tightening up. "If you did the spell then please remove what you have done to the parchment."Sirius glanced up at the sign. "It'll wear off soon," he said sweetly."Now, Mr. Black."He got his wand out. "Finite incantatum!" he said but nothing happened. He gave an 'oh well' smile to McGonagall. "Can't you do it, Professor?""It seems that I cannot," she replied and Remus fought not to grin. He couldn't believe it! All the fortification spells had worked!"It will wear off," Sirius said again."Is there a problem with him walking around with a sign declaring him for what he is?" James asked.McGonagall narrowed her eyes. "Five points from Gryffindor for Mr. Lupin, and ten points each from Gryffindor for Misters Potter and Black, and detention for Mr. Black.""Th—that's it?!" Spinnet asked, jaw dropping."It is more than you received for what you did, Mr. Spinnet," she said simply. "I don't agree with their getting revenge however it doesn't seem as if we can remove the sign. If the spell does not wear off by the time you go to bed I will look further into this." She glanced out the side of her eyes towards Sirius. "Impressive work, Mr. Black, I do say.""Oh, er, yeah! Yeah, thanks," Sirius said, tossing his hair back, trying to look all suave."This is ridiculous." Spinnet stood up, fingers curling into fists. "They always get away with everything. I got detention for what I did!""Yes, and I was only going to take fifteen points away for what you did however you insisted on the detention," McGonagall reminded him. "And I have given Mr. Black detention as well.""Pratty and Loopy should get detention too!" Spinnet said, pointing at Remus. "He's the one who did the spell, I know he did! Black's not smart enough! Or talented enough!""Oi!" Sirius huffed."They get away with everything!" Spinnet continued, ignoring Sirius."They haven't gotten away with this," McGonagall replied. "Now, I am sorry you don't deem their punishment fair but I feel like it is adequate. You may return to lunch."Spinnet opened and closed his mouth a few times then got up, storming past the Marauders, slamming the door shut behind him. The Marauders all got up as well, James and Sirius clearly trying not to snicker as they shuffled out. As soon as the door shut James punched the air, letting out a quiet laugh."Remy, will the spell wear off?" he asked, eyes sparkling."I'll remove the spells as the day goes on, to make it appear so," Remus said. "They may on their own. Actually, they probably will however I have no guarantee that they would wear off before the day's end by themselves so... I just need to make sure that happens. Sirius, how come you accepted the blame for the spells?"Sirius shrugged, stuffing his hands in his pockets. "Iunno. Seemed like a good idea. Keep you out of trouble.""It was a good idea," James said, squeezing Remus's shoulder. "Everyone knows you're the brains but we don't wanna advertise too much how true that is!""You okay with me taking the glory?" Sirius asked, eyes widening a bit.Remus shook his head. "N—no, I appreciate it. I'd prefer to avoid detention."James and Sirius just gave him rather blank looks, obviously not seeing the benefits of doing so!/\/\/\/\/\As the day progressed Remus slowly removed the protection spells on the THIEF! sign. By supper it was sagging low, a mere six or seven inches above Spinnet's head. Remus knew if anyone tried to blast it the parchment would probably only take a couple hits before exploding. Just when supper ended Remus removed what he thought was the second to last spell then hurried off to Occlumency. He rather hoped Fawley wouldn't see the (possibly petty?) revenge on Spinnet but of course it was one of the first things she saw. He could see the disapproval on her face when they emerged from his head."It w-was harmless," he said immediately, to defend it. "He did steal from Peter! I m—mean he meant to steal from James, but either way he is a thief.""I understand," she said gently. "It's not so much the revenge... it..." She trailed off and Remus waited for her to give him whatever lecture she wanted to give him. "It just worries me about how closely woven you and your friends are getting.""Oh." He made a face, not wanting to discuss this!"Don't make that face," she chided.Remus blinked. "Um, how... uh—""I could tell by the way you said 'oh'." Fawley smiled, shaking her head. "You know I am not entirely opposed to them being your friends. It just worries me that you are so tightly knit. You intended to distance yourself from them this year, didn't you?"Remus tugged at the hem of his vest. "Um. I mean, yeah, I—I did. But... they don't... they're just..."Fawley tilted her head. "You're trying to find an excuse as to why you should remain so close to them."He let out a sigh. "I... guess I d-don't really have one. Only that I..." He stopped, unsure whether to continue, to express his feelings. Fawley remained silent. "I care about them. They care about me. They don't... seem to mind my... oddities. The weird things that I do. Like when I need to go under the bed, they don't—don't make fun of me for that." He thought back to the monologue he had given Rocky the previous month, how much his heart had ached that day. How miserable he had been at the thought of having to break things off. Fawley had glimpsed that afternoon but only him playing with Rocky, she hadn't seen—or rather, hadn't heard everything he had said."Remus—""I will," he blurted out. "I will, when—""When they start to suspect," she said, angrily pushing her fingers through her hair. "You do understand that that will be too late, right?"Remus felt partially angry, partially sad. He knew she was right. Knew she was right... he just didn't want to admit it. He felt like he could fend off any potential disaster, cutting them out before it was too late. "Do you know anything about thestrals?""You're changing the subject," she said.Remus shrugged. "I am. Do you know anything about thestrals?"She didn't say anything for several long seconds then she sat back, sighing heavily. "Yes. They are winged horses who are invisible to most.""You know... how people c-can see them?" he asked.Fawley slowly nodded. "Yes. Can you see them?""Yes," he said. "I—I saw them last Christmas holidays. I'm surprised you n... never saw my reaction..." He bit his bottom lip, realizing what had happened over the holidays had probably overridden anything else. Fawley had witnessed a memory of Lyall slapping Remus, and it hadn't gone well. "I sh—should have asked you sooner. I've spent the past near year feeling awful for being able to see them all this time.""I'm very sorry, Remus," she said softly. "I had no idea you could see them.""Do you s—" He stopped quickly, blushing. "Did you see them before?"Fawley just smiled. "No, I was never able to before I was blinded.""Can you see them in my memories?" he asked, very curious now."As far as I know, no," she said slowly. "However I don't recall seeing a memory of them from you so shall we test this?"He thought back to seeing them in the pen in the forest and was soon pulled into the memory. It lasted only a moment or two then they exited from his thoughts. He waited, excited for the answer."Yes," she said. "I could see them.""Fascinating," he murmured, rubbing his chin. "If you see someone's memory of them you can see them even if you yourself cannot. That opens up the doors to a—a lot of possibilities over who can see them and—""I was there when Elara Black was killed. From what I can understand about them, even if you aren't directly looking at the person at the moment of their death, your... presence, being a 'witness' seems to count. I did not see Black's last moment however I clearly heard—" She quickly stopped, face paling."So would you be able to see them in the memory of someone who cannot?" he asked, wondering what would happen if she went into Sirius or Peter's memory of that moment."I don't know. Perhaps it's something we can look into at a later point. Now, let's return to Occlumency—""Wait!" He pulled back from her hands. "I brought up the thestrals for a specific reason and wasn't... well, the thing is Professor Prewett says the only way to see them—and books, books have said it too once I knew what to look up—that the only way to see them are to have witnessed death, as you said, and accept it." He began toying with the frayed edge of his sleeve. "The thing is I don't know... where I've witnessed death. James saw his grandfather and Pierce said she saw her cousin, but I haven't seen anyone die. Unless it was when I was a baby. Would... that count?"Fawley frowned, brow furrowing. "I don't know what to tell you. It... is the only way to see thestrals... so I don't understand how you could see them if you haven't witnessed death.""I was wondering if it's because I'm—I'm an animal," he confessed. Her lips puckered as if she had eaten something very sour. "I'm not human," he added, shifting around."No," she reluctantly agreed. "I suppose not fully. But I'm unsure...""If I think about death and you go into my head and I have seen someone die, would that memory pop up?" he asked.Her smile was very wane. "It doesn't quite work that way but if you wish to try, feel free."He spent the rest of their time together focusing on death and while they went through several miserable, depressing memories that made them both sad, none of them involved death itself so he left feeling a little let down and more confused than ever./\/\/\/\/\Spinnet's sign was gone by bed time so the next day the Marauders were free to work on their plan of getting revenge against Snape. Since Wednesday mornings were pretty open they spent the entire stretch of time before Charms to try to figure out the best thing to do. They shot ideas down almost as soon as they were suggested, only a few gaining the interest of all four of them. Peter wrote down all the ideas they agreed on until they had a list of five."I still say poison is a good option," Sirius grumbled when Remus refused to let Peter write that down."What do we have so far?" James asked.Peter sat upright, clearing his throat. "Hair removal potion in his shampoo—""Won't work, he never uses shampoo," Sirius grumbled, kicking at the floor.Peter rolled his eyes and continued. "Sticky spell his bed and dump buckets of hefklork eggs on it—""No, I am against that since he would know a hundred percent it was us and that we have access to his dorm," Remus said, looking up. "I thought we decided not to.""Aw, it'd drive him nuts knowing we can get in there and him unable to prove it!" James laughed.Remus shot him a bit of a glare. "His satchel, we were going to do that to his satchel."James groaned but nodded at Peter who scratched out 'bed' and wrote 'satchel'. "There. 'Kay, fountain of green slime from his head—""Like anyone would notice a difference?" James asked, and Sirius laughed."Putting the tripping jinx on his shoes," Peter continued then waited for someone to say something. When nobody did he finished with, "Somehow getting the scent of amphyr petals onto his clothes to make him laugh endlessly."They argued a bit over which was the best one until ultimately deciding to do the tripping jinx, and the hefklork eggs. They put their plan into action the next day, at least the first part; they'd be waiting until Potions on Friday to do the egg one. So Thursday morning after Herbology they all took very speedy showers then hurried down towards the dungeons. Remus and James went under the cloak to sneak into the Slytherin common room while Sirius and Peter hung out to distract Snape (or his dormmates) if need be. James hissed the password to the wall then they hurried in. The common room was fairly empty, only a few older students scattered about studying or hanging out. James and Remus hurried up the boys' staircase, knocking on the door they knew was Snape's and, after getting no response, they slid inside. They didn't need to worry about a guard right outside the door since they could remain under the cloak for the most part."Ughhhh," James moaned when they approached the trunk whose initials were S.S. "It's Snape-y."There were two sets of shoes tucked neatly under his bed, and a pair of slippers. All three were pretty old and worn out. One pair looked a little nicer than the other, while the more worn out pair Remus thought Snape wore more often. James held up part of the cloak so Remus could put the tripping jinx on the old loafers."Want to try them on to see if it works?" Remus asked with a mischievous grin, already knowing the answer."My little friend you couldn't pay me enough to ever put my feet into Snape's gross shoes," James said, gagging loudly. Remus laughed quietly, putting his wand away. James dropped the cloak and they left the Slytherin dungeon, meeting back up with their friends to celebrate their prank, hoping Snape would be wearing those shoes the next day./\/\/\/\/\Remus stayed in the dorm when his friends went to watch James's Quidditch practice since he wanted to work on Sirius's present. Hope had sent him his needles and yarn the other day, as he requested, so he was able to start. He had some really nice scarlet yarn that he was going to do the main beanie in then he was going to try to embroider a lion's paw on it. He wasn't sure how it would turn out but it seemed a bit nicer than just a plain hat. He got a good bit done then had to rip out several rows and redo them, so he had a good bit of work left to do by the time he had to hide it in his trunk when his friends returned.Remus, who had been reading for about five minutes, glanced up as James stomped in first, face pinched. Sirius and Peter followed, not looking very pleased either. James was in the middle of complaining when he entered the room. "—tude is driving me absolutely batty! He has no right to speak to me that way, no right! It's not fair!""You should talk to Bell," Peter said, shutting the door behind them.James set his carrying case on the floor, sliding his broom under his bed, then just knelt there with a frown. "I don't know. I don't want to cause trouble." Remus tried not to snort since causing trouble was normally his number one objective! "Maybe he'll shut up after my first game.""Nah, it's just gonna make him worse, seeing how much better you are!" said Sirius."What's going on?" Remus finally asked, setting his book down."Kirke!" James snapped, getting to his feet. "The reserve Chaser? The one who got all angry over the fact I was put on the team and he wasn't?""The one who said second years shouldn't be able to join?" Remus asked, remembering the morning of the team posting.James nodded. "He's been saying some snarky stuff to me occasionally but tonight he really just..." James let out a groan then shook his head. "He was really rude. Told me the only reason I got on the team was because I have a fancy broom, and Bell's hoping my dad is gonna buy everyone brooms.""Wasn't he going to?" Remus asked.James stared incredulously. "Well, yeah, but not till next year! We're waiting so everyone can see I deserve to be on the team! It's got nothing to do with brooms or—or anything."Remus flinched slightly, realizing how tactless his comment had been. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. If your father intended to 'buy' your way onto the team he would have already donated brooms.""Exactly!" Sirius agreed. "That's what I told him. Kirke, I mean. I said, 'yeah Mr. Potter really went all out buying the team new brooms that look identical to their old brooms'!" He laughed at his own joke as he flopped across Remus's legs."Kirke's just full of it," Pete grumbled. "Telling you, you should talk to Bell. I don't think you'd get into trouble.""I don't think I would," James said, messing his hair up angrily. "But Kirke might then he might cause more trouble.""So?" Sirius asked, absentmindedly picking Remus's book up, flipping through the pages. "Let him.""I don't want to do anything that could ruin or harm the team," sighed James. He finally stopped pacing and sat down on the edge of Sirius's bed facing the other two boys, Peter quickly sitting down next to him. "I can deal with his stupid attitude. I mean, I know I was complaining but I can deal with it.""Revenge?" Sirius asked brightly, perking up.James bit his bottom lip then slowly shook his head. "No," he said and Remus knew if he had been taking a drink at that moment he'd have spit it out. "As I said, nothing to risk the team." Sirius looked a little put out but Remus felt super proud of James, and said so. James gave him a smile. "Oh trust me, it's very tempting to go do something to him. I want to. But I've got to put the team first. That means not blasting that stupid look off his stupid face." James fell backwards, staring up at his canopy. "Or doing something to that stupid gossiping tongue of his.""We could try that tongue spell Snivellus uses?" Sirius suggested.James pulled a face. "Please, please, please stop tempting me!" He covered his face with his hands and began rolling back and forth. "Remy tell me again I'm doing the right thing by doing nothing?""You are," Remus promised then yanked his legs away as Sirius tried to poke him. "Attempting revenge against a member of your Quidditch team—reserve or not—would only end poorly."James sat up so he could nod grimly in agreement while Peter just shook his head, muttering that James should talk to Bell, and Sirius turned to Remus so he could say, "Spoilsport!" Remus stuck his tongue out in response then yelped as Sirius seized a pillow and slammed it into him, which triggered a massive pillow fight that surprisingly Peter won (though Remus suspected Sirius might have if Sirius hadn't only been targeting Remus for whatever reason) and the losers gave Peter a little bit of sweets as a reward.

Author's note: One of my amazing readers has started doing a podfic of Shifting Lines! So far only the prologue is out but if you want to check it out link is in my profile!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Friday morning all four Marauders tried not to bust up into laughter when Snape stumbled into the potions classroom wearing his special loafers. Obviously he hadn't been tripping enough (yet) to make him suspect anything though Remus figured it would come out eventually. He did have a frown on his face though, and James gave Remus a low five under their desk. One prank down, one to go.Sirius had a jar full of hefklork eggs that he had added the sticking spell to ready to be dumped into Snape's satchel. They just needed a window of opportunity. Unfortunately where Snape was sitting it'd be difficult to really make a good excuse of distracting him... he was just a couple desks over, not behind them so they couldn't just go to the back, pretending to get water.Remus leaned in to his friends. "I have an idea, it will have to wait until after Slughorn dismisses class though," he whispered."Will it work?" James inquired.Remus shrugged. "I hope so."They all waited impatiently through class, Remus even more disastrous than usual since he was so edgy. He felt sick at how he would be distracting Snape but... it would be worth it. Finally after what felt like an eternity Slughorn checked over the ingredients, gave out grades, then dismissed class.Remus bounced to his feet and made his way over to Snape. "A-hem." Snape's gaze flickered up then back down as he swept everything into his satchel. Remus cleared his throat again then when Snape continued to ignore him he said, "Sn-Snape.""What?" he snarled out, standing up. His satchel was still on the bench next to him.Remus took in a deep breath. "I w—wanted t-to—to—um, to—"Snape raised his eyebrows. "Wanted to what? Stutter on incoherently like you usually do?""N-no. To, um, ap—pologize," he finally got out, seeing Sirius casually coming over out the corner of his eyes."Apologize?!" Snape looked completely taken aback. It was almost worth it just to see that look on his face."For, um, what h—happened on M—Monday. With messing up th-the potion," he forced out. He felt beyond nauseated by doing this, even if it was for a good reason. He saw Sirius's arm twitch as he walked by then Sirius kept going, tucking the empty jar into his robes pocket. "I sh-shouldn't have done it.""No," Snape growled, grabbing his satchel's strap, pulling it up over his shoulder. "You shouldn't have. You shouldn't be allowed in this classroom."Remus bit back a mean response and just walked off quickly, shame wriggling around inside of him for apologizing over something he shouldn't apologize for... though he knew once Snape discovered the eggs stuck in his satchel it'd be pretty obvious the apology wasn't a real one. Or, he hoped Snape would figure that out. He did not want Snape going around thinking Remus had been all crawly about the incident!Remus hesitated, tempted to turn around and take his words back but he spotted the other Marauders waiting for him so he hurried over. "I think I might vomit," he said, clutching his stomach."I thought I'd vomit just listening to you!" James said.Peter pressed his hands together. "Remus, I want to say that was the most amazing bit of acting I've ever seen in my entire life."Remus smiled. "Thank you, that makes me feel a little less disgusted.""Come on," Sirius said, tugging at James's sleeve. "Let's get away from here before he sticks his grimy hand into his bag!"/\/\/\/\/\Of course Remus heard all about it after study group that night. Lily showed up a couple minutes late, shooting dirty looks at Remus as she took her seat, and then proceeded to mostly ignore him. Once they were done and left the library she seized his wrist, hissing out that she needed to talk to him. He sighed, waiting for the lecture."You stuck hefklork eggs in his bag!" she said as soon as Twycross was gone."I told you we were going to get revenge," he replied, glad she hadn't brought up the tripping thing. At least is seemed like they had gotten away with that! He wondered how many times Snape had stumbled or tripped today."Is that why you 'apologized' to him?" she demanded."Yes," he said honestly. "I was the distraction. I don't expect he took the apology seriously in any case.""No," she admitted. "He was laughing about it." Remus just gave her a 'see?' look. "I still don't understand why you put a sticking spell on them! Wasn't it enough to pour them into his bag? It's going to take him ages to get it cleaned out!""Are we going to help Macdonald tonight?" he asked, not feeling like defending their actions any further. Lily just glared at him. "Or are you too mad at me?""I am mad. But Mary says there's a test in History coming up and she was hoping you could help her since you're better at that than I am... unless, of course, you want to go celebrate with your friends for the torture of Severus.""We already celebrated," he replied a little too tartly."Well then!"They walked in silence for most the rest of the way back to the tower, a couple feet apart from one another, then Lily sighed. "I just wish it wasn't like this," she said quietly. "I mean, all the—the fighting, and pranking, and bullying. With Severus.""I wish it wasn't either," he told her, genuinely meaning it—well, mostly meaning it. He turned to face her. "If he was willing to call a truce, I would accept that." He wouldn't like it, per say, but he'd accept it. If Snape wanted to stop being nasty to one another he'd agree to it."But not the others," she pointed out.Remus couldn't even pretend that James and Sirius would go with a truce! "No, they wouldn't," he agreed. "In any case, it's pointless to even think about it since he hates me." Lily pressed her lips thin, since she definitely couldn't argue that.They apologized to one another then headed into the common room to help Macdonald out with her homework./\/\/\/\/\Remus woke up from nightmares a few times that night, managing not to make too much noise which was good since he was too tired to deal with Sirius. When morning came he just stayed in bed; since it was a Saturday he didn't need to get up right away. He mumbled when James tried to get him out of bed then rolled over, pulling his blanket up over his head. It was the full moon again that night and it was already dragging him down. He drifted back into sleep until he was jerked awake by laughter. At first he thought it had only been a moment or two but when he sat up intending to grouch at his friends he saw that it was nearly eleven, and he had been asleep for at least two more hours!Sirius gladly told him that Snape was still wearing the tripping shoes, all of them laughing at his stupidity, wondering when he'd figure it out. Remus laughed a bit then went for a shower, mostly for the quiet. He curled up on the floor, the warm water nearly lulling him back to sleep despite being on stone. He supposed it was because he had slept naked on a stone floor before, back at his house when the full moons were covered sufficiently enough to prevent his transformation."Remus?"He jerked, banging his head against the wall. Hissing in pain, he sat up, rubbing the spot. "Y—yeah?""You've been in there an hour!" Sirius said.Remus scrambled to his feet, looking at his pruned fingers. Oops, he had fallen asleep! "Yeah, been thinking. I'll be out in a bit."He quickly got cleaned off, dried off as fast as he could, threw clothes on, glimpsed at his horrid appearance then hurried in to the dorm. His stomach was grumbling very loudly, as it was a bit past noon and he hadn't eaten yet. Once in the Great Hall James, Sirius, and Peter all watched as Remus piled a lot of food on his plate."I haven't eaten yet today!" he said a bit defensively."Not that," Sirius said, propping his elbow on the table, chin in hand. "You look pretty awful again.""Oh." Remus prodded at some chicken, debating on which excuse to use. He didn't look quite as bad as he had the previous month so perhaps he could get away with his mother? "I'm mostly feeling tired.""Just tired?" James asked, looking him up and down.Remus took in a slow, deep breath. "At the moment, yes. Are you going to harangue me about my health again?""Is herring like bother?" James asked."Harangue, and yes in a way.""Then no. Just voicing my concern, that's all. I won't... er, bother you." James glanced at Sirius then at Peter.Remus bowed his head, stuffing food into his face to avoid dealing with whatever was going on. "If it helps, I'll go see Pomfrey later," he said, trying his best to sound casual.Peter choked on his drink."Nah, you don't need to go see Pomfrey," Sirius said cheerfully, smacking Peter's back."Pete, you okay?" Remus asked."Uhh, yeah!" he replied, coughing a bit more into his napkin. "Went down the wrong pipe.""I was thinking we should do something really fun tonight," James said, folding his arms on the table and leaning in like it was a big conspiracy. "Stay up late, party a little...""How is that different from any other weekend night?" Remus asked, glancing up through his fringe.James rolled his eyes. "What do you want to do tonight then, Brains?""I—I'm up for the usual," he said. "I would like to finish the History assignment I have but other than that..."Before anyone else could say anything Snape suddenly appeared behind Sirius and Peter, brandishing his loafers, accusing them vehemently of cursing them. Sirius pinched his nose shut, waving his hand in front of his face. "Bloody hell, Snivellus, keep your stinky shoes away from the table!"Several other students were watching them with interest, figuring there would be a big explosion sooner or later. Snape's cheeks were slightly pink as he lowered his arm. "One of you cursed my shoes," he repeated in a slow, furious manner."They look like normal shoes," James remarked.Lily came down towards them, arms tight across her chest. "What's going on?" she asked. Snape looked at her then back towards the Slytherin table so briefly Remus doubted many people noticed. He probably didn't want her coming to his rescue so publicly."Ask your friend," James grumbled. "He's pushing his shoes into our faces while we're trying to eat. It's disgusting.""Just forget it!" Snape said, whirling around to storm out of the Great Hall. Lily glared at James then followed Snape out the doors.She returned shortly after, barreling towards the Marauders. Now she accused them of cursing Snape's shoes while James and Sirius protested their innocence. Lily clearly didn't believe them so she went to the High Table to get McGonagall. McGonagall followed Lily back down and James and Sirius promised they hadn't done anything, insisting Snape was just being paranoid."If we had done the tripping jinx on his shoes, it would have just tripped him!" James pointed out."You can put it on his shoes when he isn't wearing them, moron!" Lily snapped then blushed slightly at the eyebrow raise McGonagall gave her."So what you're saying is Snape took off his shoes around us and we jinxed them when he wasn't looking?" Sirius asked, scratching his head.Lily opened her mouth then clamped it shut. When he put it like that, it really made the argument seem futile."I'll speak with Mr. Snape and Professor Slughorn," McGonagall said in a sort of tone that made Remus suspect she wasn't going to blame the Marauders thanks to Sirius's brilliance. She swept back to the teachers' table while Lily stalked back to her friends."I mean, neither of you did it anyway," Peter snorted, covering his mouth as he began laughing.After lunch they went outside to enjoy the sun. Sirius wanted to play tag but Remus was so exhausted he just sat on a hill watching them run around. It was still nearly five hours until sunset but it seemed as though everything was already pressing down on him, making his limbs move as though in slow motion. He hugged his knees to his chest, resting his chin on his knees, yawning several times until his friends decided they were done running. They plopped down in the grass around him, chattering very animatedly about various things.Eventually Sirius poked Remus with a small stick, asking him again about Pomfrey. "You look awful," he said.Remus rubbed his eyes, figuring he might as well get it over with. "I'm starting to feel awful," he told them. James and Peter stared at him (Peter with a strange look on his face) while Sirius nodded, getting to his feet. He wiped his jeans off then offered a hand to help Remus up. Remus took it, surprised at how warm and sweaty Sirius's hand felt even though he had been resting for a good twenty minutes. It wasn't that hot out."We'll go with you," James said."You don't need to.""We don't mind!" Sirius promised.Peter still had a strange expression and remained quiet the entire time to the hospital wing. Just before they got there Remus turned to face him. "Are you doing all right?"Peter jumped a little then gulped, nodding. "Yeah, my stomach just hurts some. I think from running around after lunch."Remus reached for the door then stopped. "Shoot, I don't have my bag with me...""Bag?" Sirius asked."Yeah, in case I do have to stay. I don't have any books with me. Let's go back to the dorm."They stuck with him all the way up to the tower where he put books into his bag, feeling stupid for not having packed earlier because he needed to put clothes in there... but they were all hanging around. There was no way to put clothes in without them noticing so he figured he'd just ask Pomfrey for some hospital pajamas, that would probably work. Next time he'd know to pre-pack, in case of a situation like this.They still stuck with him back down to the hospital wing, irritating him a little bit. He wasn't sure why they were all so... glue-y today. At least he wasn't having issues that caused their presence to make him feel uncomfortable. Just annoyed.Once in the hospital wing there was quite an argument between Pomfrey and the other Marauders, as they wanted to stay. She finally managed to get them out by threatening to summon McGonagall. "If you insist on waiting, wait outside; this is private!" she snapped.They trudged out while Remus hopped up onto a hospital bed, mumbling apologies for them but Pomfrey just shook her head, not particularly caring. She gave pajamas for Remus to change into and let him go back to the room he stayed in during the days of his first year's full moon. She let the other Marauders come in so Remus could tell them he was having another relapse. He was propped up in bed, trying his best to appear as frustrated as possible."I don't think I am," he huffed. Sirius stood at the foot of his bed with a strangely smirky expression, while James and Peter seemed a little fidgety. "I'm sure after an hour or so it'll pass and I'll be able to leave.""Hopefully!" James said, clapping his hands once. "We need to party tonight.""But don't push yourself," Peter put in.Remus smiled. "I won't, I promise. But I'm sure it's nothing."After they left Remus took a short nap then got dressed again in his regular clothes. Pomfrey gave him two sets of hospital PJs to take with him then wrapped him up in a cloak, taking him out to the Whomping Willow. She took him all the way through the tunnel again, going over the rules once more—making sure to write twice a day on the chalkboard, etc, etc. Remus nodded, making quiet agreement noises, then went through the trapdoor. Pomfrey stayed in the tunnel this time, waving goodbye until the door was shut. He heard her hurried footsteps leaving.Remus yawned, trudging to the bedroom to tuck everything into the wardrobe. He took off his clothes, debating on wearing the pajamas then just went to bed naked in case he slept clear till sunset, curling up in a nest of shredded, wolf-smelling blankets./\/\/\/\/\In the morning Remus's body twisted back into the form of a small human boy and he lay in the middle of a puddle of blood, panting heavily. His entire right arm felt both numb and on fire at the same time; he wasn't sure how that worked. He sat up, propping himself on his left arm. He let out a moan of pain when he saw his right arm had been pretty much clawed to shreds. He couldn't even move it. Bits of flesh and muscle were on the floor nearby and he jerked to his left side so he could vomit. Pain wrenched through his body as he did so.His legs were a bit torn up but not too bad and he was able to get to his feet, swaying. He stumbled then sank back down onto the floor, passing out from pain. He wasn't sure how long he was out but when he woke up again he pushed himself to get to the bathroom, to tell Pomfrey he was fine. He left a trail of blood and when he picked up the chalk he nearly collapsed again. He only got one shaky line done before sliding down to the floor in tears.Pomfrey showed up not long after. He had managed to nab a towel to cover his privates before she burst into the bathroom. "Oh, Remus," she said in a gentle tone. She knelt down, immediately bandaging up his right arm. "You weren't trying to tell me you were fine, were you?" she asked as she worked."N-no," he lied. "Was t—trying to call for—for help," he got out, more tears squeezing out from the jolts of pain being caused from her movements."Mmhmm." He knew she didn't believe him. "You'll be returning to the school for the day."He was too out of it to argue, just let her do her work. She helped him into pajamas then they headed down into the tunnel, Remus's right arm bandaged tight against his chest. Once in the hospital wing he collapsed into bed, falling asleep before he could get any food in him. He woke up at around ten when Pomfrey came in with a chocolate shake. She enchanted it to float next to him so he remained laying down as he slurped it down through the straw, trying not to cry at how pathetic he felt./\/\/\/\/\His arm was still pretty messed up when he went back to the house and he hoped it wouldn't be too bad when morning came...When he came to after transforming back into a human in the morning he saw his arm wasn't much worse, but definitely wasn't better. His wolf had ripped into the arm again and it dangled uselessly down his side. This time, though, he did force himself to write to Pomfrey to insist he was fine. arm mostly better not bad. He faded in and out of consciousness as he took a shower then wrapped his arm up, hoping he did an all right job. After that he got pajama pants on, not bothering with a shirt. He was a little chilly but it wasn't unbearable.He slept for most the morning then ate raw food from the fridge, too in pain and too tired to cook anything. After another nap he scrubbed the floors as clean as he could get them, gagging as he had to throw away dried up bits of his own torn body. Gonna have to do some research into proper cleaning spells, make this maybe not as difficult as it is... Except, he couldn't have his wand with him. If the wolf got to it and destroyed it, his family couldn't afford to replace it. I guess it'll just have to continue being the Muggle way of cleaning, he thought miserably as he collapsed on the sofa./\/\/\/\/\That night was awful. When he woke up just before sunset he could hear rain pattering on the roof so he spent several hours in the living room, naked except for the tattered remains of a sheet around him. Eventually the rain stopped and the clouds must have parted as he transformed around midnight, then back to human at about one. He could hear the fierce winds outside and suspected he was in for a horrible night and sure enough at around two in the morning the wind pushed the heavy clouds aside enough for him to twist back into a wolf... then return to being human half an hour later, then a wolf, and then human again. The rapid succession of transformations really did him in. Not so much in a painful manner but in an absolutely exhausted manner. The energy burnt from having hardly any time between the transformations made him even more weary than usual.Finally dawn came (along with more rain) and he dragged himself to the bathroom. am fine it was too cloudy most the night he wrote then got into the shower to clean off. Once he was dried off and in the bedroom upstairs to put pajamas on he felt terrified when he heard distant footsteps then the trapdoor opening. His heart leapt into his throat and he timidly crept to the door."Remus?" Pomfrey called out.For a second he was relieved it was just Pomfrey, then confused as to why she was there. He frowned, going to the top of the stairs. "I'm doing well," he said. "I s-said so on the board. Are you just visiting?"Pomfrey gave him a strange look. "Last night was the final phase," she said.Remus blinked then felt incredibly stupid. It had already been three nights! "I—I had a strange night, I suppose that's why I forgot," he mumbled. "Let me get my things."He got changed into the clothes he had been wearing on Saturday, dumped everything into his bag, then went downstairs. Even though he wasn't very injured, he was absolutely exhausted and weak, and felt ready to collapse. Pomfrey had to help him to the school, and the second he hit the hospital bed he was asleep./\/\/\/\/\His entire body still felt weak when he woke up. When he managed to get to the bathroom he gasped at the sight of his face. He had clearly lost some weight over the past couple days. Pomfrey used a weighing spell, confirming that he had lost seven pounds which—being so tiny—he couldn't afford even a sixth of that."You're staying in here for the rest of the day," she ordered, forcing him back into bed."I have Occl—""No," she said, tucking him into bed. "I'll allow you to leave after supper however you're not doing anything that requires effort. I'll inform Albus. Did you even eat over the weekend other than what you had here on Sunday? After all, you also had quite a bit of blood loss!"Remus nodded. "I did!" he promised, although he hadn't eaten much. He had been in too much pain to attempt to eat much.She gave him a couple shakes in the morning then brought a fairly hearty lunch. He slept and ate throughout the afternoon, feeling quite a lot of better when he woke up at around three. She remarked that he looked a lot better too, but didn't want him going to Occlumency; besides, Dumbledore had already informed Fawley he wasn't in any shape for it... but as long as he promised to rest, he could leave the wing. He noticed she waited until his final class of the day was over, however was glad he didn't have to stay.Fifteen minutes later he was crawling into his bed in his dorm, fully dressed still, not caring. He slept pretty soundly until voices tore him back into wakefulness. The other Marauders bounded into the room, filling the very air with their energy. Remus wished he could have their energy. Even when he wasn't bone-tired from the full moon he could see a difference between them..."—ish I didn't have practice tonight," James was saying as they came in."We can talk tomorrow morning," Sirius said rather gravely."What time d'you think he'll be back?" Pete asked.That caught Remus's attention. He sat up in bed, staring at the curtains.Sirius let out a sigh. "Evening, probably, after whatever it is he does on Tuesdays."They don't know I'm here. Remus bit his lip, debating whether or not to announce his presence. He was aching to know what they were talking about! Besides him, obviously."We could talk tonight, after practice," said Peter."But Spinnet and Struthers would probably be barging in," James pointed out. "By the time I'm back, that's close to when they come to the dorm usually.""We could ask them not to come in?" Peter then suggested."I think we should see how things go when he comes back," Sirius said, sounding nervous. "Really, we should probably wait a day or two.""Why?" Peter asked."He's—we should let him... recover."Remus grew sick to his stomach. He couldn't bear to let them continue even though he knew they'd just pretend it was something else once they realized he was there. He quietly lay back down then yawned loudly, rolling over in bed, making sure to mess with his blanket to make noise. He wasn't sure if they could hear him though, with the spells."What do you think he's going to say?" James asked, suddenly sounding as nervous as Sirius.Apparently they couldn't hear. The yawn wasn't loud enough. Remus shifted around then sat up, pulling the curtains back while he yawned again. All three of his friends shrieked, Peter jumping back."Oh, hey guys," Remus said as sleepily as he could sound. He rubbed one eye as if he had just woken up."You're—back!" Sirius said, voice rather strangled.Remus looked at all their pale faces. "Did something happen?" he asked."Blimey, are you okay?!" Pete gasped."Remus, you look really..." Sirius trailed off, looking Remus up and down."I'm okay," he promised, swinging his legs out of bed. "I lost some weight, that's all.""You were already too tiny," James said.Remus wasn't sure whether or not to respond to that so instead he said, "You guys seem quite on edge about something.""No!" Pete squeaked at the same time James said, "Not at all!" and Sirius said, "It's nothing."Remus raised his eyebrows. "Um. Okay."He could smell how anxious they were with an underlying tone of fear. Peter was the most visibly freaked out, wringing his hands and shooting quick glances at the other two. James kept shifting his weight from foot to foot, an awkward expression on his face. Sirius was the most collected, arms folded as he studied Remus."Something is going on," Remus said, standing up. "Something that I think involves me. Am I right?" he pushed when they remained silent. "Is there something you want to say to me?"Sirius let out a slow breath. "All right, hold on." He got a piece of paper out from his desk, quickly scribbling on it. He went to the door, opening it up and sticking it on the outside of the door. Emergency Marauder Meeting! Dorm Will Be Open Again Soon. He shut the door and used a locking spell. While he did this James and Peter began pulling the curtains off their beds. Remus just watched all of this with a feeling of dread. When Sirius shut the door, James and Pete stuck their curtains up over the door."To muffle it," James explained, noticing Remus's furrowed brow."Wh—why would you n-n-need to m—muffle it?" Remus stammered, taking a few steps back. The hairs on the back of his neck were standing on end and the wolf inside of him was stirring from all the panic sweeping through his body. He had no idea what was going on but he didn't like it one bit. It didn't help that he still felt weak.Now all three of them were looking at him again. He took another step back, nearly throwing up as a stab of fear went into his head. Do they know? he wondered wildly, trying to tamp down those thoughts because he doubted they'd be so... well, they weren't exactly calm but they weren't at all acting as though they were now locked in a room with a beast. He swallowed, repeating that thought over and over to try to keep himself as placated as possible."Remus..." Sirius took a step closer."W-w-wh—wh-what?" he somehow managed to ask.Then his heart broke as he realized what this was about. They didn't want to be friends anymore. That's what it had to be. Something triggered them to realize how much of a freak he was and they were figuring out the best way to break it to him gently.He began breathing heavily, palms getting a little sweaty. Okay. He could deal with this. It would be devastating—crushing, crippling, wholly and utterly shattering—but no where near as bad as if they had figured out—"We know you're a werewolf."

Remus couldn't move.He couldn't breathe.Couldn't anything.Then it slammed into him, and he nearly vomited.He was certain he misheard—had to have misheard—because they couldn't know, they couldn't know!It was impossible!Because if they knew then that meant they only just now figured out, because they had been acting fine up until now, and if they only just figured out they wouldn't be around him and—and—"Remus?" Sirius asked.He had no idea how long he had been standing there in terrified silence but Sirius's voice broke him out of it. He wanted to just bolt. Out of the room, out of the castle. Just run all the way home to Wales where his family could quickly pack everything up and leave.He thought he might just pass out.But all he did was laugh.It was a crazed sort of laugh, and it confused the other boys."He's... laughing?" Peter asked.Remus took a few steps back, laughing that screwed up insane-not-amused laughter so hard he couldn't breathe. He wasn't sure why he was laughing, it was just an automatic response. He kept laughing until the tears started coming out and then he felt like he might just cry."Remus?" Sirius asked again, looking concerned.He had to just play it cool, make it seem otherwise. Perhaps they didn't know-know, just guess. He could get out of this. Long enough to escape, at least. As long as the wolf inside of him didn't burst out like it wanted to."What?" he finally wheezed out, wiping his face off. "What in Merlin's name are you talking about?" His voice was squeaky, and it took a lot of effort not to scream.Now they all looked unsure. Sirius dropped his arms, forehead scrunching. "Ooookay, I, uh, definitely hadn't planned for this reaction," he said, looking at the other two."What sort of reaction were—were you expecting?!" Remus gasped out, taking a couple more steps back. Soon he'd be up against a wall."Er..."He slowly shook his head, pain filling him as he tried to push the wolf back down. It was getting very agitated, wanting to protect itself, wanting to lash out and destroy them so it could remain 'safe'. "You are all absolutely nutters!" he got out, wiping off his face again, the tears not stopping. "What next? Is James a vampire?""Remus," Sirius repeated, coming closer. "We know, okay? We know—""Know what?" Now he was snappish, and he regretted the tone. He needed—couldn't, couldn't sound too angry. Had to sound amused. "Is this your newest prank? Going around accusing people of—of—" His voice was rising against his will. It was getting harder to breath, too, and he had to take rapid breaths in. "—of—"But he had no idea what else to say. The panic was taking over."—of—of—"They had found out."—of—"They had found out!His nose itched then burned as he struggled not to sob."—of—of—"He was just stammering the same word over and over. He took one last step back, against the wall now which made the wolf worse. Made him feel trapped.He couldn't breathe at all.He began trembling and pressed his hands against his thighs to try to not be as noticeable.Sirius was saying something but it sounded kinda muffled and distant. It didn't make any sort of impact in Remus's brain so he didn't know how to respond.He didn't know what to do.His head pulsed, and blackness began creeping in at the edge of his vision."Why are you saying this?" Remus asked, glad for at least a second that he was against the wall because without it he thought he might fall over. "Why would you ever say such a thing?!"He knew if he stayed any longer he'd betray the truth."Why say these things?"Of course, they already knew the truth.Had they told anyone?! Was the Ministry on its way right now!?Remus breathed even more rapidly, hyperventilating. His eyes darted towards the window as he debated the pros and cons of trying to scale down the side of the tower. He could possibly use the levitating charm on himself before he hit the ground.Someone was saying something. Something about a werewolf.Someone was saying that word out loud, to Remus, that word out loud!His hands flew to his ears. "Stop it! Stop lying!" he cried out, unable to stop himself.He couldn't see them very well; they were all quite blurry from either the tears or whatever was causing the blackness in his vision, he wasn't sure which. Sirius was standing directly in front of him. He was saying something, probably reiterating the werewolf accusations."STOP IT!"He shouldn't yell."STOP LYING!"He had to stay calm."WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?!"The wolf clawed at his insides, at his soul, his brain, every inch of his every being."WHY WOULD YOU LIE?"He felt it filling his body, bubbling up to the edge, ready to explode."STOP—LYING!"He felt as though he would explode into fur and fangs.Then the need to escape took over and he pushed past Sirius, past James and Peter. He had to just leave, just go away, return home as fast as he could before the Ministry arrived. But he couldn't see the door. He knew deep down that it was behind the curtains they had hung up but for some reason that wasn't connecting in his brain.The wolf felt cagedRemus felt caged.They had locked him in to keep him there until the W.C.U. came.The wolf and Remus felt more like one than ever before, as if their horrible words had erased whatever border was keeping them apart. They butted up against one another in his head and it was more than he could bear. He wanted to scratch at his head until everything spilled out, leaving him empty. He wanted to claw himself to pieces as he did just a few nights before, rip himself apart until there was nothing left.A hand on his shoulder.Remus jerked away, spinning around. "You're wrong," he gasped out. "You're wrong I d-d-don't know wh-huu-why you'd l-l-l-l-lie b-b-b-but—but—but—"This wasn't how things were supposed to go! He had planned for it, planned on just shrugging it off casually if anyone ever accused him! He thought he could. He had genuinely thought it'd be easy. But reality was nothing like he imagined. Was it because it was them? His best, closest friends? Or would he have reacted like this for anyone?Sirius's face swarmed into his vision and he grabbed Remus's upper arms. "Remus!" he said in a firm tone that somehow filtered through all the terror. "Calm down!"Calm down?Calm down?Remus felt the need to lash out at this frail human.No. Not Remus. The wolf wanted to, so bad that he felt a swift urge, his body nearly moving on its own to hurt him—was half a second away from clawing into Sirius's face... but he couldn't, it was Sirius. Even if he knew, even if he told the Ministry... it was still Sirius. Beautiful, funny, idiotic, goofball Sirius, and Remus could never hurt him, never let the wolf hurt him, and it took all of his power to shove the wolf back as hard as he could, to fight with the demon inside of him until he felt that breaking feeling inside his brain, his own self flooding back into his body as the wolf retreated and blood began pouring out of his nose.He gave a choked sound then sank down to the floor, slipping out of Sirius's grip and crumbling into a sobbing heap on the floor.It was too late.They knew, and they had told the Ministry.All he could do was beg to let him go before he was arrested."Please," he sobbed out, curling into a tight ball, covering his face, blood, tears, and snot all mixing together. "Please."He never expected to end up like this, groveling for mercy. Especially not to his previous friends."Please..."He felt arms around him, jarring him out of his begging because why would any of them put their arms around him? But one of them was hugging him. Hugging. Before he could react he felt more arms around him, then another set.All three of them were huddled on the floor around him.He wondered vaguely if they were just trying to keep him in place then that was wiped away by realizing they were hugging him."Please calm down," James was saying. He was kinda muffled but it wasn't as bad as it had been before."It's okay," Sirius said, one set of arms—presumably his—tightened.Peter didn't say anything but he let out a sound that could have been interpreted as sympathetic."It's okay," Sirius repeated. "It's okay, Remy; it's okay. I'm sorry. I—I didn't... mean to..." He trailed off then hugged Remus harder, burying his face into Remus's shoulder.Remus just lay there, unable to comprehend what was happening. He literally didn't understand. Everything inside his head was broken. Because this couldn't be real. It had to be a nightmare. Any minute he'd wake up, probably crying, Sirius climbing into his bed to comfort him. Because this couldn't, couldn't, COULDN'T be what was actually happening in reality.Werewolves were monsters.No twelve year olds would just... accept... and then... touch... hug...Remus began curling again, hands sliding back to his face. His fingers dug into his skin as he gave raspy breaths, entire body shaking. He wanted this to end, to be over, to wake up, for everything to just stop. Stop for a minute, a second, so he could try to sort through what happened. He needed a spell that would just freeze everything including time.Or a way to go back into time, to leave before all this happened, to escape.Except they were hugging him.He made a sound he intended to be 'Why are you acting like this?' but all that came out was a pathetic whimpering sound.Sirius slid back, pulling Remus into a sitting position. "I'm sorry," he said again, staring straight into Remus's watery eyes as he trembled quite violently. "I honestly didn't think you'd react like this."James let go, reaching into his bag and Remus suddenly thought he was reaching in for his potions kit, to the silver knife. That didn't match with what just happened but it's all he could think, and he began shrieking, scrambling away from them, trying to again solve how to leave this cage. Logically James wouldn't be going for the silver knife because he had been hugging Remus, but every inch of Remus could only focus on the fact they all had silver weapons at hand and maybe they hadn't sent a letter to the Ministry, maybe they were just planning on getting rid of him themselves. Almost all of wizarding society hated werewolves. They shouldn't be any different.Remus yelped as he crashed into something. James was frozen where he was crouched by his bag, hand inside. Slowly he pulled a handkerchief out. He kept his eyes on Remus as he reached for the water pitcher, dribbling water onto the handkerchief. Then just as slowly he approached Remus, holding the damp handkerchief out as far as he could reach."Um, here."Remus's chest heaved as he stared at the handkerchief. James knelt down, carefully putting it in one of Remus's hand, then backing away. Remus's fingers curled around the wet cloth. He wasn't sure what to do with it. Sirius finally came over, taking the handkerchief and pressing it against Remus's cheek. Remus flinched back at the touch but Sirius just kept it against his face."It'll maybe help?" Sirius asked gently, taking one of Remus's hand in his (which made no sense, if he knew why would he hold Remus's hand it didn't make any sense) and putting it up against the cloth. Then Sirius sat back on his heels, putting a little bit of space between them.Remus began wiping his face off then opened the handkerchief fully, putting the entire thing against his face. It did feel good, and help give him enough presence of mind to actually speak English."D-did—di-d-did you s-ssu—s-s—summah th—the Mi—the—the Min—Ministry?" he sniveled out into the handkerchief."The Mini...?" Sirius looked at the others then back at Remus. "Why the hell would we summon the Ministry?"Remus let his hands fall, the cloth still in his hand. He just stared at Sirius. "The—th-the d-d-d—du—du-d-d—" He couldn't speak anymore. He pressed the cloth back against his face despite the fact it was quite bloody. "W.C.U.," he finally managed to squeak out."What in Merlin's name is that?" Sirius asked."I have no idea," James said."Me either," said Peter.Remus jerked back when Sirius put his hand back on his arm. "Remy, why would we call the Ministry? What's the W.C.U.?""T... t—to t—ta—take m-m-m-me," he whimpered."Take you?" James asked.They were being purposely obtuse now. "To—take—me!" Remus pushed himself farther from Sirius, away from his burning touch. "To take me!" His fingers twitched, tearing the handkerchief to pieces as if it were a napkin and not actual cloth. He stared down at it, feeling it a little easier to speak when he didn't focus on their faces."Oh. Shit. Oh, Remus, no," Sirius said in an achingly pitying voice that just sent Remus into more tears. "No. We didn't. I promise, we haven't told anyone at all."He let out a shuddered breath, pressing some of the shreds to his face again. He wasn't sure if he believed them, or could believe them. Part of him wanted to believe them but—why wouldn't they tell the Ministry? The tears rolled down his face and he drew his knees up, hugging them tightly, pressing his face down into his arms, body wracking as he cried.Sirius hugged him again. Not, not quite a hug; more like holding Remus against him in a protective manner. "Please come back," he whispered so softly Remus doubted anyone else heard. Remus wasn't even sure he heard Sirius because the sentence didn't make sense.They remained there for what felt like an eternity. Sirius holding Remus as he cried, James and Peter kneeling nearby watching with worry. Finally Remus pulled away from Sirius, wanting to apologize for getting blood all over his uniform. But he knew if he tried to speak he'd just start crying again. Everything was so fuzzy and... everywhere, like lines spasming around inside his brain, filling him with nonexistent noise.He was tired, so tired. The moon really took it out of him this time around, and then this. It was too much.And the pulsing run run run fear pushing at his entire being didn't help.Remus looked up at the others who remained silent, all of them waiting for him to speak, to say something. Or to totally freak out again. He opened his mouth then closed it, clenching his teeth shut. He lifted one hand, pressing it against his forehead. He felt... humiliated, for reacting the way he had but he knew he hadn't been able to control it. He had tried, and failed.They knew he was a werewolf, told him, and he absolutely flipped out. After a lifetime of thinking he could handle being accused, after spending so long convincing himself it'd go okay... after everything his parents drilled into his—Oh.Oh.His parents.He gave a gurgling sort of sound then covered his face again.They had been right.They told him to never make friends because those friends would figure it out, and it happened.He wasn't sure if he'd be able to spend the rest of their lives having them be privately smug about being right. Though... on the bright side, at least he wouldn't be dead. They hadn't called the Ministry, so he'd be able to go home and get out of the country. Do what his mother had mentioned before: go to America and disappear into some Muggle countryside.But first he needed to deal with them. At least he'd probably be able to take all his school stuff with him, instead of just running."You feeling better?" James asked when Remus stirred again, taking his hands from his face.No. How could he possibly feel better? His secret—his horrible, disgusting, vile secret—had been found out. Not told, like the teachers. Though he supposed Dumbledore technically figured out the secret too but that had been different (and felt a lot longer ago than just fifteen or so months!). He'd have to go to Dumbledore and admit everything. Tell him that the others found out—Maybe he could erase their memories. Remus's stomach churned at that thought. It was hellish that they knew but it seemed... worse if their memories were erased. But they would be. Dumbledore would do that, like he had done with Professor Dedenne.Maybe he'd just completely erase Remus from their memories entirely. Or rather, erase the fact they had been friends? But then everyone would know something was up if Remus disappeared and Sirius, James, and Peter had no idea who he was. No, it'd just be his secret.I don't want that. But it didn't matter what he wanted It mattered what was safe. Erasing this would make things safe. Except I'll be leaving so does it matter? He wondered what would happen. If he left, would they go around saying 'Remus Lupin was a werewolf'! No. No, Dumbledore wouldn't even risk that because then he'd be in a lot of trouble for aiding a werewolf.If you ever even imagine they're beginning to question, please come to me immediately. I shall keep you safe, Dumbledore had said at the beginning of September. Yeah, he would definitely erase their memory of Remus's lycanthropy.Then, suddenly, everything caught up to him and he could barely even hold his head up. He was beyond exhaustion. He just stared blankly at his legs until Peter put something in his lap. A bar of chocolate. He just stared at it until Sirius took it, breaking off a corner and putting it into Remus's hand. Remus's hand was shaking pretty hard and the piece fell to the floor. Sirius just broke off another corner and stuck it right into Remus's mouth. He didn't chew, just let it melt for a moment then swallowed the melted chocolate which immediately made him start recovering. He took the bar, broke off his own piece, this time chewing it. Before he knew it he had eaten the entire bar, then a few sticks of licorice wands that James gave him, and a chocolate cauldron cake that Sirius handed over. Peter fetched him a glass of water which he drank down.The numbness began fading, slightly.He wasn't sure what to do now. Apologize? Just start packing?"You with us again?" Sirius asked.Remus shrugged. "I... d... don't... know." He took another sip of water, hand shaking.Sirius got another handkerchief, wetting it so he could start wiping off Remus's face. Remus wanted to pull away, to ask him to stop but even that was too much effort so he just let Sirius clean him off."Your nose was bleeding," James said.Remus merely shrugged again. He took one more sip then set the glass down. "I'm sorry," he whispered, covering his face yet again. "I—I'm s-sorry for—for—" For being an absolute moron, for going completely wild. For being so inhuman."It's okay," Sirius said, rubbing Remus's back. "You don't need to apologize for anything. We're the ones—I'm the one who should be apologizing, and I do. I am. I'm sorry for just throwing this at you, Remy. I honestly just... I knew you... I knew you'd be upset over us knowing but I had no idea it'd be like this.""So, you are a werewolf?" Peter asked. James began laughing so hard he fell over. Peter scrunched his face up. "Hey! He never actually said yes! He never did."Bless Peter, Remus thought, as a tiny, faint smile tugged at the corner of his lips. "No?" he said hoarsely and they all gave him looks."Yes, Pete, he is," Sirius said.Peter looked at Remus who ducked his head, not saying anything. "Okay," Pete finally replied.Remus took in some air, trying to keep his voice steady. "How—l-l—long have... y—you kno—known?""Since Saturday night," Peter said."After the last full moon," James said then frowned. "Well, after you and I made up.""You d-d-didn't know... at the same time?" he asked, surprised. He had sorta assumed they all worked it out together. But now both James and Peter were looking at Sirius."I've known for certain since the end of our first year," Sirius said quietly. "But I guessed it last winter."Remus pulled away from him, staring in disbelief. "What?"Sirius's grey eyes focused on Remus. "I realized something was going on pretty much from the get go. I suspected there was something you weren't telling us. For a while I thought it's what I mentioned to you before. That it was a deadly illness you had, that you were going to die."Remus started to say something but Sirius just kept talking, not letting him speak. "Then over winter I figured out you were disappearing pretty much once a month. You claimed to be sick on other days, but you looked ill only once a month. Regardless of whether you said it was you or your mother. Then after the Easter holidays James told us he met your mother and she looked really healthy; he said it because he hoped that meant you'd be on the upswing too. Eventually I started pressing you about it. I—I'm sorry for doing that too, I shouldn't have."Suddenly Sirius smiled. "When you got that fake silver necklace it really threw me for a loop."Remus blinked then sorta smiled back. "I—I w-w-was worried you were su—suspecting, so I had, er, someone send that to me. But..." He trailed off, biting his lip, looking down. "I was worried you still suspected.""I did," Sirius admitted. "I figured out the silver was fake, and that's what helped me figure it out. It just seemed kinda weird to me. Why would you do something like that? I kinda worked out it was to throw me off the scent."Remus flushed a little, feeling a bit stupid. That was an aspect of the whole thing he hadn't anticipated. "How come you d-didn't say anyth—thing sooner?"Sirius adjusted his sitting position, hand still on Remus's back. "I wanted to be sure-sure. I... was pretty much sure, but I kept putting it off because what if you weren't? I guess I was scared—not—not of you, I mean, but it's a pretty... big thing. Thinking someone's a werewolf. Especially you, since you're so—well, I kept telling myself, let's wait one more full moon to see if that's when he disappears. Then I wanted to wait till after summer because I did not want to do it in a letter, and I didn't want to tell those two about it in a letter, I wanted to wait to be like 'look he's going to disappear on this date and come back on this date'."Since I'm so what? Remus wondered, but asked, "You told them?"Sirius nodded. "Yeah. I was going to tell James in September but you two were fighting, so I waited until after you guys made up. Well, I mean, I sorta told him before. I told him about a week before that I thought I knew what you had, and that you'd get sick around the twenty-second. Which you did, though you insisted your mother was sick. James asked me, while you were gone, what you had and I told him I'd tell him later, which I did. After the make up.""If you kn—knew then wh-why did you guys get so... freaked out when I was sick?" He was mostly asking James."Sirius didn't tell me what you had," he explained. "Just that you'd get sick. It still scared me.""And—and Peter?" Remus asked. It was hard to talk, it felt like slogging through molasses, his entire body felt heavy. Everything pressed down on him and he wanted to just scream not talk!Sirius shrugged. "I decided not to tell Pete until this time around. Which was also when I showed them the evidence.""Evidence? Me b—being sick during the—the moon?" he stammered out."Sorta... I mean, that could really be some super screwed up coincidence I guess," Sirius said. "No, I mean evidence. We used his cloak. Saturday night." Suddenly Remus was utterly terrified they'd say they were in the passage under the Whomping Willow but instead Sirius went on with, "To break into the hospital wing, to your little room. Where you weren't. We asked Pomfrey on Sunday if you were there and she insisted you were. But you hadn't been."Remus tried to wrap his head around the fact Sirius had known for so long. His fears back towards the end of his first year had been right.He should have realized though. All the hints were there. He should have figured out that Sirius did know, but he hadn't, he had just... pretended otherwise, there was no other way of saying it. He denied the evidence and pretended it didn't exist, and now this happened because he was so damn STUPID."So... all th—this time... you've known..." Remus's throat swelled shut. "You... l-lied to me. You pretended."Sirius's silver eyes locked onto his. "How is that any different from what you did?"Remus looked away, heat creeping across his face. "I d—don't understand," he said, fingers twitching, wanting to shred more paper. He began tugging at the bottom of his sweatshirt instead. "If you—you knew then wh-why did you—did you—""Did I what?" Sirius asked, tilting his head to one side."You n-never acted like—like you hated me! Like you thought I was... a-a-a—a..." He swallowed and closed his eyes. "You know.""A werewolf?""A monster," he whispered, shrinking into himself. "A monster. I'm—I'm a monster!"There was silence. Then Sirius moved his hand from Remus's back to his shoulder, squeezing. "Because you're not?"Remus's eyes fluttered open. What?"What?" he asked, confused."I never... thought of you like that, if that's what you're thinking," Sirius said softly. "I was a little scared when I realized but why would I think that?"Remus gaped at him, feeling the numbness coming back."I was the same, when Sirius told me," James said. "Like, I was really surprised cause I had no idea but I never thought of you being a monster. I mean come on, that's completely ridiculous. You're like, the least monster-y out of all of us."Peter was nodding. "I was, um, I was scared and—umm, well kinda still am—" Sirius shot him a dark look which Peter ignored, "—but you're definitely not a monster. At all."Remus looked at them, at their open, honest faces. Their words slowly sank into him. They didn't...They—They didn't see him like—That didn't make any sense though?At all.He wasn't seen as—?He looked at their faces once more, gave a sort of wheezing sound, then promptly burst into a fresh wave of tears as his brain more or less broke due to their reassurance, and he couldn't process anything anymore so tears was pretty much the only available route to go. He couldn't fathom their responses in any way, and slowly wrapped himself around the idea they were just saying it to say it. They couldn't mean it. Or maybe—maybe they didn't understand exactly what a werewolf was?He sniffled loudly, wiping his snotty nose off on his sleeve. That's it, he thought, trying in some shaky breaths of air. They have no idea what a werewolf is. Maybe they just thought... he turned into a wolf but wasn't dangerous.He considered just leaving it as is. Going away and letting them continue to think that way until they were educated by a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. It'd be the safest thing. After all, if he told them the truth which they OBVIOUSLY didn't understand then they'd completely freak out. Possibly try to kill him. But he figured he'd still be able to escape before they summoned the Ministry, and he wanted them to know. He felt... rather uncomfortable by the idea they knew he was a werewolf without even knowing what a werewolf apparently was!He rubbed his eyes off with a patch of clean sleeve, then tried to prepare himself for talking about his deepest, darkest secret that wasn't supposed to ever be talked about.

"I d-d—don't th-think you understand."It was so hard to say those words, to get them out. Remus didn't want to tell them. But he also felt like had had to. It hurt to know they were treating him so kindly because of their own stupidity and misunderstanding. Perhaps he shouldn't, but he had to."Understand what?" James asked."This." Remus propped himself up a bit better, debating whether or not to move away from Sirius. "Me—a... a..." He sucked in air, feeling dizzy. "What I am.""A werewolf?" Sirius asked, sounding a little confused.It was still agony to hear that word spoke so casually by them. He had gotten used to his parents saying it, gotten used to some of the teachers, and of course Pomfrey and Miss Fawley. But hearing these three say it, to use it so—so casually! He rubbed the side of his nose. All he wanted was to curl up under his bed and sleep for weeks. He felt as though he could. "Yes," he said, nausea growing stronger. "You d—don't s-seem to—to underst—stand.""We understand," James said.Remus grit his teeth. "No you d-d-don't!" he snapped, which surprised all of them. "You cl—c-clearly don't, bec—cause if you did you'd know wh—why I asked ab—b—bout the Ministry!""I know the Ministry doesn't like werewolves," James said rather stubbornly."Most people don't," added Peter.Remus balled his hands into fists, feeling so hollow inside. "It's m-m-more than th—that, more than j-just 'doesn't like'!" He shook his head then bent forward, looking down at his hands. There was a smear of chocolate on his right hand. "So—society hates us. S-S-Sirius you sh—should at l—least know how b—bad it is!""Me?" Sirius looked puzzled. "Why me?""Because—because of your ff-family!""What do they have to do with anything?" he asked, eyes narrowing. Remus fell silent. Did Sirius... not know? He assumed Sirius had at least known! "Remus, what in Merlin's name does my family have to do with this?" Sirius demanded.Remus gulped, looking down again. "Elara B—Black," he whispered."Who? Elara? That name sounds fa—oh. Aunt Elara?" Sirius glanced at the other two who were very confused. "My father's sister. She—she died when I was a little kid. What the hell does she have to do with anything? How do you even know her name?" He sounded angry now, rather hurt.Remus didn't want to tell him. Regretted bringing it up. "All I'm s—saying is that—""No, what you're going to say is what my father's sister has to do with any of this," Sirius interrupted.Remus began twisting the hem of his shirt around his fingers. "She w—was... she—" He wasn't sure how to say it, how to explain. "She attacked a—a witch. The... witch's sister... w-was a werewolf and—and protected her, and—and killed. Your, um, aunt. The B-Black family made s-sure she—the, er, werewolf—w-was... um... p-punished." He let out a tiny breath and closed his eyes. "Executed."The room was silent for several seconds. Remus wondered what Sirius would say."Oh... I didn't know that. I won't lie, I knew my family hates werewolves but I mean, they hate everyone that's not a pureblood witch or wizard. How did you kn—wait, it wasn't someone you knew, was it? The—the werewolf?"Remus quickly looked up, shaking his head. "N-n-n-no," he stammered out. "I only f—found out about it l—last year. I, um, met the witch. The sister to the werewolf.""Bloody hell." Sirius pushed his fingers through his hair. "I guess it's stupid to apologize over something like that but I sorta feel I should... I never knew her, I was very little when she died. I knew... my cousin Bellatrix was fond of her, so I just figured Aunt Elara was always..." He twirled his finger in a circle around his temple, making a cuckoo sort of whistle. "So, you were told this story about my family and didn't hate me? Or—or was that around the time you tried to avoid us? In October?""N—no, it was after we be—became friends," Remus admitted. "And why would I hate you? It wasn't you. I've s-said before, you're nnn-not your family.""Well, why would I hate you because you're a werewolf?" Sirius snapped right back.Remus scowled at that, ducking his head. "B-b-because having f-family th—that does awful stuff is v-v-very d—different than being awful!""You? Awful?" Peter finally broke into the conversation. He and James had been quiet during the exchange between Sirius and Remus, but this was apparently too much. "How are you awful?""Yeah, why would we think you're a monster?" James said, folding his arms.Remus tugged harder at his shirt. "Th—that's what I am t-t-trying to explain that—that—you don't understand! I am a monster. I—" He stopped then struggled to get to his feet, stumbling over to his trunk where he kept all his books. He weakly pawed through them until he found Fantastic Beasts. "This—this is me!" He flipped through then brandished the werewolf page. There was a very realistic drawing of a werewolf creeping along the top of a hill under a full moon. "Five-X! W—with dragons and—and giant spiders and b-b-basilisks!"James took the book from his hand, snapping it shut. "That's not what I see in front of me."Remus glared, swaying a bit. "It d-d-doesn't matter, it's what I am! I'm c—classified as a beast! The M-M-Ministry views me as a—a beast! Wh-when I was so af-f-fraid of you t-telling the Ministry it was because I w-was t-trying to figure out if I had t-time to escape before they sh—showed up to take me and kill me!"The words had the result he desired. Peter and James had open mouths, just staring at him. Sirius looked uncomfortable, as if he already grasped that part of the situation or some of it."K... kill?" James asked.Remus sank back down to the floor, too tired to remain standing. "Yes," he said softly, scratching at the floor. "Kill. The Ministry t-tends to execute w—werewolves who are actively around p-people. Especially kids." He gave a small wail and covered his face with his hands. "Like—like me c-coming here. I wasn't ever even s-supposed to—to come here and I shouldn't—""To Hogwarts?" Sirius interrupted, sounding taken aback. "You weren't supposed to come here?""My f—father told D-Dumbledore to t-t-take me off the list. But—Professor Dumbledore... sh—showed up at our house before our f-first year and realized what I was, and—and insisted he could make things s-safe for me to attend school." He let his hands slide down into his lap, returning to twisting his shirt into his fingers. "It t-t-took forever to c-convince my p—parents that it'd be okay.""But why?" Peter asked.Remus's temper began flaring up. "Aren't you listening!? I'm a monster! Nobody c—can know about me! I'll be killed!" He pushed himself back to a standing position, swaying. "Just because you lot are too st-stupid to understand that doesn't make it any less true!""Stupid?" James folded his arms. "We aren't stupid."Remus now clutched at his hair, tugging. "Obviously you because you don't understand! You don't understand! The fact you had no idea why I asked a—about the Ministry p-proves you don't!""Remy, I had no idea why you asked about the Ministry not cause I didn't understand," Sirius said, a touch frostily, "it's because it's us. Why would we betray you? Why would we—""You would, if you underSTOOD!" Remus snapped back, getting really angry at their flippancy!"Then make us understand, if you're so insistent we don't!" Sirius retorted."I'm trying!" He gave his hair one more tug then began pacing, trying his best not to collapse. "Okay, wh—what do you know about w—werewolves?""You turn into a wolf during the full moon," James said."We know that the general population despises you," Sirius added with a shrug."And you look super crappy right before and after the moon," Peter said, looking proud he had something to add.Remus looked at all of them. "That's it? That's all you know?" He pinched the bridge of his nose, head pounding. He should have just started packing to leave, shouldn't have gone down this rabbit hole. But he also had the itch to educate them, to make them know. "If—if I came across any of you while a—a—during the full moon, I'd... I'd kill you. Okay? I'd—I'd rip you apart. I have no... humanity... as a wolf. I have no control, nothing. All I w-want to do is—is attack, and destroy, and hurt. That's why we—we're dangerous, we literally kill, want to kill, that is what we are! A instrument of violence and death!"He gave them each a look, waiting for a response. It just wasn't the response he expected."You want to do that to us now?" Sirius asked."No! No! Of—of—of—of course not!" Remus cringed back at the very thought, at the fleeting feelings of violence he had had moments ago. "I swear, I promise I w-w-w-would never do that! Many people th—think we're animals even when we l-look human but—""Okay, so if you don't want to do it to us now then why are you a monster?" Sirius said, cutting him off. Remus's mouth shut. "If it's only when you turn into something else, why does that mean you're a monster?""And even if you do that as a wolf, it's not like you have control over it, right?" James inquired. "You said no control so...?""...no..." he admitted. "I d—I—I d-d-don't have any... c-control... but—""So, it's not you, and not your fault?" James looked at Sirius who began nodding in agreement."Exactly," Sirius agreed, the conversation going in entirely the wrong direction! "A monster—well, in my opinion—is someone who has control over what they do to others and choose to cause pain. If you have no... human thought... as a wolf... and no control then that's just—it's not the same thing.""Yeah, cause like wild animals attack people but it's not like they do it on purpose," Peter said. "They don't have, um, the—the thoughts we do, the, um, brains and stuff. And the creatures that do, they don't go around hurting people on purpose.""Like the pyrabbits!" exclaimed James. "They don't set the fires to intentionally set fires, it's just part of their... errrmm, bi—biology. Is that the right word?" he asked Remus who gave a vague nod. "It's built into them, they can't help it. That's what it's like for you, right? You don't intentionally want to attack people when you're a wolf, it's just biology. Right?""That—th—that—that is not the point!" he squeaked, wondering how on earth the conversation had gotten completely out of hand. How could they listen to his words and then disregard them entirely? "The point is I'm—""You're not a monster," Sirius said, not letting Remus finish the sentence. "You're at worse a snarky little shit."Remus folded his arms angrily, feeling it was futile to get them to understand. They were obviously refusing to accept reality."Stop scowling. I know what the Ministry thinks, what most people think. But it's not what I think." Sirius stepped closer, putting his hands on Remus's shoulders. "I don't care what everyone else says what werewolves are because they're obviously wrong. You're not evil, or bad, or whatever you seem to think about yourself. You're—you're smart, and good, and funny.""You're weird but not in a bad way," James said with a smile, pushing his glasses up. "You're very talented, too. You're the most talented at Hogwarts, hands down.""And super nice," Peter added. "I mean, really nice. And so helpful, I would never have gotten any of the grades I've gotten without your help.""And a nerd, you're a total nerd, we can't forget that," Sirius said with a grin. "The nerdiest nerd.""And brilliant, completely brilliant! Even if you do get so distracted you forget how to get dressed or walk into walls," James continued."And you're really supportive, the most out of any of us I think! You even go to James's practices even though you hate Quidditch, and you help all of us and never seem mad about helping us," Peter said.Sirius had kept his hands on Remus's shoulder during all this and now he squeezed. "Remus, you're our friend. We care about you, and none of us see you as a monster, okay? And we're not stupid for thinking that way!"Remus felt unable to even pretend to respond; he just sorta stood there in shocked, confused silence until Sirius put his arms around him, hugging, and James and Peter scrambled over to hug him too. He finally reacted, putting shaking hands up to his face as he began crying once more. Remus was glad they were holding him because he lost sense of everything. It seemed like he was being dragged all over the place mentally and emotionally, had checked out multiple times already, and was now gone again because he couldn't understand why they would say so many nice things to him, still sorta thought that they didn't get it. Even if they chalked it up to 'biology' or 'instinct' or whatever, it didn't—didn't matter because it was still him, even if he wasn't aware it was still him...Wasn't it?He was adrift in a sea of bewilderment, only dimly aware of the door opening, of Spinnet crashing through the curtains, swearing, of him seeing the four Marauders standing in the middle of the room in a huddling hug, of Sirius telling him to bugger off, of Spinnet saying he didn't want to know what was going on, and then leaving. James detached himself from the huddle so he could relock the door, replace the muffling curtains.Then Remus couldn't stand another second longer. "I'm so tired," he moaned, going back down to the ground since Sirius and Peter's arms had gone loose when James broke the literally could not think about them and their words because it was a great big burning sun of confusion in his brain. He felt like there was nothing left inside of him other than that burning sun he couldn't look at, that every little bit had been shredded into dust and blown away."You should rest," Sirius said, crouching down next to him, rubbing his arm. "You're never well after the—the full moon, so you should rest. We can talk about anything we need to talk about later.""No... no..." Remus slowly swung his head back and forth. "Need to... pack.""Pack?" Sirius's head jerked up. "For what?"Remus didn't answer, didn't want to explain. He shouldn't have even brought it up. "Nothing. I—I should rest. You should go to supper." He wasn't even sure if it was time for supper, or if it was after. Ever since the Marauders had come back to the dorm time had ceased to exist for Remus."Pack for what?" James asked."Come on, what are you meaning?" Sirius asked, going back to rubbing his arm.Remus moaned a little, tucking his chin down against his chest. "I... c—can't stay," he croaked out."What?!" all three of them shouted. James and Peter were on their knees around him too, all of them just right up in his personal space."What are you talking about?" Sirius asked darkly. Remus just whimpered. "Remy come on, what do you mean you can't stay?""You—you know," he forced out. "I can't stay. I have to leave and—and—""But why?" Pete asked.Remus sucked in some air then coughed, choking on his own spittle. He jerked away from them, flopping onto the ground. He could see himself in their eyes: a pathetic lump. "I can't stay," he repeated. "I can't, it's not safe!""But... don't others know?" James asked. "You said Dumbledore knows, and I'm guessing Pomfrey knows."Remus nodded. "Yeah, and a couple others but—but that's different. They're teachers, you're not, and when my parents find out you know it's gonna be so bad, and I—it's just not safe. I have to go, we'll have to leave the country. It's what I tried to say earlier!" He pushed himself back into a sitting position, nearly throwing up from the movement. "I'm a hated creature, and if it gets out I'm a werewolf at Hogwarts I'll just be executed and—""We're not gonna tell anyone!" Sirius said, quite loud; nearly a bellow. "Merlin! You really think we're going to tell anyone? I said before, why the hell would any of us betray you?! I only told James and Peter because it's us, we're the Marauders!""I am never telling anyone, I swear," James said."Me either, why would we let this out?" Peter asked dolefully. "Bloody hell, we're best friends.""More than friends," James said. "We're the Marauders. That's more than friends any day."Sirius and Peter nodded in agreement to James's statement, and normally Remus would have agreed... but... it was different now."It d-d-doesn't matter!" Remus wanted them to just leave, to stop saying it'd be okay. They didn't... they couldn't... they were refusing to get it. "When my parents find out anyone knows besides the agreed to list Dumbledore insisted on, they will flip out! They will not allow me to stay in the country, much less Hogwarts!"Sirius grabbed hold of Remus's flailing arm, holding him still. "Then why do they have to know we know?" he asked.Remus blinked a few times, the question like a hammer to his skull. "Not... tell... my—my parents...?""Yeah, if they're just gonna take you away then why tell them we know?" James asked with a shrug.Remus's eyes darted between them then down at his lap. Not tell his parents? Not tell them!? Three twelve year olds knowing his secret and—and not tell them? He started to say something, then stopped. Then opened his mouth again, then closed it."Look, we don't have to let anyone know we know," Sirius said soothingly. "A Marauder secret. The biggest Marauder secret.""We'll all take oaths, if that helps," suggested James."N... nn... no, no, no it—it's not safe, it's not s-safe!""Why not?" Sirius asked. "Why is Pomfrey knowing safe but not us?""Because you're—you're kids!" he cried out, exasperated.To his confusion Sirius just began laughing. "What!? Remy—Remy, we're your age!""Yes, but—" He hesitated, trying to figure out how to explain. "You haven't spent your whole life with this! It's... not part of you!""If it's part of you, it's part of us," James said without any hesitation. "Um, not in the same way obviously. Oof, I didn't mean it like that. I know it's not part of us. Let me try again. You're part of us. I'd die to keep your secret a secret. I swear."Remus chewed at his bottom lip. Not tell anyone? Not let anyone know that they knew? Could he even do that?He... had kept his friends a secret from his parents... could he also keep this a secret? Though, as long as he was able to keep them being his friends a secret he'd be able to keep them KNOWING a secret. But this was beyond having friends. This was his secret, his secret-secret! He couldn't just let this slide, things continuing the way they had been... as if they didn't know...But Sirius had known for a while and never said anything. He did tell James and Peter but that... didn't surprise Remus or even bother him. In fact, if it was just Sirius who knew that might have made it worse."Hey." Sirius tugged Remus up to his feet. "How about this. How about you get some rest, then we can talk more later. Tomorrow morning, even. Then if you still feel like you need to leave we'll understand."No we won't!" James growled."Yeah, don't speak for all of us!" Peter snapped.Sirius glared back at them. "I think Remus just needs to rest right now. We've ambushed him with all this and look, he's barely able to stay up." Remus was swaying and if Sirius wasn't holding him he'd definitely fall. Sirius carefully guided him over to his bed. "Go back to sleep, okay? Get some rest."Remus wanted to protest he wasn't a child, he didn't need to be treated like this. The only noise he was able to make was a whiny sort of sound as Sirius maneuvered him into bed, tucking him in like Pomfrey had on Sunday."We'll bring you some supper so don't worry about that, okay?"Remus didn't respond. Sirius gave him a strange look then shut the curtains. Remus struggled to remain awake because they began talking, and he wanted to know what they had to say. Plus he had to think, had to stay up and think..."Whaddaya mean he can leave tomorrow?" James immediately hissed out, trying to keep his voice low. They didn't know werewolves had superior hearing, didn't know Remus could hear him."We can't force him to do anything," Sirius replied miserably. "Look, I want him to stay. I—I think he will. He's just so tired right now. He needs to sleep. I think after sleep he'll feel better.""Or maybe he'll just run off as soon as we go down to supper?" Peter asked huffily."That's why I'm staying here," Sirius told him. "You guys can go eat then bring some food up for me and Remus when you come up to get your broom for practice, James. If you don't mind.""No. I don't mind," sighed James. "I think you're right. He looked so... why do you think he lost weight?""I don't know. He's never lost weight like that before, not that I've noticed at least," said Sirius. "I'm really worried. We should have waited to talk to him tomorrow. I think all of this was too much.""Remy wouldn't ever let it go, if he suspected we were up to something without telling him," James said. "He knew something was up.""Why do you think he thinks he's a monster?" Peter asked, out of no where."Probably cause that's what most people say," James answered."He's right, if the Ministry found out about him he'd be..." Sirius trailed off then sucked in some air. "He'd be executed.""But why would he be killed!?" Peter cried out. "He's a human being!""Not according to the Ministry," Sirius explained. "To the Ministry he's a five-X beast, a dangerous creature. Werewolves aren't supposed to be part of society. There's even a 'reservation' for some of them.""How do you know all this?" Peter asked, a little suspiciously. Remus was wondering the same thing; it seemed Sirius knew a little more than Remus thought he did."Because once I figured out he was one I did a lot of research into it, and I talked to my Uncle Alphard over summer too," Sirius said. Remus felt terrified at that, but then Sirius went on to say, "I never said I knew one, just said I was curious because there wasn't much info about them in Fantastic Beasts. Uncle Alphard told me about the reservation. There's also a list at the Ministry, for something about registered werewolves. I don't know much about that though.""So if the Ministry finds out about him they'll register him then put him in a reservation?" Pete asked."I... doubt it," Sirius replied gravely. "I mean, I admit I never thought about what the Ministry might do to him. I knew it was bad I just never thought how bad... but you heard him... the Ministry kills werewolves who are around people.""He thought we told the Ministry," Peter muttered."Yeah that surprised me too," Sirius said. "I thought he'd know us better than that but—I guess I didn't think it through it enough. I didn't expect him to think that at all."Nobody spoke for several seconds and Remus nearly fell asleep then jerked awake when James spoke up. "I hope he trusts us.""I hope he does too," said Peter."Me three," sighed Sirius. "But that's his choice. And if he decides he can't trust us... well, there's nothing we can do."There were some sounds that Remus figured was them taking the curtains down, then the door opened and shut. He heard Sirius get settled in his bed, and music started playing quietly. Remus rolled over, eyes fluttering shut even though he wanted to stay awake to try and think over everything, but he was just too tired and sleep dragged him into the darkness.

Author's Note: I had to get an extra chapter out this week, I couldn't leave you hanging till Friday! ;) also I want to say since I know it's been on a lot of people's minds: Fawley. Remus just is not in the right state of mind right now to be thinking about that. Don't worry, he'll realize soon, he's just way too out of it to think about the fact she'd be able to see all this at the moment./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus didn't sleep well at all. He was plagued with nightmares and kept tossing and turning. None of the nightmares were very solid, just vague sort of feelings of terror and dread. He finally woke up with a cry of fear and hunched over, crying into his hands. He had been so stupid, so stupid! His parents were right."Remus?""I'm f—fine," he lied as the curtains opened. He wasn't even sure how long he had been asleep. He felt as though he hadn't gotten even a second of rest. "I just want to be alone right now. Please."To his surprise Sirius nodded. "All right. If you need anything, I'm here." He shut the curtains and went back to his own bed.Remus sniffled and then curled back up, rubbing his face against his pillow. For another moment he dwelled on his own stupidity until he fell asleep again, only to wake right back up with muffled sobs. This time Sirius didn't bother him. He buried his head underneath his pillow, trembling, wishing Sirius had left so he could leave. He should leave, he couldn't stay! They knew! He could NOT remain at Hogwarts with three students knowing what he was! It wasn't safe. It was a dangerous folly, and he needed to get out as soon as possible.He fell back sleep then jerked awake, feeling as though it was a covered full moon. When he remained human all night he never got much sleep since it was all like this. He shifted around, pummeled his pillow weakly, turned his blanket over so it wasn't as damp from his sweat, and then fell back asleep only to wake back up a few moments later. He curled into a ball, clutching his head, wondering how he hadn't seen this coming! Had he been that blinded by his friendship? His own cockiness? He had thought Sirius suspected but then denied it. Why?Because he didn't treat you any different, he thought miserably. You assumed if he suspected or knew he'd hate you. Why doesn't he hate you? Why don't any of them hate you? He truly did not understand that at all. If they had known for a long time maybe he'd get it...Their words came flooding back into him. Their compliments, their feelings. Them insisting he was good and all the other stuff. It made his head hurt, and his heart ache. He began crying again, very quietly. Stop crying, you need to stop crying! You're not a baby! But he couldn't stop himself. And this time Sirius came over again, not opening the curtains but asking if he needed company. Remus told him no, he still wanted to be alone, and Sirius returned to his bed.Remus got Gwyllgi out, clinging to him like a life preserver. He continued to sleep on and off until James and Peter came back from supper, which woke him up pretty much fully except he pretended to be asleep, not feeling like eating even though he was starving, and even though he knew he HAD to eat to regain some of the lost weight.He heard them talking, murmuring about how worried they were, wondering what he would say when he did 'wake up'. Peter kept saying he hoped Remus wouldn't leave, James kept insisting he wouldn't, and Sirius remained silent for the most part during their exchange. Then finally James and Peter left, for James's practice. At first Remus hoped Sirius left too but after a few moments he heard the music playing again."Remus? Hey, you should probably eat." This time Sirius did open the curtains. He had a tray with him, a variety of food filling it up."Not hungry," Remus whimpered, curling into a tighter ball. "Just want to be alone." Unfortunately his stomach growled very loudly just then.Sirius snorted and climbed onto the foot of the bed. "Come on."Remus tried to push Gwyllgi under his pillow as casually as he could then sat up, allowing Sirius to put the tray in his lap. "I am a monster, you know," he said, glaring at Sirius, defying him to say otherwise.Which he did. "Not in my opinion," he replied rather cheerfully. "And I don't particularly like the fact you're accusing my best friend of being a monster. It's very rude." Remus grunted then began poking at the baked chicken. "You don't have to leave, you know. We won't tell anyone. And you don't have to tell anyone that we know.""It doesn't work that way," Remus grumbled."So you have to tell your parents everything? You can't keep secrets from them?"Remus flushed slightly, wondering if Sirius had any idea that the Marauders were, in fact, a giant secret from his parents! "N—no. I mean—yes. No to—to the f-first, yes to the—I, I can keep secrets from them but I... can't keep this to myself," he said, stirring the rice miserably. He wanted to say more but still felt too tired. Sirius seemed to realize this as he urged Remus to 'just eat' and 'we can talk later'. Remus ate the entire plate and Sirius took the tray while Remus disappeared back under the covers. The food had really helped. He felt a lot better, and was able to drift into sleep without much issue./\/\/\/\/\He continued to have nightmares, waking up multiple times at the slightest thing. Nobody bothered him, not even when James and Peter returned to the dorm. The only thing any of them said to him was asking if he was all right when he went to the bathroom. At around midnight when he woke up (after an extremely horrifying, gut-wrenching, body-shaking, blood-curling nightmare) the situation slammed into him like a tidal wave. He felt a scream rising up in his throat despite being wide awake, and struggled to keep it down or at least quiet. His body shook violently as realization seeped through his brain of just how much he had screwed up, and he let out a cry of terror, tears rolling down.Sirius was at his bedside almost instantly but Remus couldn't stop panicking to tell him to go away. It's happened, they know, it's over, I was wrong, I was stupid, I messed up, I completely messed up! He began breathing rapidly making squeaking wheezy sounds. The panic had completely taken over, there was nothing but hysteria that he couldn't control."Remus? Remus calm down, come on, calm down!" Sirius said, looking frightened at what he found when he opened the curtains."No—no—no—no!"He took in gulping breaths, trying to breath properly because he was starting to get dizzy. His voice pitched higher, and he wheezed loudly. He was being loud enough—or perhaps it had been Sirius—that the others began waking up which just made the freakout even worse. Remus began choking from the inability to breathe, clawing at his own throat, and Sirius was starting to panic too."Remus!" He grabbed Remus's arms. "Look at me! Come on, it's okay! Breathe!""What's going on?""What happened?"Spinnet started to say something angry then realized just how bad a condition Remus was in and snapped his mouth shut."Is he hyperventilating?" Struthers asked."Call Pomfrey!" said James fearfully."Put his head between his legs!" suggested Peter, hopping from foot to foot.Struthers rushed over, bumping Sirius out of the way who protested furiously. "Breathe into your hands!" Struthers commanded but Remus couldn't even really hear him that well. Everyone was watching him. His panic grew worse. Struthers took Remus's hands, shaping them into cups, putting them against his mouth."Let go of him!" Sirius snapped, trying to tug Struthers way.Struthers just pushed Sirius away with one arm, keeping his other hand on Remus's hands, keeping them in their cupped position around his mouth mostly since Remus's hands were shaking so hard he couldn't keep them there himself. "Someone get a damp cloth," Struthers said in a commanding voice. Sirius realized that Struthers was trying to help and turned to get what he asked for but James had already darted out of the room. Struthers tried taking his hand away but Remus's hands jerked around so he quickly put his hands back, keeping Remus's hands cupped around his mouth for him. By the time James returned with a wet washcloth Remus's breathing had started to get a little under control. The cold dampness on his forehead helped a lot.Slowly Struthers let go and Remus was able to keep his hands in place more or less then he finally let them drop down, breathing fairly normally now, albeit with a bit of a whimper every time he exhaled. He was still pretty shaky though."How did you know to do that? Fix his breathing without magic?" James asked, in slight awe."He was hyperventilating," Struthers said, sounding a bit awkward. "I didn't have a paper bag but I thought I remembered that you could use your own hands."Sirius clapped Struthers on the shoulder. "Thank you," he said then turned to Remus. "You doing any better?"Remus shook his head, some tears slipping down. He could breathe all right but it was still overwhelming; he was soaked in sweat, still felt very lightheaded, and everything was pressing down against him; his skin was scrape-y and he wanted to just scream until everything stopped. He ducked his head low, hands curled over his head, fingers digging into his scalp. He wanted to leave, get away from everyone. He had to. It was for the best anyway. He also wanted to take his anger out on the other Marauders, for forcing him to have to deal with this, for forcing him into this position!"Can't," he said, the word slipping out without him meaning to. "Can't, please—no." He didn't even know what he was saying, it was coming out unbidden. He began breathing hard again."Maybe you should take him to Madame Pomfrey?" Spinnet suggested in a tone that made it clear he expected the other Marauders to yell at him. "He just came back today, maybe he wasn't completely better?"At least he wasn't calling Remus crazy. He thought if he heard that word right now he'd shatter."Remy, do you want to go to Pomfrey?" James asked gently.Remus couldn't answer, he was just clutching at his head, trying his hardest to try to be normal, to try to control himself, to try to stop this flood of emotions that was carrying him off into the abyss. He felt detached from reality, from his own body. It was getting worse with everyone crowding around him. And three of them knew the truth, knew what he was! He gave a hiccuping sob and nearly fell off his bed, but James managed to catch him."Um, I think we should," Peter said anxiously.James helped Remus down to the common room. He tried to insist he would be fine because he didn't want to cause more problems but he couldn't form words on his own. "W—wait please," he finally managed to get out, pulling from James and falling into an armchair. Pressing his face down into the cushions helped him focus enough to speak. "Want to be—alone right now.""I don't think you should be left alone," Sirius said, running his fingers through his hair. "You're not doing well."Whose fault is that? he wanted to snap, but managed to keep quiet. It really wasn't their fault he was reacting like this. He wasn't even sure if it was his own fault. He recalled when Dedenne let loose a torrent of hate he had completely snapped and faded out of reality; he was doing it again. Was it really him? Or the wolf? Fawley had said there were loads of mental issues regular people had so maybe it was just him. He just wished if part of him checked out like this the rest of him would too. It wasn't fair to be left in reality with half his brain disappearing into nothingness.He flinched back when Pete put a hand on his arm. "You look terrible. Please go to Pomfrey."Remus shook his head. He wanted to go to Dumbledore, go home, go back to his mother and stay safe in her arms forever. Like he should have done in the first place. He shouldn't even be here, it was ridiculous, it was absolutely ridiculous to think a werewolf could come safely to school! He should never have come.He yelped as arms went around him; Sirius scooped him right up out of the armchair without trouble. "L—let go!""I'll let go when we get to the hospital wing," Sirius growled. "You're not okay."Remus wriggled, trying to get away from him but he had a pretty good grip. "Please, it's nothing that—that she can help with!"Sirius looked down into his face, his brow wrinkled. "Remus, you haven't stopped shaking, you've gone pale and grey, and you're obviously in a bad state! It's my fault this is happening and I'm not just going to sit back and let you work yourself into another fit!" His voice then dropped to a soft tone. "Please, let me take you to Pomfrey.""F—fine but I can walk."Sirius set him down though he did need help walking, which was quite embarrassing. They left the common room, carefully heading down the hallway, their slippers shuffling along the stone floor. They were all in pajamas except for Remus who had never changed out of the clothes he had been wearing when he went to the Hogsmeade house on Saturday. Sirius kept his arm firmly around his waist as they went, keeping him upright the multiple times his legs gave out or he tripped. Everything was beginning to feel foggy. His head pulsated and he forced back bile.What do I do? he wondered with each painful step. His head grew worse as he tried to think so he gave up for the time being. Then the next thing he knew he was on James's back and they were on the fourth floor. "What... happened?""You collapsed," Peter said."Oh." He didn't remember, didn't remember being on the verge of passing out. He had just... collapsed right there in front of them. How much more could he humiliate himself? "I can walk.'"Sirius let out a laugh that had no amusement in it. "I don't bloody well think so.""Please, put... James, put me down.""Why, so you can collapse again?" James asked.Remus scowled but felt too foggy to really protest any further. The weight pressing against him made everything too difficult. He was having a hard time seeing, too, though that might have been due to the fact the only light they had was Peter's wand. He was having a hard time doing much of anything. His entire being felt dark and cold, and he hoped that whatever was going on would pass in time. What if he stayed like this forever? Terrified, panicked, freaking out every ten seconds? What if he was actually, properly, legitimately broken? He had felt broken for so long but what he now he truly was? He dropped his head against James's head, tightening his arms a little. James hitched him up a bit, getting a better hold.A few minutes later they arrived at the doors to the hospital wing. Sirius pushed them open and they crept in, feeling strange to be there so late. There was a patient asleep in one of the beds so they tiptoed across the floor as quietly as they could. Sirius knocked on Pomfrey's door, trying not to be too loud but not wanting to be too quiet.Pomfrey appeared a moment later, tying her nightrobe closed. "What in Merlin's name—? Mr. Potter? Mr.—" She stopped, seeing Remus limp on James's back. "Mr. Lupin?""He had a nightmare," Sirius explained. "A really bad one. He—well, I don't know what's wrong exactly.""Bring him into my office," she said, turning on the lights.Soon Remus was deposited in a fluffy armchair where Pomfrey began looking him over. She asked what happened and he tried not to look at his friends. "Nightmare." Then he swallowed, closing his eyes. "Bad."Pomfrey straightened up, going over to a large cupboard, getting out potions. "What exactly happened?" Sirius, James, and Peter all shifted from foot to foot, avoiding her gaze. "I need someone to tell me.""He had a nightmare," Sirius said, very unhelpfully.Pomfrey made a 'tsk' sound as she poured some thick milky looking fluid into a spoon then forced the medicine into Remus's mouth and even though it tasted absolutely disgusting he obediently swallowed, shuddering."It was really bad," Remus managed to say as he started to suddenly feel a little calmer. "I c—couldn't... think. Hyper—hyp—hyper—""He hyperventilated," James provided. "David Struthers had him breathe into his own hands to help him and it seemed to work, but then he was shaking bad—Remy, not Struthers—and was crying and since he just got out of here a few hours ago we thought it'd be a good idea to bring him back."Remus was startled at the mention of being in the hospital wing, then wondered what he expected them to say. Did he really think they'd just say they knew he had been a wolf twenty-four hours ago?"I'd like to speak with him privately," Pomfrey said and the other three left without any protest. "Remus?" She knelt down in front of him, looking into his face. "What happened?"This would be the perfect time to admit the truth, admit that they had found out. She'd get Dumbledore and he'd fix everything. Instead he said, "It w-was a nightmare. Really bad. I—I dreamed the Ministry f—found out and—and executed me." It was extremely difficult to talk, and his throat tightened, preventing him from saying more lies. Why did I do that? I should have told her."You've gone into shock," she explained, hand touching his forehead. "Not as bad as it could be but quite dangerous considering the state you were in when you left the hospital wing. I shouldn't have let you go back."Remus wanted to laugh at that, wondering how he would have reacted if all of this came out in the morning after he had had rest? He probably would have been better able to get through, fob off their accusations. Then he realized he was laughing, judging from Pomfrey's very concerned expression. He gave a hiccup and closed his mouth, fighting off the urge to now vomit.She gave him some more medicine then handed him pajamas. He just clutched the fabric helplessly until she helped him get undressed. He was just in his underwear when someone knocked at the door. It was Professor McGonagall. Pomfrey told her to hold a moment then quickly got the pajamas onto Remus. Then she opened the door."Mr. Lupin's not doing well," she said, helping Remus out of her office. She glanced at the other Marauders then back at McGonagall who was eyeing Remus with some surprise. It seemed she had not expected him to actually be in distress. Apparently Filch had seen the four Marauders 'creeping' into the hospital wing so he had fetched her, to make sure they got into major trouble, and she had been expecting them to be causing trouble... not one of them actually needing Pomfrey! Especially Remus!"He'll be staying here tonight," Pomfrey said very firmly even though McGonagall could tell Remus wasn't doing well, "and I suggest he not attend classes in the morning. Perhaps not at all tomorrow.""Very well," McGonagall said then turned to Sirius, James, and Peter. "It appears that you were telling the truth as to why you were out of bed in the middle of the night!""We wouldn't lie," James said and McGonagall gave a soft scoff."I'll take you back to the tower.""We're not in trouble?" Peter asked as they went to the doors."No, you did the right thing.""Are we going to get points awarded, then?" James inquired hopefully."I wouldn't go that far, Mr. Potter. Come along."Once the doors swung shut Pomfrey got Remus into one of the beds. "I can't promise you won't have another nightmare, but one of the potions I gave you should help you sleep," she said as she repeated the diagnostic spells she had done in her office, to see if his blood pressure and other stuff had changed for the better. It seemed that they had since she gave a nod."Th-thank you."She gave his head a slight pat then left him on his own. He tugged the blanket up, staring into the darkness. He felt pretty groggy, but doubted he'd be able to get to sleep any time soon. His mind was whirling too much, panic still clutching at him even though the calming potion was working decently well. At least he didn't feel as on-the-edge as he had earlier although he thought he might cry.He wanted to think about his friends and everything they said however the only thing that went through his mind was how he could possibly have become such a blob of craziness. It wasn't fair. He didn't think he was crazy, not that crazy—except he certainly had acted like a complete cracked cauldron, all sense dribbling out. He wrapped his arms around himself, wishing not for the first time that he had someone he could talk to. Someone who would understand, sympathize. Not someone who would require action. He couldn't tell his parents, couldn't tell Dumbledore, couldn't tell McGonagall, couldn't tell Fawley! He should. But then they'd know the Marauders knew and everything would go wrong.His secret, known to three second years. His friends, yes. The Marauders, yes. But... he had to tell someone...Right?He rolled over onto his other side, yanking one of the pillows close, burying his face against the cool pillowcase. But what if the adults don't know? whispered a voice deep down in his mind. What if you stay here... and your friends know... and nobody knows that they know...?Remus closed his eyes tightly, wanting to shut his ears to that temptation. It was wrong.It was wrong!And not safe at all.Remus curled into a ball, shutting his eyes tightly until lights danced on the inside of his eyelids and then there was a brief stab of fear involving Fawley but he couldn't focus, couldn't think about what it might be. It felt like something small and lost in deep water, so he let it go and drifted into sleep.

Remus woke up with a start, blinking in confusion at the white walls and pale grey curtains around him. He frowned then settled back, rubbing his forehead. Hospital wing, he reminded himself. It was the main room, not the little room he was usually in. He lay still for a few minutes as the previous night swept over him. It almost felt like a physical pull at his limbs and heart.He took in a deep breath—slowly—then let it out. In. Out. Stay calm, he thought. It's going to be all right. He didn't believe his own thoughts, as hard as he tried. But he couldn't go back to what he was like last night. Ohhh! He slid down in the bed, covering his face, burning with embarrassment over what his friends had witnessed. He had felt shame the previous night but not as bad as this!"Mr. Lupin?" He jerked upright as Madame Pomfrey came over with a breakfast tray, pushing back the curtain. "How are you feeling this morning?""Better," he said, shifting himself into a better position as she set the tray in his lap. It smelled amazing."You look a lot better. Actually, you look quite flushed." She did a quick temperature spell, but of course he didn't have one, he was just embarrassed!Remus ducked his head, trying not to blush even more as he took the fork and knife. "Thank you f-for everything, Madame Pomfrey. I really appreciate it. I—I'm sorry I woke you up in the middle of the night.""It's fine, that is precisely why I'm here," she said, tucking her wand away. "I only regret I let you leave yesterday. I thought you would be all right."Remus just shrugged, scooping up a big bite of eggs. "I would have been if—" He stopped then put the eggs in his mouth, giving him some time to focus on lying. "If I hadn't had the—the nightmare," he finished, keeping his eyes on the food so she wouldn't possibly notice any deception. Why are you not telling her? he wondered, getting some bacon. You need to tell her, tell someone. They can't know, you can't stay.Then the defiant voice from just before he had gone to sleep before: Why not?He swallowed rather heavily."I'll come back in to check on you once you're done eating." With that Pomfrey went to take care of the other patient in the room, a much older student who had a zigzag pattern of bright blue rashes all over her face and arms.Remus tried to eat at a decent pace but pretty much shoved everything into his mouth. He was so hungry! He had barely eaten anything the day before, and he needed to eat a lot more to make up for what he lost during the final phase of the moon, all the energy and weight he had burned off his already frail body.Pomfrey fetched him seconds which he ate every bite of, then a third helping which he only just barely managed to finish. Then she checked him over, pleased all the numbers seemed to be at a good level except his heart rate was a little higher than normal."You won't be going to class until afternoon," she said.Remus started to argue then stopped. He wanted to go to Charms since that wouldn't be for a few hours, then thought it might be better if he did rest. And spend time away from the others... "I missed so many classes already," he finally said, knowing Pomfrey would get suspicious if he didn't protest at all, and might take that as a sign he shouldn't go to the afternoon classes.She reiterated the need for him to rest, and finally Remus gave a meek agreement. After she disappeared into her office he swung his legs out of bed, finding slippers waiting for him by his bedside thankfully. He went to the bathroom and when he returned he found three very concerned Marauders waiting for him."Remus!" Peter said brightly, the first to spot him exiting the bathroom."Oh, thank Merlin!" Sirius's face flooded with relief and he actually ran over, hugging Remus. "I thought—we were worried—you weren't—"Remus was unable to hug back, still extremely confused as to why he was being hugged when they knew what he was. So he just sort of stood there stiffly with Sirius's arms around him. "I haven't left... yet."Sirius's face darkened, James scowled, and Peter pouted at the 'yet'. Remus had to endure hugs from James and Peter too before they let him get back into bed. As soon as he was settled in the others dumped stuff on top of him. There was a giant card and three wrapped presents which were obviously sweets. Remus blinked at this then up at his grinning friends."Read the card!" Peter urged.Remus picked up the card, startled at how heavy it was. On the front were drawings that represented the four of them. A broom for James, camera for Pete, what looked like a paintbrush for Sirius, and in the middle of the three drawings was a book that was entitled 'A History Of Nerds' by Jirius. Remus sniffled, determined not to cry again and it was put to the test as he opened the card, revealing why it was so heavy. Inside were several photographs. Of Remus, with his friends, and written under each one was something really kind. There was one of James giving Remus a piggyback ride, both mugging for the camera, and underneath was 'I'll carry you whenever you need it!'. There was one of Remus and Peter smushed cheek to cheek with big grins as Peter had taken the picture himself, and underneath 'You always make me smile!'. There was one of Sirius and Remus both covered with webbing from when they had been practicing the spiderweb spell at the end of their first year, captioned 'I'll stick with you through thick and thin'. There were twelve photos total, six stuck on each side. He could feel there was something on the back so he flipped it over and saw a very recent picture of the three of them. They were in their pajamas and it was obviously taken either the previous night or that morning. They were all giving double thumbs up except Peter who only gave one thumbs up as his other arm was stretched out to take the photo. We're your friends no matter what! was written underneath.Remus set the card down and bent forward, covering his face as the tears came."Told you he'd cry," James said rather smugly. Then, "Oof!" as Sirius elbowed him.I don't deserve this! he wanted to say. This is all wrong!"Open the presents!" Peter said, bouncing now.Remus lowered his shaky hands to rip the paper off. A packet of cauldron cakes, a bag of frothy fish, and then he gave a tiny gasp at the final prezzie: a mini box of double fudge chocoballs. His favorite. His absolute favorite."You like it all?" James asked.Remus swallowed, trying to force his emotions back. "Y—yes. Thank you. Y-you shouldn't have." You really, really shouldn't have!Sirius sat on the edge of Remus's bed. "We wanted to make it clear that you're our friend," he said firmly, eyes boring into Remus. "Very clear. And we also wanted to apologize for—for hurting you."Remus bowed his head to avoid his eyes, plucking at a bit of the shiny red wrapping paper. "I don't..." But he trailed off as he wasn't entirely sure exactly what he wanted to say. "We c-can't talk too freely here," he finally settled on, eyes darting towards the other patient who was sitting up in her bed, reading, occasionally casting jealous looks at the sweets on Remus's lap."No, no," Sirius agreed, patting Remus's arm. "No intention of doing that!""We'll talk later," said James. "Right?"Remus bit his lip and pulled off little shreds of paper now. "Um. M—maybe..."But before any of them could argue further, someone burst into the hospital wing. "REMUS!"They all jumped, staring as Lily ran across the floor, face quite pale."Oh, God! You are here!" she gasped out, coming to a halt next to his bed. "Spinnet asked me how you were doing and I—I had no idea what he meant and I said I wasn't sure since you were still here and he said no, you came back to the dorms last night but then had to return here in the middle of the night!""Wanna turn the volume down a little, Red?" James demanded. "Pomfrey won't—"It was too late. Pomfrey was coming into the room to find the source of the noise and immediately puffed up like a toad. "Absolutely not!" she said, seeing Remus had four visitors. "He needs his rest! He may have one visitor right now." All four of his friends began protesting at how unfair that was until Pomfrey said, "If you continue arguing then he shall have no visitors!""I'll stay," Sirius said.Remus started a little bit, knowing if Sirius stayed it would mean tiptoeing around the Subject and he didn't want to. "Um, c—could Lily stay?" he asked quietly, trying to ignore how injured Sirius looked. "You and I have a l-lot to t-t-t—talk about and I do need to... not... stress too much right now." He gave Sirius what he hoped was an apologetic enough expression.Sirius frowned but nodded, sliding off his bed. "Yeah, guess so. Will you be coming to Charms?""No he will not," Pomfrey snapped. "Nor will he be likely to be in your afternoon classes unless he rests."After grumbles and harumphes and gentle pats to Remus's shoulders the Marauders left, and Lily pulled one of the visitors' chairs over to the side of Remus's bed, taking a seat. Pomfrey gave her a smile, quite pleased it was her who stayed and not the troublemakers. She shut the curtains around Remus's bed and left them alone."What happened?" Lily asked quietly, reaching over to take Remus's hand.He tried to resist the urge to yank his hand away. He did not like contact right now, it made him feel itchy and miserable and uncomfortable; however it wasn't her fault, she wasn't involved at all in what happened, so he just grit his teeth to bear her fingers around his as he explained he had been let out of the hospital late yesterday afternoon, and he had gone to his dorm to rest until he had some awful nightmares in the middle of the night that sent him into shock. "James, Sirius, and Peter brought me down here, and Madame Pomfrey told me I needed to stay," he finished."Oh, Remus!" She squeezed his hand which physically hurt him, made his skin crawl and his soul wriggle with discomfort. "I'm so sorry. It must have been an awful nightmare to send you in—" She stopped, straightening up a little. "You look thinner.""Um, y-yeah, I lost a few pounds over the weekend when I was here," he mumbled, wanting his hand free so he could go back to tearing up bits of paper."And Pomfrey let you leave?" Her eyes narrowed in suspicion.He gave a helpless shrug. "I was doing better. She thought it would be fine.""Hmph. Well." She tossed one of her short braids over her shoulder and gave him a fierce look. "You better get rest!""I will," he promised with a small smile. "That's sorta why I'd rather you visit right now than them."She gave a small nod, settling back in the chair, finally pulling her hand from his which sent a cool relief through his body. "I'm glad they were able to get you down here though. I heard rumors Filch caught some students out of bed but no major points had been removed from any of the houses."They talked for a bit more, Lily telling him about the lessons he had missed on Monday and Tuesday, promising to bring copies of her notes to him as soon as she could as well as notes from today's Charms class. Shortly after she left so Remus could try to relax, which wasn't the easiest. He kept changing positions, rolling over, plumping his pillow up, kicking the blanket off, pulling the blanket back on.I'm going to talk to them first, he decided eventually, picking up the card they made so he could look at the photos and nice words again. Then I'll tell Dumbledore. Though that thought didn't feel too pleasant, or even solid. It seemed more vague. Something he should do... but... kinda didn't want to. I can't trust them though, they don't...But am I sure I can't trust them? Is it so different from the adults knowing? I don't trust Slughorn, but he knows. Dumbledore trusts him. But Dumbledore would never trust the other Marauders! He's always urging caution...Remus chewed at his fingernails anxiously, trying to sort through the thoughts whizzing around his head.Sirius knew for a while and nothing happened. James knew for a month and nothing happened. Peter knew for a few days and nothing happened... But... that's different from what could happen, maybe they'd let it slip next year, next month, tomorrow!No, no. He had to do the safe thing, the practical thing. Had to tell. Had to leave.But—he didn't want to!He didn't want to leave school! He loved school! And he didn't want to leave his friends.Remus looked at the picture on the back of the card, at their smiles and thumbs up. We're your friends no matter what! It wouldn't be true once they realized—if he managed to explain to them how dangerous...But...Remus groaned and put the card on the bedside table along with the sweets then yanked the blanket over his head, wishing he could take some dreamless sleep potion to escape this for a while!/\/\/\/\/\After Remus ate lunch, Pomfrey did several diagnostic spells again then inquired how he was doing. He didn't know how to answer, since he wasn't sure how he felt. He told her this, so she decided to keep him in the hospital wing for the remainder of the afternoon. He'd be missing his afternoon classes... which he didn't want to do. Missing one class was one thing, but all of them? He had missed too much already, and this time when he argued with her he really meant it.Pomfrey put her foot down. "Absolutely not, you need some more rest. I'm not entirely sure what went on to cause you such distress but I won't allow the risk! You may leave after supper."He glowered as she left, and sulked for a while. The blue-rashed girl spoke up, saying he should be glad for getting a break from classes. He didn't respond as he knew whatever he said would probably be tart. He just mumbled incoherently instead, and took one of the magazines from the table. Witch Weekly. It wasn't too interesting, but it gave him some reading material. Perhaps Pomfrey would lend him something to read because he was now very bored! No, not quite bored; more of he wanted a distraction. He wanted to put off dwelling any more on the situation until after he talked to his friends again, after he tried to make it clear to him how much of a monster he was, why it wasn't safe for him to stay.Five minutes later he put the magazine down and went to Pomfrey's office, knocking at the door. "Can I rest in my dorm?" he asked as soon as the door opened.She pursed her lips. "No, Mr. Lupin! That is what you did yesterday and look what happened. Go back to bed.""Can I at least have a book? I've n-nothing to do, since I d—didn't bring anything with me."Pomfrey disappeared and returned with something for him to read. He went back to his bed, disappearing into the medical tome for a while. Eventually, though, he set it aside since he began to grow jittery and nervous. The rest of the afternoon went on like that until after Transfiguration when Lily showed up again with the promised notes."Can I ask you something?" he asked her after shuffling through the notes, wanting some advice with no idea how to explain without going into the details he couldn't go into. "If—if something... if you had to choose be—between... Um, the—the thing is... I'm—school..." Then he stopped, giving up trying to figure out words.Lily scooted her chair closer. "What's going on?"Remus floundered a bit, knowing of course his strange stammering would make her curious. It had been a mistake to even bring it up. "I'm just... having a lot of—of trouble right now," he finally decided on, tugging at the sleeve of his pajama top. "I think I'm getting worse.""Worse?"He averted his gaze from hers. "I don't know. I—" He paused, then plunged in. "I'm thinking about going home."Lily jerked, startled. "What? You mean... leave Hogwarts?!" He nodded. "But—why? Are you that bad? Aren't you doing all right under Madame Pomfrey's care? I don't understand..." To his surprise her eyes got a little watery. "You're not really considering dropping out, are you? You haven't—what do you mean worse? What about your education? I thought you loved learning!""I d-d-do!" It was both nice yet disconcerting how upset she was over the thought of him leaving, and perhaps he shouldn't have said anything but it felt good to at least talk about it with someone besides the Marauders even if he couldn't explain the circumstances fully. "I haven't... decided...""Is it because you had to come back here so quickly after you got out?" she asked, tilting her head."Um, partly, yeah," he agreed. "I don't want to be—" He stopped quickly, flushing a little pink. He almost said he didn't want to be a burden to his friends! Which he hadn't even considered until it nearly slipped out. It would be a terrible burden on them!"Don't want to be what?" she asked, since he remained silent for several long seconds."I dunno. I'm just—just thinking about... about things," he muttered, plucking at the blanket now. "I don't w-want to leave. Of course I don't. But I'm worried if I stay..."Lily put her hand on his. He hoped spending the afternoon and most the morning alone would make him feel easier with contact but the discomfort shot right back into his body. "I hope you don't go. You seem to be... pretty... good. I know I can only judge on what I see and have no idea how you're doing on the inside. But haven't things been going well for you for the most part? Except last night?""Yes. It's—I know. As I said, I'm not sure. I probably shouldn't have said anything to you but...""I'm glad you did," she said gently. "If you need anything, I'm here for you, okay?"He forced himself to twist his hand around so he could squeeze her hand like she had done for him earlier. "I know. Thank you. I—I'm glad we're friends."Her eyes shone a little then she turned her head away, rather pink herself./\/\/\/\/\The Marauders didn't come in again at all before Pomfrey let Remus leave after supper. He was both relieved and disappointed, hoping they had decided he wasn't safe to be around. But when he walked into the common room he found Peter waiting for him."You're back!" he said cheerfully then grabbed his arm. "Come on! We've got something for you!""Wh—what?" he squeaked as Pete dragged him up the stairs and into the dorm where he found a huge banner stretching across the room. Welcome Back Remy! Well. Not really banner. More like one of their bedsheets painted."You're back!" James exclaimed, just as happily as Peter had a moment ago."Welcome back," Sirius said with a smile.Remus's lips twitched a little then he forced himself to frown. "Why did you do this?"James rolled his eyes, sounding exasperated when he asked, "Why do you think?"Sirius stepped forward. "As I said this morning, we all feel very bad for hurting you and we—""We should put the curtains up before we talk anymore," James pointed out.Sirius pulled a face. "I wasn't gonna say anything like that!"The three of them got down James and Peter's bed curtains, putting them back up over the locked door. Remus had to admit it was an extremely clever way of muffling the door!"Okay." Sirius cleared his throat. "We all feel very bad for hurting you and we wanted to try to show you how much we care about you, and don't care about—about, er...""The You Know What," Peter said with a nod.James bounced over, throwing an arm around Remus. "We spent the afternoon in the library, actually! Reading about... You Know Whats. Reading more, I should say; Siri and I—""Don't call me that," Sirius grumbled."—did some last month but we did some more, with Pete too," James continued, ignoring Sirius. "We thought maybe if you knew we did more research it might make you feel a little better?"Remus's eyes darted from Marauder to Marauder then down at his feet. "I... do appreciate you doing some... looking into it, and I hope that you understand more why I—""Anyway," James cut him off, flapping his hand dismissively, "nothing we found convinced us to change our minds about you. That's what you were gonna say, isn't it? That you hoped we see you as a monster now?"Remus pressed his lips thin, aggravated over how right James was. "No," he lied.James raised his eyebrows, smirking. "Mmhmm"Peter edged closer to Remus's other side. "There was a lot of horrible things in some of the books we read.""Because wer—" Remus hesitated; even though they knew, saying the word so publicly seemed so wrong! "Because we are horrible," he settled on."Don't think that's true," Peter said, lifting his chin. "I may be stupid but I'm not that stupid.""You're not stupid," Remus replied automatically. "Er—except in this case! In this case you're all stupid.""Fine!" Sirius snapped which caused everyone to jump. "We're stupid. Happy now? Doesn't make our feelings towards you any less, does it?" Remus whimpered a little, completely not expecting that response. He tried to say something but Sirius just continued talking. "Can't you accept the fact that knowing you're a werewolf doesn't change—er, doesn't make us dislike you in any way? I was going to say it doesn't change our feelings for you but that's not true cause ever since I found out I've definitely felt more worried and concerned.""It should change though!" Remus argued, face heating up, hands curling into fists. "You should hate me! Th-that's the—the point!"Sirius folded his arms. "No."Remus reeled back, eyebrows raising. "You—I—the—what?""I said no I shouldn't hate you. And I don't. I won't." He crossed the space between them, hands on Remus's shoulders. "What's so bad about us caring about you?"Remus stared into his face for a few seconds then ripped away with him. Anger was bubbling up inside of him, and it spilled over. "D'you know what I was doing Saturday night?" he asked, words sharp with fury. "I was slashing apart my own body! I woke up soaked in blood with my own flesh scattered across the room, unable to walk because I didn't have a person around to kill! I want to kill so bad that I destroy myself, that's how violent it is!"He wanted so bad to pull those words back. He had flung them out without even thinking, confessed to the dirty, shameful things that happened. Told them exactly what he hated anyone knowing! He put his hand to his mouth, beginning to shake again, wanting to beg them to just forget what he said."Oh, Remus," James said, and hugged him tightly."Is that true?" Peter asked.Remus couldn't bear to look at him, look at any of them. "Yes.""Oh." Peter thought about this for a second then put his arms around Remus too."I stand by what I said last night," Sirius said. "What you do as a wolf doesn't make you a monster. And—even if you see yourself like that, can't you get that we don't?"No. He couldn't. How could he? Because he was! He'd known as long as he could remember that's what he was. Monster. Beast. Vicious creature. Should be locked away. Didn't deserve any human rights. Didn't deserve this. This... acceptance. And love. He couldn't wrap his head around it in any way, shape, or form.But... did he have to accept their acceptance? Rather, could he live with their acceptance? Regardless of understanding it or not, could he go through each day knowing they didn't feel any less about him for what he was? Not—not that he would be! Because he wouldn't be here at Hogwarts, he'd be long gone...Right?Remus wriggled then pulled loose because their touch was too overwhelming, and he went over to sit on the edge of his bed, head in hands (though thankfully not crying this time)."Remy..."He lifted his chin to see Sirius kneeling in front of him."Do you really want to leave?"Remus turned away, suspecting that if he tried to answer he'd just have another breakdown."What if you stay a few more days?" James asked, as he and Pete came over. "Put off making the decision."He considered that. Waiting, perhaps, until the weekend to make a decision. That would just be two days. Two days of... trying to get through school with them knowing... and them still wanting to be friends despite knowing...Two days.He had agreed to one night, which he did... and survived... but two days?Could he... do it?He wanted to. Wanted to stay. The desire to remain at Hogwarts despite the danger took over and he slowly nodded. "A-a—all r-right," he replied quietly, knowing how perilously idiotic it was of him to do so.The other Marauders gave whoops of joy then hugged him tightly. Remus bore their hugs without complaint, though was very glad when they let go."C—can I be alone though right now? I p-promise I'm not going to run off," he added when they all frowned. "I just... really... need to... be alone.""But you were alone all day," Peter said, and James smacked him. "Ouch!""Yeah, if you promise not to leave?" Sirius inquired."I promise."Sirius reached out to ruffle his hair then stopped, for some reason. "Okay. C'mon guys."Peter grabbed his bag of photography stuff since he had a club meeting soon then the three of them left. Remus let a long breath as soon as the door shut then flopped backwards, hands pressing against his face again.He grabbed Gwyllgi and a blanket, dragging them down into the safe den of under his bed. I guess making absolutely stupid choices is a Marauders' trait after all, he thought, clutching his stuffed dog.But... he didn't want to leave!

Author's note: I've gotten several questions regarding the pronunciation of Gwyllgi. From what I understand and can tell, it is pronounced Gwishgi. Both the Gs are the Guh type, hard like the G in "good" or "girl". And the Gi at the end rhymes with "Key". G-wish-gi. The I in Wish doesn't seem very pronounced? So maybe more like G-wsh-gi. I really hope I got that right and if I happen to have any Welsh-speaking readers PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong. Okay so I've had some feedback from some Welsh speakers and am informed it's not quite a 'sh' sound but a mix between 'sh' and 'th'. Kind of a hissing? And another said it's closer to just an S./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus's evening went quite weird for him. He spent most his time under his bed, then moved to be on top of his bed mostly so Spinnet and Struthers wouldn't judge him (plus on the off chance he fell asleep and had a nightmare...). The other Marauders left him alone although he could tell they wanted to talk; they kept giving him looks and once or twice Peter said Remus's name then mumbled 'never mind'. James stole a big piece of chocolate cake from the kitchens, giving it to Remus before retreating to his own bed.Other thank thanking Struthers for his help during the night, Remus remained silent. He closed his curtains, working intently on homework as best he could while trying to ignore the buzzing inside of him. He was so on edge still, his skin feeling strange like he was falling from a great height—all prickly and sensitive.At one point Remus wrote a letter to his parents, confessing that he had lied to them, telling them that his friends now knew—then he tore the parchment to shreds and since he didn't really have any better way to get rid of it without going to the bathroom he just shoved the paper in his mouth and swallowed.Then just before he went to sleep he jerked upright with the horrifying realization that keeping this a secret was impossible."Balls!" he hissed out, throwing his blanket back, intending to wake up his friends to talk to them. He hesitated. Should he? Did it matter? He couldn't stay no matter what... he had fooled himself even considering the possibility of staying, of keeping all of this a secret... there was zero chance. He thought about it another few seconds then jammed his feet in his slippers, tiptoeing over to wake Sirius up."We need to talk," he said. "Privately. All four of us.""I thought you didn't want—" Sirius started to say then stopped, nodding. "All right."They got James and Peter then left the Gryffindor tower completely, using James's cloak to hide them as they headed to a nearby secret passage for the utmost privacy. They sat down, knees bumping together since the passage wasn't very wide, all of them lighting up their wands so they weren't in darkness.Remus plucked at his pajama top, trying to figure out the best way to say this. "I—I... I c-c-can't stay.""What!?" they all cried out."You said you'd give it a few days!" James said, annoyed.Remus cringed back, holding up a shaky hand. "I know b-b-but—but I forgot something very important, and—and it means I c-can't keep the fact you know about me a secret.""What, you have to tell your parents?" Sirius asked, folding his arms."Why can't you keep it secret?" added Peter.Remus slumped back, feeling quite ill. "I—the thing is, I... there is s-s-someone involved in all this that... c-can... see my memories... and will."All three of them stared at him in disbelief. Remus ducked his head, feeling like complete crap. He'd have to tell them everything including the fact that all their little Marauder-y secrets were known to someone else. Guilt tore through him and he wanted to cry. He had been in such disbelief over the past thirty-two-ish hours he had simply forgotten."A Legilimens?" Sirius asked.Remus's head whipped 'round. "What? How—how d-did you know? Are you one?"Sirius gave him a wry smile. "No, but I know about them. One of my uncles knows Legilimency, and one of my cousins is a natural Occlumens."James lifted his hands, putting them into a T position. "Time out. A what and a what?""Yeah, you both completely lost me," Peter sighed."Legilimency is—" Remus started at the same time Sirius said, "An Occlumens—" then they both stopped and looked at each other."Legilimency is the magic used to—to look into someone's thoughts and memories," Remus explained when Sirius remained silent. "Occlumency is the magic to stop it." He rubbed at his temple. "L-last year Professor D—Dumbledore suggest I begin training in Occlumency. Th—that's what I do Tuesday evenings. I don't see Pomfrey, I'm training in Occlumency. And my teacher, she—she looks through my memories. I c-can't hide anything from her. She'll see, she'll know you know, and—and that's it. I was so stressed out about everything I just never even thought about it until now."They just continued staring at him for a moment, processing this information."Is there any chance of her... keeping this a secret?" James asked slowly, adjusting his glasses.Remus shook his head. "No. She's k-kept the fact I have friends a secret though has made it abundantly clear she disapproves of how close we are—""What do you mean having friends is a secret?" Peter asked.He pressed his hands against his face. This was turning into such a rabbit hole! "I'm not s'posed to have friends," he mumbled."What?!""Okay, wow, is—is there anything else you're keeping from us?" James asked."I'm sorry!" he moaned. "How was I to tell you about this? You d-didn't know the other part and—and they're tied together. Me being a... a-a you know, and me not supposed to have friends!""Is that why you kept pushing us away last year?" Sirius asked with absolute clarity.He nodded miserably. "Y-y-yes. After my parents decided I c-c-could come to Hogwarts they spent every day telling me I c-can't have friends. They're always reminding me in letters. I t-t-tried to obey them, tried not to—to be friends with you but—but I really... wanted friends. They t-told if I ever made friends that my friends would f-figure it out, and they were right."The others were silent, absorbing this information, all of them looking upset. Then finally Peter was the first one to say anything. "If it helps technically only Sirius figured it out. I never would have.""Yeah, I'm not sure if I would have either," James added helpfully."You're not allowed to have friends," Sirius said blankly."No," he whispered, going back to tugging at the hem of his shirt.Sirius swore loudly then got up, stalking back and forth, fury radiating off his body. Finally he stormed a little ways down the hall, muttering and kicking the wall."That's bollocks!" James growled then his eyes got wide. "Wait, is that why you didn't come to my party? But I sent your parents an invitation too! How—how did they not know you have friends?"Remus looked up at him. "I... I told them you probably sent the invitations out to everyone in our dorm. I told them I had n-n-no idea why you'd invite me otherwise. S-same for after the Easter holidays, when you tried t-t-talking to my mother on the platform. Somehow I c-convinced my parents you were just the sort of kid who assumes everyone is their friend even if they're not."James frowned, looking a little disappointed at this information. Remus wanted to apologize, but it was such an awful thing he didn't know how to begin. How do you apologize to someone for telling your parents they were a total narcissist?"I had t-t-to tell them s-something..."James smiled. "I know, I get it. I'm not mad. Just saying, you're a good liar.""So your parents let you come here but expected you to never make friends?" Peter asked, turning the subject back to what it was, and he sounded very frustrated."Yeah...""But why?!"Remus rolled his eyes. "Because as I said they thought if I made friends then those friends would figure out my secret! Look, none of this m-matters! The point is Miss Fawley is g-going to see that you know, and she won't let this slide. And—and Professor Dumbledore is probably going to erase my secret from your memory," he added, because he couldn't bear the thought of them having it sprung on them. Not that it really mattered as all of this would be taken out of their heads too."When I asked if you were keeping anything else from us, I think that would qualify," James groaned, head dropping into his hands."Erase our memories?" Peter squeaked."He's not erasing anything," Sirius snapped, entire body tense. He stormed back, smelling even more furious somehow. This really struck him harder than it did the other two. "He tries I'm gonna break his wand.""He defeated Grindelwald, the most powerful dark wizard, you can't just break his wand," James said."I don't give a flying jarvey who he defeated, I am breaking his wand if he tries to erase anything in my head!" Sirius snarled. His eyes then flickered to Remus who shrank back. "So basically this Fawley lady is gonna see that we know, tell Dumbles, and Dumbles will mess up my brain?""Um—""Fawley can't know then," he went on, ignoring Remus."I c-c-can't hide it from her!" Remus squeaked. "I'm barely able to resist her legilimency at all! I—I'm starting to, but it's hardly—and I'm sorry, I w-wish I c-c-could but I can't!" His nose itched as he felt on the verge of more tears, finally not for himself but for Sirius who was extremely distressed and upset."You said she knows we're friends," James said quickly, leaning forward. "Maybe she can be convinced to keep this a secret too?""I—" Remus chewed at his nails nervously. "I doubt it. As I said, she's never approved of how close we are and she—" He stopped, not wanting to tell Sirius the truth. "She wouldn't keep it to herself. It's too dangerous.""Maybe... we can convince her?" Sirius asked, running his fingers through his hair. "Go with you to your next lesson. Tell her we know. Maybe—maybe she can teach us Occlumency too, to help protect you even more.""Yes!" James agreed, snapping his fingers. "I mean, I'd be willing to learn if it meant helping keep you safe.""Same here," Pete said, nodding vigorously. "And then she'll see how serious we are about making sure we keep your secret.""She—wouldn't agree," Remus finally managed to wheeze out, very taken aback that they once again took the matter at hand and went off into a completely different direction! Who heard about all this then went, okay I'm going to learn this difficult and advanced magic too? "She wouldn't.""We can try," Sirius said, reaching over to grab Remus's hand. "What harm can it do? Either way she'll know we know." Then, as if realizing what he was doing, he released Remus's hand, going a little pink in the dim light.Remus did not want to tell Sirius exactly why this was a bad idea however it seemed as though he needed to. "Sirius... I d-d-didn't w-want to say anything but—but..." He took in a deep breath and pushed his hair back, fingers twitching a little. "Miss F-Fawley... does not l-like you."Sirius blinked then sat back, tilting his head to one side. James and Peter exchanged curious looks. "Me? Specifically me?" he asked and Remus nodded. "Why?"He looked down at his lap now. He didn't want to tell him who exactly she was in relation to him. He had told too much before, and Sirius didn't know who the werewolf's sister was... and didn't think he should be the one to say. "That's her st—story, not mine. I—she just... really hates the Blacks. She's d-disapproved of you especially since the—the beginning of our friendship and has urged me not to—t-to get close...""That's just how it goes, isn't it?" Sirius hissed out after a few seconds. "You couldn't throw a stick into a group of magical folk without hitting someone who hates us.""You could right now," Peter said and Sirius looked confused. "Cause then the stick would hit one of us and none of us hate you. Is three considered a group?""It... could be," Remus said thoughtfully. "Depending on how you look at it you could potentially call two people a group?" Then he realized he was pondering over something so trivial when there were more important matters at hand and ducked his head, feeling dumb. "Er. In any case, I—I doubt Miss Fawley will take too k-kindly to you being there.""Too bad," Sirius said, tossing his hair back. "She's gonna find out no matter what so I want to be there to argue my case. Tuesday night, you said?""Y—yes," Remus whispered rather helplessly."That gives us plenty of time to work out a good argument," he said with a nod. "Remus, since you know her you can help figure out the best way to approach her. To convince her."Remus remembered telling her Sirius wasn't a dark wizard at all, and her flat out saying 'he will be'. "It won't work.""We can try," James said, patting Sirius's arm though he was looking at Remus. "What do we have to lose?"Remus felt like there should be an answer to that, but he didn't know what. He didn't foresee this outcome of explaining his Occlumency lessons to them at all! He should probably try to talk them out of it but it was late, he was still beyond exhausted, and all he wanted was some sleep, which the others readily agreed to. They returned to their dorm where Remus curled up in his bed with Gwyllgi once more, noticing only just before he fell asleep that he had gone from promising to stay only a couple more days to essentially promising to stay until at least Tuesday./\/\/\/\/\It felt super weird to wake up and get ready for classes. It had been nearly an entire week since his last class! Plus this would be the first time being in public knowing that they knew. It wasn't until halfway through breakfast that he realized that he sorta expected them to act differently, which they didn't. All three of them acted perfectly normal. James and Sirius were rowdy, Peter egged them on, and none of them treated Remus at all different than they did the week before.He didn't know how to take that.Actually, panic started bubbling up inside of him and he wanted to run. They know. His stomach twisted and he was on the verge of at least going to the loo to vomit when Lily appeared, suddenly hugging Remus, saying how happy she was that he was looking better. She glanced at the Marauders then took Remus's hand, tugging him away from the table; they both went rather red as James and Sirius hooted and snickered at her holding his hand. What they'd normally do. It kinda made him a bit dizzy."Sorry," she said once they were away from the tables. They were still in the Great Hall but in a corner, so they could whisper without anyone really overhearing. "I was just curious over whether you made a decision."For a second Remus had no clue what she meant. Decision about what? Then it dawned on him. "Oh. N—no. I'm going to see how the next few days go and then, er, go from there."Lily gave him another hug. "Okay. If you need to talk about anything I'm here for you and—and just know that I'll really miss you if you leave."Remus actually hugged her back. He still didn't appreciate contact at the moment but he could force himself to do this. "I'd miss you too," he admitted.They returned to their seats, both ignoring all their friends amusement over them hugging so much. Remus could tell Inkwood and Colgate were both giggling furiously while Lily kept her head up, pointedly ignoring them."Have a nice chat with your girrrllfrrrieeend?" James teased, prodding Remus as he sat back down."She's n-n-not my girlfriend!" he snapped. "She was only c-concerned since I had been in the hospital again."That put a blanket over them, and their ribaldry stopped, James even offering a sheepish apology.In Herbology Sprout paired everyone off by taking names out of a bag and Remus ended up with Bones which wasn't too bad. At least they knew each other. Bones was a chatterbox but never seemed to mind that Remus was quiet, so he yammered on as they worked while Remus nodded and gave 'uh-huh's and 'yeah's at the right times, constantly wiping his sweaty palms off on his trousers, feeling the tingling in his spine that was urging him to get away because Merlin the Marauders knew! Even if they were okay about it, they knew, they knew, they—"I'm glad you're doing better," Bones said out of no where. Remus glanced up at him, breathing a little heavily, glad that Bones didn't seem to notice he was beginning to freak out (if he had, Remus knew it would have destroyed any chance of pretending to be okay). "Evans was real worried about you last night in study group, and you've missed three of them. Oh, here." He pulled a card out of his bag, shoving it into Remus's hand.Remus was very surprised, and quite touched. "Th-th-thank you.""Kyra made it too," Bones said, nodding over towards Pierce. "It's from both of us."He made sure to thank Pierce too, after class, then opened up the card as the Gryffindors headed back to their tower for some showers. It was a fairly simple get well card, but it meant a lot to Remus.At least the shower gave him some time to focus. He sat on the floor, hugging his knees as dirty water trickled down his body. He rocked back and forth, chewing at his bottom lip. You can do this, you promised to do this, they're your friends, for some bizarre reason they still want to be friends.He cried a little bit, feeling terrified, feeling anger, feeling—feeling far too much for him to ever be able to handle. He then pressed his hand tight against his mouth and gave a muffled scream, quieted further by the sound of the shower. It helped, a little. With that he managed to calm himself down and finished washing off./\/\/\/\/\At lunch Silverlocke sought him out to tell him how glad he was Remus was doing better, and said he had gone by the hospital wing the previous evening but Remus had already left. He had a get well card for him too. Then Buckling said she was glad he was doing better when they happened to pass each other after he left the Great Hall. He felt very overwhelmed by so many people expressing concern over him. When he mentioned this, James threw an arm around him and asked what was so strange."You're a great guy," he said cheerfully. "Course people are gonna care."He had no idea what to say to that or what to do with James's arm. He wasn't... when Lily hugged him earlier it only felt a little bad, but James's arm felt horrible and he knew it was because James knew, and it was so strange that James knew and was just touching him like that. It bothered him physically, and mentally. James didn't seem to notice, thankfully, but did pull his arm away to smack at Sirius's arm.Remus slowly let out a shaky breath. This was so much harder than he expected. He felt so on edge and the feeling of dread and terror hadn't diminished at all. Even with them acting normal, every time they spoke he inwardly flinched as if expecting them to say something that had to do with his curse though they never did.Just a few more days, he reminded himself, resisting the urge to scratch at his own arms to try to get rid of the edginess. But thinking about how little time he had left at school certainly didn't help either, and he just felt absolutely miserable on top of everything else./\/\/\/\/\Defense Against the Dark Arts was pretty tiring; Prewett had a lot of spells he wanted everyone to practice, setting them up with training dummies. Remus considered staying after class to talk to Prewett a little bit about what he should do if he thought anyone knew his secret, try to make it seem hypothetical—but he didn't want to risk Prewett figuring it out. Fawley would discover the truth in a couple days anyway, and that'd be that.Prewett, however, wanted to talk to Remus. He kept him after dismissing everyone else then motioned for him to sit down. He was a little concerned over hearing about Remus needing to be in the hospital wing. He didn't know the details and didn't ask about the details, merely inquired about his health. Remus muttered that he had had a very rough moon and then went into shock 'or something' shortly after his return."I apologize if my questions were intrusive," Prewett said once Remus finished. "It was my understanding that one of a lycanthrope's abilities includes rapid healing.""It d-does," Remus said, still mumbling. "But it d-d-doesn't prevent incidents from happening.""No," Prewett agreed. "I'm glad you're all right. I also wanted to ask you if you wanted to postpone your next exam?" Remus frowned, trying to remember when it was. "This Saturday," Prewett added, noticing his confusion.Remus wanted to smack himself. "I c-c-completely forgot. Um—w-well, I, er..." He really wanted to take the exam and find out the results; if he took the test Saturday he probably could. Putting it off meant not taking it, since he'd be gone after Tuesday night. But he wasn't sure if he was really in the headspace to take an exam. "P—perhaps it would be best to, erm, postpone it.""Very well." Prewett pulled out a little green notebook, flipping it open. "Would next Saturday work for you? The fourth? I'm slated to take care of some morning detention—your friend Mr. Black, actually—but we could have the exam in the afternoon."Remus nodded. "That would work. Th-th-thank you, Professor..." He hesitated then stood up. "And th-thank you for everything you've d-done for me, I truly appreciate it."Prewett's blue eyes went big. He started to say something then closed his mouth. "I was going to say it's nothing, but considering your previous Defense teacher I know it's not nothing to you. You're more than welcome, Mr. Lupin; every student deserves an education, especially one with a brain as remarkable as yours. It'd be such a shame to waste it by letting the despairing grades you were given last year to go unchecked. My brother and I got top marks in this class when we were at school but your ability surpasses ours when we were your age."Remus's breath hitched a little in surprise. "R... really?""Oh yes. You obviously have a natural affinity towards this sort of curriculum. You're quite the prodigy! It's very impressive. You'd—" He then stopped, actually turning quite red. "You'd do very well in this field," he said and Remus knew that wasn't what he initially intended to say.Remus burned with curiosity as to what Prewett really wanted to say however he didn't want to push. He wondered if Prewett had nearly said Remus would do well in the Ministry as an Auror or something like it. "Th—thank you so much, Professor. That m-m-means a lot."Prewett smiled. "Anytime, Mr. Lupin."Remus left the classroom a little dizzy, going over what Prewett had said. It'd be such a shame to waste it. He knew perfectly well he wouldn't be able to do much once he graduated Hogwarts... Quite the prodigy...Suddenly he saw something strange in his head: a great scale. On one side, dipping low, was Dedenne and her hateful words. But then Prewett was on the other side and everything he said was starting to tip the scale in his direction. Remus didn't know Prewett well but he rather liked him; he not only seemed kind but gave off the sort of aura of compassion that not too many people had.Remus would always have Dedenne's filth etched into his head but—but that didn't mean someone else's kindness couldn't be etched over it.And not just Prewett. He glanced side to side at his friends who of course had waited for him. James and Peter were poking each other with their wands while Sirius carried all four school bags, having taken Remus's from his shoulder as soon as he came out. Their response to finding out he was a vicious monster wasn't horror or disgust... how come he could accept that from Prewett, or McGonagall? But not them? Because of their ages? Was that... wrong?"C'mon, Remy!" Sirius said when he noticed Remus flagging behind."C—coming!" He hurried to catch up, a decision cementing inside of him. He wanted to continue his education. And even though it terrified him that they knew and wasn't even sure if he would ever be okay with them knowing, he did not want to leave his friends.He'd do whatever it took to convince Fawley to keep this a secret.He doubted it would work...But he wanted to try.

Author's note: Hey guys so for a while I've been waffling on making this decision but this morning a reader happened to reach out to me about this very issue and I realized I need to do this. I've been under a lot of stress lately and my mental health isn't doing so great, so I've decided to cut back on chapters for the time being. I will be getting chapters out on Tuesdays and Fridays only. I've been falling behind in a lot of stuff irl and need to cut back on some things. I've actually quit the fanfic competition I was in because of this, but it wasn't quite enough. I feel bad doing this but I know if I don't do something my writing is going to really suffer for it, and I don't want that to happen. As I said, this is temporary for a few weeks while I catch up on things irl and get a bit more rest. I really appreciate all the support, and am looking forward to when I can return to my three-a-week schedule!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus kept expecting his friends to bring up the werewolf thing, to ask him questions, to say something; but all day Thursday they just acted normal. Throughout James's practice in the evening he, Sirius, and Peter sat in the bleachers playing a card game while they watched James. Remus prepared himself for whispered questions which never came. Spinnet and Struthers were already in the dorm by the time they returned, and Remus studied for a while before going to bed for a nap before Astronomy. He tossed and turned a lot, wondering why they weren't saying anything. Surely they had questions. Or were they that determined to pretend like everything was the same as before? He wasn't sure which was worse and by the time they went to Astronomy he decided he'd rather they talk to him. Having no idea what they were even thinking made him feel a little uncomfortable.Remus barely got any sleep that night. He finally went down to the common room to sit in a window and press his face against the cool glass, looking up at the gibbous moon. He had always wished he had someone his own age to talk to about werewolf things. But what would they say if he asked them questions? He could picture their puzzled faces if he tried asking 'do normal humans feel like this?', 'do normal humans do that?'."Remy?"It was Sirius. Of course it was."You okay?"Remus kept his forehead against the window. "I dunno," he replied honestly. "It's still... a lot."Sirius stopped at the bottom of the steps. He was wearing his black silk pajamas and cashmere robe which hung open. Remus wished he could own soft clothing like that. It looked so comfy..."Want to be alone?"Remus considered this then shook his head so Sirius came over, sitting on the window seat as well. He looked up at the moon then back down at Remus."I am sorry for hurting you."Remus hunched a little. "You d-didn't mean to," he whispered. "I know that.""Doesn't change the fact I should apologize. I never expected you to react like you did. I was stupid, I wasn't thinking.""What else is new?" Remus asked with a slight smile. Sirius grinned back. "Out of curiosity how did you expect me to act?"Sirius leaned back, tilting his head so he was looking at the curtain rod above them. "I don't know. Upset but not that upset. I figured you'd... take it in stride. You'd deny it but not... like that. Looking back that's really dumb of me.""I always thought if anyone tried to accuse me I could just... well, take it in stride. Laugh it off." He sighed heavily. "I don't really know why I snapped so badly.""I'm just glad you're okay," Sirius said, nudging Remus's foot with his own. "You scared me.""When I snapped?" Remus asked and Sirius nodded."Yeah, it reminded me a lot of that one night you disappeared, at the end of our first year. When you left detention with the bloody nose and looked so..." Sirius trailed off for a second then continued. "You looked like you weren't there.""I wasn't," he admitted. "I wasn't really much there Tuesday night either. Is... that why you asked me to come back?" Remus asked and Sirius made a confused sort of noise. "At one point you had a hold of me and told me to come back.""Oh. Yeah. I was scared you'd really slip away like you had that one night, and I didn't want that to happen."Remus debated telling Sirius the truth about Dedenne and her hatred towards him then decided it'd be better to tell everyone together. "If you guys have any... any questions or—or anything like that, maybe we can talk tomorrow after I'm done with study group."Sirius looked a little excited at that. "Really? You—you'd be okay?""Yeah, I—I kinda figured you'd be asking me stuff today...""We wanted to, but figured it'd be better to wait until you were ready," Sirius explained.Remus warmed at that thought, wondering how he could have possibly gotten so lucky to have friends like them. "I still don't understand why you guys still care about me," he said as he swung his legs around to stand up."And I don't understand why we shouldn't," Sirius replied tartly, getting up as well. They exchanged smiles then headed back up to their dorm, Remus finally able to get to sleep after that./\/\/\/\/\Dear Remus,As I was unable to see you last Tuesday I didn't get the chance to ask you about if we should have a change of plans for this upcoming Tuesday. Tuesday is Halloween and since there will be the feast I was wondering if you'd like to change the date of our meeting. Please let me know if you'd prefer Monday, Wednesday, or another day entirely; I would suggest skipping it entirely but as you missed this last one I am not sure how you would feel about that.Please write back as soon as possible.M. FawleyRemus stared at the letter he received Friday morning, reading and rereading it. He hadn't even thought about the fact Halloween was on a Tuesday! Normally he would just ask to see her sooner but... if he scheduled it for Wednesday then he could attend the feast which would be great. He was about to write back then remembered he wouldn't be going to the lesson alone. So he showed the letter to his three friends, asking them what they thought. They agreed Wednesday was fine if he didn't mind missing study group and if Peter didn't mind missing Photography Club; neither of them did so Remus wrote back saying Wednesday would be fine, then asked James to attach the letter to Fawley's owl for him. James gave him a curious look but did so. Remus promised to explain that later.The Marauders went into Potions class and as they passed the table where Snape sat he hissed out, "How unfortunate you've returned, I rather hoped you had been taken to Saint Mungo's!"Sirius reached for his wand while James grabbed his arm to prevent him from attacking Snape right in front of Slughorn. Snape smirked at this then went back to his conversation with Wicket. Sirius remained agitated for the rest of class, muttering about getting revenge as they left until James cleared his throat reminding him they had much more important things to do than think about revenge. Sirius glanced at Remus then nodded in agreement.After Charms came and went they decided to get food from the kitchens and hide out in a secret passage somewhere, since the period right after lunch was free; it would give them time to talk about things without having Remus miss another study group. They chose the Pit Passage, creeping past the first pit to settle down on the stone floor, their food spread out in front of them, hearing the Babbling Brew bubbling away across the next pit.Remus hadn't eaten much breakfast and had been hungry but knowing what was about to happen made his appetite fade. He just nibbled on an apple, waiting.James was the first one to give in to the silence. "Are you sure it's okay for us to talk about it?"Remus slowly nodded. "Y-yeah," he mumbled. Besides, I'll be gone on Wednesday night anyway. They remained quiet. His skin began to feel itchy and scrape-y as he waited, wanting to yell at them to get it over with.James was again the one to speak up. "What's it like? When you're..." He began nodding strangely with his head to indicate what he meant without saying it."When I'm... ahh... d—during the full moon?" Remus asked and James nodded properly. "Um." He drew his knees up to his chest, wrapping his arms around his legs, not even wanting the apple anymore. "I d-don't know. I have no memory of when I'm a—a—a w-wolf." He swallowed heavily, fingers gripping each other as he felt himself get shaky. Merlin, one question in and he wanted to vomit. Would he be able to get through this without flipping out again? "It doesn't... I don't remember, except for the vague feelings of anger and—and wanting to hurt.""Is it different when you're away from your mother?" Peter asked.Remus was thoroughly confused about that. "Um. I'm n-not sure what you mean by that?""Well, when you're at home aren't you with your mother? During the full moon?"Remus recoiled. "What?! No! I'd—I'd hurt her!"Peter blinked a few times, scratching his head. "I guess I just thought since your mom is one too you'd be with her."Remus was taken aback by this comment. "My—? My mother isn't a werewolf. Why would...? Oh! No, she—she's not sick at all, that was j-just another lie to try to hide the truth," he explained. "I d-didn't want everyone thinking I got sick once a month so—so I used my mother as an excuse too. She's perfectly healthy. No, I was... I was bit.""I knew you were lying about your mother," Sirius said a tad bit triumphantly. Then he frowned. "You were bitten? When? How long have you been a werewolf?""Um. Eight years e—exactly, last week," Remus whispered, rocking a little bit.James dropped his sandwich. "You were four?" he gasped out. Remus nodded. "Merlin's beard...""What happened?" Sirius asked, breathing a bit heavily, smelling as upset as he had in Potions when Snape insulted Remus. "How did it happen?"Remus shrugged. "I don't remember. M—my parents have never t-t-talked about that night. I don—don't know.""When you were four," Sirius muttered angrily. "Four.""How did you survive?" Peter asked, in slight awe."As I s—said I don't remember that night at all. I have no knowledge of—of how I was bitten or why I w-was even outside during a f-full moon..." He had wondered this a lot during his recent life. What exactly had happened? He couldn't imagine his parents letting their four year old run around outside in the dark in the autumn; the middle of summer perhaps, but surely not the end of October! And how had the werewolf even get to him? Were his parents not paying attention?Sirius was suddenly looking him up and down. "Where were you bitten? Did it not leave a mark?"Remus straightened up, stomach swooping in great circles. This was one question he hadn't anticipated although in hindsight he probably should have. "My—my arm," he forced out. "Th-that's why I never wear sh—short-sleeved shirts.""Like when I gave you that J shirt for my tryouts and you wore the long-sleeved top underneath?" James asked."Yeah." He reached up, touching the spot. "It's... really bad." He chopped his right hand along his left elbow. "If the sleeves come here I can wear them but any shorter and—and you can start to see it.""But you don't have any other scars or anything?" Pete asked. "Cause, um, you said the other night that—that you, um, er, t-tore yourself... up?"Remus winced, scooting back a little bit. "I did. I do. But werewolves have regeneration. Healing," he added since they all frowned at the word. "I c-can heal from almost anything, as f-far as I know. If it's d-dark magic then it heals slower. Since my—my own c—c-claws—" he had to wheeze that word out, having difficulty doing so, "—are d-d-dark then it takes t-time to heal up after the, um, the moon. But if... say I cut my hand on a knife then it would heal almost immediately. And none of it leaves scars. Thankfully.""That'd be difficult, being covered in scars from a young age," Peter said.Remus managed a small smile. "Most certainly. With as much as the Ministry hates werewolves, if we were to scar ourselves up every full moon I imagine they'd probably try to pass a law saying if someone has so many visible scars then they had to do testing to see if they were a werewolf or something. Even if there wasn't then anyone with scratch-like scars would be looked down on. It'd be next to impossible to hide ourselves without a lot of glamor spells anytime we went out in public." He rubbed his cheek, trying to imagine how much harder his life would be. He probably wouldn't have even be able to come to school, it'd just be too much of a giveaway!Peter's mouth was very round while James and Sirius were nodding. "It's good you don't get scarred up then," Sirius said."I mean, without—" He paused, sucking in some air. Dare he? "Without healing I'd probably just be dead, with as much as I—I hurt myself during the full moon."Now they looked horrified, probably not realizing just how violent Remus got as a wolf."Is it that bad?" James asked."It can be," Remus said, resting his chin on his knees. He thought about how destroyed his arm was on Sunday morning, then thought back to his first year when he gouged his own eyeballs out and was blinded for a couple days. He thought about all the times he just lay in his own drying blood, in too much pain to move. "I t-told you before I... hurt myself... badly."Sirius started to say something but James spoke first. "So if it's not dark magic you heal up super fast?" Remus nodded. "So—last year when you were knocked out by the bat in the first years' game and fell to the ground you were healed up quick?"Now he smiled again. "Yes. I had to p-pretend to be unconscious while Pomfrey took me back to the hospital wing. She—she never used anything on me to heal.""Is there anything else that you can do because of being a werewolf?" Sirius asked, wanting to know, speaking up before James could talk again.Remus mulled over the question, not quite sure what Sirius meant at first. "Oh," he finally said, getting it. "Yeah. My hearing is very sensitive. And my sense of smell is really intense."James asked, "How sensitive is your hearing?""Really sensitive," he muttered. "It pretty much hurts almost anytime I'm in the Great Hall, or the common room."Peter suddenly looked really worried. "Do... we hurt you?""Yeah, s—sometimes," he admitted. "It's okay!" he added quickly seeing their expressions. "I'm used to it. It hurt a lot when we came back in September, since I wasn't used to all the sounds. It's not so bad now."Sirius cocked his head to one side a bit. "Does talking like this hurt you?""Um, not really," Remus said. "It's a little loud but not painfully loud. I'm used to it. Please don't worry about whether you need to talk softer or anything, it's really fine.""Did us cheering at James's tryouts hurt you?" Pete asked.Remus gave a whiny sort of grunt. "It's fine," he grumbled, tugging at the end of his robes sleeve. "Please don't think too much on it. I'm used to the everyday sounds as well as your voices. It's the really loud stuff that bothers me, like when the Great Hall or common room is especially loud." He didn't want to confess in front of James how worried he was about the upcoming Quidditch game. Then remembered he wouldn't be there.Then, since they were thinking of other questions and Remus remembered what happened at breakfast, he said, "By the way, earlier when—when I asked you to put the letter on the owl for me...?" he glanced at James who nodded, "That was because of—of what I am too. Owls... well, most animals don't really like me. You've seen what it's like when I go into the owlery.""Whoa, that's because you're a—you know?" Peter asked."Uh-huh." He shifted his weight around, trying to find a more comfortable position. "Arthur's always liked me, but generally animals don't.""Rocky seems to love you," James said.Remus snorted. "Yeah, it surprised me. I was a bit scared when I first met him but... for some reason... he doesn't mind me at all."They asked a few more simple questions. Did he have special eyesight too? No. Did it hurt to turn into the wolf? Very much so, and transforming back. Did he crave meat? He wasn't really sure if he craved it, but he did prefer meat especially steak. Where did he go during the moon? Not telling. If he healed up did that mean he didn't get sick? Remus admitted he couldn't remember ever being sick-sick though he did get stomachaches from stress and anxiety, and also explained about when he got headaches. Was his fear of heights and flying anything to do with being one? As far as he knew no, he had no idea why he had issues with heights.Peter's hand darted up. "I do have something that's been really on my mind." He lowered his hand, squinting as he sorted out how to ask. "Okay so. I—I always kinda thought that werewolves were... you know... really... ummm..." He tugged at a lock of hair. "Really big. And muscle-y. You know." He did a flex, making a growling sound. "Big."Remus blushed hard at that. "A big brutish hulking form even as human?" he asked and Peter nodded. Remus sighed heavily. "Yeah, that's—""Cause you're not," Peter said."—um, yeah, it's a popular misconception.""You're so tiny," Peter continued, driving home the point he had already made."Yes, I—I'm aware," Remus mumbled, wondering just how red he was getting."And clumsy," Sirius said, and Remus shot a glare at him. "What? Wolves are all... agile and graceful. You constantly fall down and run into walls."Remus slumped down. "Okay—""Yeah," James agreed. "You trip over literally nothing all the—""Okay I get the point!" Remus squeaked angrily, feeling like he was on fire with how much blood was rushing to his face. All three of his friends were smirking. "I was a person before I was bitten, you know! All werewolves are! So we come in all shapes and forms. Some are big, I imagine, and some are graceful, and some—""Are tiny little clumsy boys," Sirius cut in, and Remus kicked his foot.Thankfully after the other three giggled the conversation shifted away from his physical appearance and lack of balance. They wanted to know exactly which teachers knew. "The Heads, so Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, Sprout, and Slughorn; then Professor Prewett as well, since he teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts and would probably be able to guess," Remus said, ticking the names off his fingers."Sluggy knows?" James crinkled his nose up a bit."Why would Prewett be able to guess because of what he teaches?" Peter asked.Remus pulled a loose thread out of his robes, watching it drift to the floor. "Eventually... the class will b-be covering... w—werewolves," he whispered. "I—I'm in the curriculum. From what I can tell we're commonly taught in the third year.""Oh. Oh." Peter bit his bottom lip. "I g-guess I didn't think about you being—about werewolves being, um, Dark Arts. S—sorry that was stupid of me. Most the, um, books we looked at were in the c-creatures section.""S'ok." Remus managed a small smile. "It—""Dedenne knew about you then," Sirius said, cutting Remus off.Remus shifted, tugging at his sleeve again. "Yes. I was g—going to say something last night when you mentioned how I was acting last year, when I went a little cuckoo however figured it would be best to say this to everyone. D—Dedenne knew about me, and that's why she hated me. She's never met my father. I—I had to come up with a lie to explain her disdain." He pulled at his sleeve, sweat forming under his arms and on his palms now. "The f-first time I met her she s—said she didn't care but then proceeded to insinuate I was stupid.""Stupid?" James choked. "You?!"Remus shrugged. "One of the p—popular images of a werewolf is just a dumb beast, with no intellect at—" He stopped because they were all laughing hard."S-sorry!" Sirius shrieked, wiping his eyes. "You're literally the smartest student in our year! Probably the smartest student in the school!""I'm n—not, but thank you," Remus said, smiling broadly now, flustered again. "But it is one of the stereotypes. We're dumb animals, who don't know much beyond the basics.""Dedenne said this about you?" Peter asked in disbelief, still snickering a bit though."Yes. She told me if I can't keep up she's not going to make any special cases for me," he explained, toeing the ground. "That's why she gave me such terrible grades all the time, and mistreated me in class. When she—she yelled at me for shooting those sparks when we first learned. And..." He ducked his head down, focusing on his hand which was tracing designs on the stone. "When I w—went missing... when everyone was looking for me... when you said I looked really out of it and stuff?" They all nodded to indicate they knew what he was referring to. "She—she said stuff to me. That's why I—I snapped. She said a bunch of horrible stuff and I just couldn't focus on anything, like what happened when you guys told me you knew. I just... snapped."Sirius opened his mouth then closed it. He clenched his teeth, body shaking as his hands curled tightly into fists. James was breathing heavily, body tense. Peter was just staring blankly at Remus. All three of them smelled furious. Then they all began talking at once."It's people like her who are real monsters!""How could she? How dare she?""She—she treated you like dirt the entire year just because of this?!""Good thing she's gone otherwise she'd get it! If I ever see her again—""I can't believe anyone would do anything like that—""That isn't right I mean yeah it was bad enough cause of her hating you cause of your dad but—""Guys!" Remus cried out, shutting them up. "Forget it! She's gone—""Bloody good thing she is otherwise she'd be getting it," Sirius snarled.Remus ignored him. "She's long gone, and she won't be back.""If she ever tries she'll regret it," Sirius said, still furious, fingers twitching towards his wand."And—and she wasn't even far off with what she said, a lot of it was just the truth."James reached over, grabbing Remus's hand. "Whatever she said to you she's wrong, okay?" He held tightly, leaning in uncomfortably close. "She was just a bitter hag who hated the fact you were smarter than her."Remus snorted and covered his mouth with his other hand, trying not to laugh at that. He was too emotionally drained to really laugh but it was rather an amusing thought. James squeezed his hand then let go, settling back."What if she says something to someone though?" Peter asked anxiously. "If she hates you so much...""Her—her memory of me was erased," Remus replied. "That... is why she was fired though, because of how she treated me. Or maybe she quit. I don't know. Dumbledore wasn't very clear. He said she left of her own accord but I don't know if I believe him.""I don't want our heads messed up, but I'm glad Dumbles did it to her," said Sirius. James and Peter made noises of agreement. "Prewett is treating you well?""Yes, very much so," Remus said, smiling once more. "I was afraid he wouldn't because in our first meeting he said he didn't know much about werewolves, which was the same thing Dedenne said, but Prewett is... very kind. Kinder than I ever expected..."James squinted. "Do you really feel like you don't deserve any kindness because of being a werewolf?""That is exactly how I feel," Remus grumped right back then pressed his lips thin, regretting his tone. "Look, you—you read about werewolves, didn't you? About how hated we are?""Yes, but—""That's what I've grown up with," Remus went on before James could argue. "I—I'm sorry if it's annoying to you but it's impossible to see myself any different when that's pretty much all that's crammed down my throat at every turn my whole life!"Sirius moved closer, putting his warm hand against Remus's back. "I... guess we hadn't thought of that," he admitted.Remus sniffled. "I don't imagine you would but—but it won't just... go away because you say you don't see me differently. I have to go through every day knowing the wrong step could result in my death. I've spent eight years being told to never speak to anyone, of keeping myself quiet and hidden and not to do anything. When I came here I was told to not make friends, to not put my head up, to avoid any attention because someone might figure it out." He sniffled again, wiping his nose off on his robes sleeve, hoping he'd have time to go get clean ones before History. "Maybe not everyone thinks I deserve to die for what I am but I have to pretend like they do, for my own safety. And that... that wears on you.""You spent... your whole life seeing everyone as the enemy," James said slowly, and Remus nodded. "Merlin. No wonder you couldn't talk when you started school.""I—I had never been around anyone else, just my parents, as long as I could remember. I had met my father's boss once or twice, and went out with my parents on the rare occasion, but p-pretty much it was just me and them, that's it. I was... terrified when I got onto the train. I was terrified for so long." It felt good to be able to tell them this, to admit how he had felt. Especially since none of them looked amused or pitying about it. "I'm still... scared... a lot. Last month I had a b—bit of a breakdown over the whole thing.""When?" Sirius asked, curious."Um. Remember that night you brought me those cookies? It was that day. When Hagrid told you I seemed lonely? I w-went to him so I could spend time with Rocky, because I w-wanted company and with Rocky I d—didn't have to worry about how I might come across.""Do you worry about that with us?" James asked.Remus bit his bottom lip. "Yes," he said, not surprised to see their faces fall. "I had to.""Well, now you don't," Peter said cheerfully.Remus blinked a few times then straightened up, realizing Pete was right. If by some miracle Fawley agreed to keep this a secret then—then he'd be able to relax a little when it was just the four of them. It would probably take time before he was able to, but he wondered what it would be like."You're right," he said with a smile. That... that would be so nice...Unfortunately just then James's watch went off indicating they didn't have a lot of time before History. They gathered everything then hurried as fast as they could to the Gryffindor tower so Remus could change out of snotty robes and into clean ones, then ran all the way down to History, skidding into the classroom just as the bell rang.

After Transfiguration on Friday, McGonagall asked Remus to stay behind. She inquired after his health, then told him Pomfrey needed to see him sometime before supper. He went directly after he left class, promising the Marauders he'd meet up with them after whatever Pomfrey wanted which turned out just to be a checkup. She was very pleased he had gained a little bit of weight back. She asked to see him again on Sunday afternoon then sent him off after making him promise not to stress out too much. He wanted to laugh that. He felt like he was nothing but stress! Not that he told her that; he didn't want to be shut up in the hospital wing again.Back up in the dorms the other Marauders were waiting for him, wanting to start their 'plan of attack', as James put it, to figure out how to convince Fawley. They wanted to know about her: what she liked, didn't like, what made her laugh... That's when he admitted to them that she had pretty much seen all their pranks since the beginning, and was quite amused by them."She said she was a bit of a troublemaker back in her day, though no where near as bad as us," Remus explained. He and Peter were stretched out on Peter's bed while Sirius paced, and James wrote down notes. "She's kept all our pranks a secret. She was a little upset over the mandrake one, but says as long as we aren't causing serious damage to a person she won't say anything to Dumbledore."James tapped the end of the quill against his chin. "Does she know about my cloak?"Remus ducked his head. "Um, yeah. S—sorry.""It's fine, just curious..."Remus still felt bad though. Some Marauder secrets had remained a secret but Fawley knew so much because of him. He felt like he had betrayed his friends."What's Occel... Ocluman... ummm, what's your lessons like?' Pete asked as he tore a licorice wand into thinner strips."They give me headaches sometimes," he said and Peter made a face. "I have to empty myself of all emotions—thanks," he grumbled when Sirius snorted."It's just you're a pretty emotional person," Sirius said with a helpless sort of smile."I know," he said with a scowl, "and that's why it's really hard for me. She—she says I'm making good progress though, for someone my age." He sat up cross-legged, resting his hands on his knees. "Since she's blind she can't make eye contact, so she puts her hand on my head and enters my memories that way. It's really weird... like... I can see my own memories being dredged up and flipped through, like a picture book.""So you go through the memories too?" James asked."Yes..." Remus frowned, remembering some of the painful ones he had to endure. "It's not very pleasant sometimes. But I can't really control what she sees—well, that's not entirely true. If I focus on a memory enough she will see that memory. But," he added as Sirius opened his mouth, "she knows I'm doing it, and I can't fight her off while doing that." Sirius closed his mouth, frowning. "In order to fight her off I have to really focus on keeping myself empty, and keeping her out of my head."James adjusted his glasses. "Sounds difficult.""It is," Remus admitted, "and normally someone my age wouldn't be learning but as I said, Dumbledore felt I should begin immediately help keep my secret.""And we'll do it too," Sirius said with a nod. "Somehow we'll convince her.""Yeah...""You don't think we will?" Pete asked, looking up at Remus.He couldn't help but give a sigh. "No, to be perfectly frank with you. I want to be able to convince her. However she really feels our bond is too close, and she doesn't trust any of you.""'Specially me," Sirius said and Remus nodded miserably. "I'll be the hardest part of the whole thing, to get her on our side...""Yes," Remus said. "Unfortunately."Sirius just smiled, walking over to tousle Remus's hair. Normally Remus didn't like it when he did that but this time he didn't mind; it was familiar, and friendly, and since Sirius knew, and Remus knew Sirius knew, it rather felt nice that he was willing to make that sort of contact with him. He still pouted and tried to smooth his hair down afterward, not wanting Sirius to know how much he had liked it."It'll work out," James said, scratching down more words on his parchment. "It has to.""When a Marauder puts his mind to something, it gets done!" Peter said, raising a strip of licorice wand in the air victoriously."Here, here!" Sirius agreed with a laugh./\/\/\/\/\It was weird going back to study group that night, since he had missed so much. Everyone was very happy to see him though. Well... Twycross and Craft were impartial, but they didn't count. Bones even got up to give Remus a clap on the back and after Remus sat down Silverlocke leaned in closer to tell him how glad he was to see him back."Th—thank you, all," Remus murmured, hoping he wasn't blushing too hard."Hopefully it's not going to be too hard for you to catch up," Twycross said, breaking the mood. "You missed so many days of classes. You probably have a ton of homework to catch up on too! I mean, we've done most of it already—""Twycross, shut up," Pierce said.Twycross stared open-mouthed (which looked utterly hilarious) then snapped her mouth shut so quick they all heard her teeth click. Her face flooded with color and Remus could smell the anger rolling off of her. "I was just—""I'm sure it won't take Lupin very long to get caught up with us," Buckling said, drumming her fingers on the table.He was a little lost when they began but did quickly pick everything up. He had quite a bit of homework due so instead of going back to the tower with Lily and Twycross like usual, he remained in the library; Silverlocke remained behind as well. He had some homework he wanted to take care of and did Remus mind if they shared the table? Remus promised he didn't mind at all, and was grateful for the company. They talked a bit while they worked. It had been a couple weeks since they started their research into that weird pit passage, and despite spending quite a bit of time researching none of the three could really find out any information, and now that Remus was leaving Hogwarts he told Silverlocke he was just going to 'let it be' until 'later'."I'll let Lily know. I just feel like I'd rather focus on school for the time being," he said."Understandable," Silverlocke agreed. "It's so strange there's nothing though.""Very strange." Remus sorta wanted to take Silverlocke to the passage but the babbling brew was still bubbling away there, although it would be finished tomorrow. Maybe Sunday he could take him. Or would that be another betrayal to the Marauders? "I'm glad we're friends," he suddenly blurted out, realizing how much he'd miss Silverlocke. They didn't spend much time together and Remus wished they had done more.Silverlocke's eyes went huge and he was clearly startled. Was Remus wrong in saying 'friends'? But then his cheeks went a little pink and he smiled. "I'm glad we are too," he said. "Would it be presumptuous of me to call you Remus?""Not at all, if I can call you Aegis," Remus replied then felt guilty for doing this so soon before dropping out. He hoped Silver—Aegis wouldn't be too mad. "Um, though I should tell you something." It didn't feel right, not giving him warning. Aegis tilted his head curiously, waiting. "It's because I was in the hospital wing so long this time. I'm not sure if I feel... up to... well, I—I've been considering the possibility of having to go home. Drop—dropping out, I mean, due to my, um, my health. I'm not sure yet—I just... wanted to let you know."Something flashed through Aegis's blue eyes and he looked quite sad. "I'm very sorry to hear that, although your health is very important. You haven't decided yet?""N... no. I want to stay but I'm just going to see how I feel over the next few days."Aegis nodded. "I really appreciate you letting me know. I hope you choose to stay here, however as I said... health is important, so I can understand that decision." Aegis hesitated a moment then added, "I am also sorry your health has declined so much. If there's anything I can do to help, I am here for you."Remus smiled. "Thank you."/\/\/\/\/\That night the Marauders stayed up quite late which was becoming their usual Friday and Saturday routine, but Remus felt brave enough to say he'd like to retire earlier than usual since he was pretty tired still from the week. He made it clear he didn't expect anyone else to go to bed too but all three of them went up to bed when he did at around one-thirty in the morning.Remus didn't go to sleep right away, though. He sat up in bed, knitting the hat he hoped he'd still be able to give Sirius while thinking about how to convince Fawley. She'll never agree, he thought as he worked on the last row. How can we possibly convince her it's okay a bunch of kids my age knows? He cut the yarn and wove in the tail, studying the hat carefully. It looked okay. Not great, but not the worst. He got out his gold yarn and am embroidery needle to start working on the lion's paw which was going to be infinity more hard. Perhaps he should have just made a striped scarf or something. He intended to make a hat for Peter too, providing he was still here (which he wouldn't be) but what could he make James? By the time the end of March rolled around it would still be cold but heading towards warmer weather so he wasn't sure if a hat would be the best choice, but he kinda wanted to make them all the same thing... so maybe it'd be okay?He shook his head. What am I thinking? I won't even be here. He pulled out the gold yarn since everything was crooked and tried again. Maybe if I tell her what Prewett said, about how it'd be a shame if my mind went to waste... and me going home, well, I'd still be able to read and stuff but it wouldn't be a proper education. Maybe that would work?He carefully outlined the paw again, trying his best to make it look nice. A homemade hat was probably a very dumb gift to give to a thirteen year old boy but he didn't know what else to do, since he didn't have any way to buy anything. Ugh Sirius is just gonna laugh at it, he thought grouchily, throwing the whole thing down on his blanket. They're all gonna laugh at me when they find out I'm knitting!He furiously stuffed everything into the bag his mother had sent with the yarn and crawled to the end of his bed so he could quietly tuck it into his trunk, careful not to make too much noise. Once that was taken care of he flopped back, pulling Gwyllgi out from under his pillow. He curled up with the black dog, nuzzling against the worn fur, and drifting into a surprisingly peaceful sleep./\/\/\/\/\Remus was forced out of his peaceful sleep at around nine in the morning by a loud thud and an even louder scream followed by cries of pain along with laughter. He rubbed his eyes as he peered out of the curtains. James was rolling on the floor clutching his knee while Sirius was doubled over with laughter."Stoooop!" James whined. "It huuuurt!""What's going on?" Remus asked, sliding out of bed. Something felt off... wrong..."The Mighty James Potter was trying to show off his newest talent," snorted Sirius, jerking his thumb over towards James's broom which was hovering quite high."I almost got it!" James whimpered then slowly got up, testing his weight on the injured knee. "You distracted me," he accused, glaring at Sirius.Sirius pressed a hand against his chest, looking mock-distraught. "Oh, I distracted you? That's what happened, eh? Not, you know, the fact you tried to do a leaping mount off your bed onto your impossibly high broom?"James wiped his nose off onto his pajama sleeve then got back onto his bed. "Exactly."By this point Remus figured out what was wrong: nothing. That was the problem. It was so normal. It could have been any other weekend morning. He had expected something different, because they knew. He wasn't sure what... just... he couldn't help but feel a little thrown that they were being so normal."Where's Peter?" Remus asked, a little surprised their friend hadn't made an appearance."Oh, he got up forever ago actually," Sirius said, going closer to Remus. "He's out taking pictures with his club." He made a face. "Can you believe it? They got up to photograph the sunrise! SUNRISE! Bloody insane, if you ask me."James jumped, fingers just skimming along the broom handle but he didn't have any kind of grasp and he crashed to the floor again, this time with swearing."Jimmy, just lower the broom," Sirius said, folding his arms."I can do it!""No, what you can do is break all the bones in your body!" Sirius said. "Just lower it."James got up, rubbing his backside, grumbling to himself. "Down!" he ordered, stretching his hand out. Nothing happened. "Ugh. Come! Oh come on." He dragged his trunk over, standing on top of it, and still couldn't quite reach it. "Sirius?"Sirius got up on the trunk and managed to snag the broom. "Your broom isn't obeying you.""My broom is still new," James said, taking his broom and hopping to the ground. "It's really good but distant commands are still a little whacko."Remus took a step back as James turned, the handle of the broom waving a foot or so away from Remus. Now that they knew he could tell them how dangerous silver was to him, but it wasn't as if James was forcing him to touch the broom. Plus he was putting it into the carrying case. Remus thought it'd be silly to complain or bring it up at this point (especially since he'd be gone soon) so he kept quiet.The doors flung open and a tired looking Peter came in. "Oh good you're all up! LOOK! Merlin's beard you won't beLIEVE it!" He grabbed Sirius—the nearest Marauder—and pulled him over to his bed. James and Remus followed, all of them gasping appropriately as Peter showed them one of the photos he had taken of the sun rising. He had developed it in wizarding fluid so they could see the brilliant orange rays spangling out."That is amazing," James said."Merlin's beard!" said Sirius."You are so talented!" added Remus.Peter went even redder. "It's not that great, it's kinda blurry here and I didn't get a great angle, and when I developed it I kinda messed up one of the washings.""Nah, it's beautiful," James said, punching Peter's arm. "Is this a copy? Can we have it?""Um, yeah, I made a couple."James used a sticking spell to put the photo up on the wall between his and Peter's beds. "Ta-da!"Sirius patted Peter's back and Remus wanted to, but felt awkward still purposely touching now that they knew the truth. Peter had hugged him before but... he still wanted to be cautious. So instead he clapped, grinning at Peter who looked very proud of himself. He showed off some of the other pictures he took as well, then the lot of them went down for a slightly late breakfast (after those needing dressed got dressed, of course), which they plowed through as quickly as they could. There were more important things to do.As soon as the last crumb was gone they took off, darting through the halls, getting in trouble with a Hufflepuff prefect they nearly knocked to his feet. Remus called out an apology but as the others didn't stop running he didn't either. The prefect shouted they all had two points taken off their house, not that any of them really paid much attention.The reached the pits passage and hurried across the first pit, going to the cauldron full of babbling brew. It was pretty much the same shade as in the book and looked to be the right consistency. James and Sirius hauled it off the fire then set it aside while Peter got rid of the fire."Who's testing it?" Peter asked, plucking at his lower lip, eyes darting around since he knew he'd be the one volunteered."You want to?" James asked.Peter frowned, averting his gaze. "I... guess I can...""Come on, stop making him your lab rat," Remus said."Our what?" James asked."Test subject. You always make him test potions like this. How about one of you do it?"Sirius grinned. "You wanna test it then?""Oh!" he said, getting awkward. "Er. I can... try. Um. I think it will be fine for the babbling brew but—erm, well, a lot of potions don't affect me the way they should.""What do you mean?" Sirius asked."I'm not sure which part of my... er... ly—lycanthropy does it, but a lot of potions don't work. Like dreamless sleep potion won't work right, nor do regular sleeping draughts. I think they sorta work... but wear off very quickly." He went bright pink saying all this, feeling super weird for being able to."Ooh," Pete breathed out. "So you can't test it?"Remus shrugged. "I don't know how well it will work on me, although I think it should work correctly.""Then you can do the strips of paper for us to pull," James said, and Remus looked confused. "We'll draw straws," he explained, and Peter looked relieved.Remus got out some parchment and used a potions knife to slice up three identical pieces of paper. At the bottom of one he wrote 'test'. He shuffled the strips up then tucked them in his hand, holding his fist out. Sirius was the unlucky guinea pig. He crinkled his nose up but grabbed one of the stirring spoons, scooping up a small amount."Here goes nothing." He poured it into his mouth and swallowed. The others waited, watching him in case it did something else to him physically."Well?" James asked."Hurbaa," Sirius replied then his eyes went wide. "Baalba oooba dohee." James, Peter, and Remus shrieked with laughter and Sirius was grinning. "Urwa toomy ooh heeba!"They were rolling on the floor laughing now. Remus laughed until he couldn't breathe, legs kicking in the air as he clutched his sides. "The—the entire—entire—G—Great—Hall!" he managed to wheeze out."This is gonna be one of the best pranks ever!" Peter gasped out."I can't wait, Merlin I can't wait!" James squealed."Nersha boolie teeba!" Sirius said which made them all laugh even more."Okay, I have to," James said, wiping a tear away as he took the spoon and drank a tiny bit. "How long does it t—immla lula ponshy?"Peter took a little bit. "Goolba nuno meerma!"Remus took the spoon, eyeing the liquid before tipping it into his mouth, very careful to make sure none of the spoon touched his mouth. He swallowed then waited for a few seconds. The others were leaning forward, very intent to see if this would work. "Biba snooda werly."They all collapsed back with more laughter."Heebo larma timoo, flenny graw nee!" James exclaimed then shook his head, taking the leftover paper so he could write down: can we do this in spell form? then brandished the question at Remus.He frowned, rubbing his chin. "Deesh gerbit ghibb," he replied then grinned and shrugged. He took the quill from James. I think there's a babbling curse."LEEHA!" James shrieked as he pumped his fist. He didn't need to write down that he was saying 'yes!'.Remus was the first to recover, followed by Sirius, then James, then finally Peter. Once they managed to calm down they began pouring the potion into the jars they had brought, discussing the best way to get this into the systems of everyone. Since there wasn't one item that everyone ate that meant they'd have to put it in multiple foods."The actual dinner, or dessert?" Sirius asked."Not everyone has dessert," Remus pointed out from where he sat a little aways from them, hands around his legs. Even though pouring potion wasn't the worst thing, he was very clumsy and none of them wanted to risk him dropping a jar full of the precious prank."We'll mix it in with dinner," decided James. "Gravy, pumpkin juice, mashed potatoes, yeah. Lots of stuff.""Are we gonna have any of it?" Peter asked.James smirked. "Yes. First of all, it's bloody hilarious. Second of all, less suspicion on us."Sirius snorted, screwing the lid onto the jar he just finished, carefully setting it aside. "Oh right like we won't be the first names that cross McGonsie's mind as soon as everyone starts going blibble blabble."James cast him an amused look. "Maybe, but we'll be blibble blabbling along with everyone else!"Remus couldn't wait. It was going to be good, and definitely a great final prank for him to have locked away in his memories.

Saturday was turning into another one of those perfect days, which Remus was glad for. The morning with the other Marauders was great then after lunch he spent time with Aegis in one of the courtyards. They played chess for a while then switched to gobstones. Remus enjoyed gobstones for the most part. The smell was horrific so he gagged a lot, but because it was supposed to be stinky he didn't feel weird gagging so much. As they were gathering up the gobstones some older Slytherins walked by and decided to harass them."Look at the babies, playing a baby game," said the blonde haired boy Remus realized was Lucius Malfoy from Slug Club. He kicked the gobstone Aegis was reaching for, sending it careening off. "Oops."Aegis's cheeks went a little pink but he silently went after the marble. Remus stood up, scowling. If it had just been him he'd've scurried off without another word but he wasn't going to let a bully give crap to his friend. "L-l-l-leave us alone," he said.Malfoy's mouth curved into a big smile which was creepier than anything else. "Wh-wh-what was that?""Remus—" Aegis whispered as he came back over."M-making fun of my st-stutter? How origin—nal, and q-q-quick-witted of you," Remus retorted, making a show of rolling his eyes to show how bored he was of that being an insult.Malfoy didn't take too kindly to that. He got his wand out, pointing it into Remus's face, grey eyes flashing with anger. "Have something to say, Loopy?"Aegis tugged at Remus's sleeve. "We were just leaving," he told Malfoy then began pulling Remus away.Malfoy grinned broader. "As I thought. Best be getting a shower to get rid of that Gryffindor stench, Silverlocke. Or is that gobstones? It's always difficult to tell the difference."Aegis's face went even pinker as he yanked Remus into the covered area and then into the school. "You should not have said anything to him," he said, finally letting go.Remus brushed himself off. "I'm n-not afraid of him," he lied.Aegis raised one eyebrow. "Perhaps you aren't, but I'd prefer not to antagonize him. He's one of the biggest bullies in Slytherin. He even torments older students. And he's—" Aegis stopped then sighed, dropping the remainder of his gobstones into the bag, not saying anything else."I... I'm sorry, I wasn't really thinking about how it might effect you," Remus said, regretting doing what he did."It's fine. I admire your courage."They split up shortly after as they both needed showers. After Remus got cleaned up he hung out in the dorm with Peter since James and Sirius were off doing who-knows-what. Well, first Remus just worked on homework while Peter napped, but once Peter got up they hung out. Remus was kinda glad it was just the two of them. It made him feel a lot better about how Peter might be feeling. Peter was definitely not the bravest out of all of them so Remus wondered if maybe Peter was just okay with the werewolf thing with the others around, so the fact he was sitting on his bed with Remus playing cards just the two of them... it was great. Also it felt so normal. Like, he had also been worried that the others would just want to hover around him all the time just to prove something, but no; it was like it always had been.After a while Remus grew very curious. "Can I ask you something?"Peter smiled. "Of course."Remus stared intently at his cards. "I don't... scare you?""N—no!" Peter said, falsely cheerful.Remus pressed his lips thin. "I can tell you're lying."For several seconds Peter didn't say anything while Remus tried not to squirm. Finally he said, "Yeah a little but not like... I don't... ummm..." He sucked in some air. "I don't see you as something scary. Like, um, I know you're a... you know what, and that is kinda scary, but you're not scary to me. Does that make sense?""I think so.""I'm sorry..."Remus finally glanced up. "No, don't be. I'm glad you are.""Really?""Yes." He began rearranging his cards, chewing at his bottom lip. "There's nothing wrong with being scared of a—of what I am. A lot of people are." Part of him was confused as to why his friends weren't that scared, and the other part wanted them to be afraid. Wanted them to face the truth. Regardless of whether or not they viewed him as a monster, he became something horrifying and violent and he wished they'd at least accept that.Peter began shaking his head. "But I'm not scared of you like that...! I mean..." He groaned loudly, tapping his cards against his chin. "I can't see you like that, okay? I know what, um, you're supposed to look like when you're like that, and it is scary. But it's hard for me to, um, to see you like that, so it's not really you I'm scared of. I'm not making much sense am I?""I am like that though," Remus said softly, focusing on his cards again. "I am a monster.""Nope. You're not a monster. I'm with Siri and Jimmy on that one. Also, I win the round," he said, slapping down his winning hand.Remus smiled, not saying anything else on the matter. But apparently Peter wasn't done because after he dealt a new hand out he leaned forward, tilting his head so he could look into Remus's face."Remus, you are my friend."He was rather startled by this statement and nearly dropped his cards. "You're my friend too," he promised, and Peter grinned broadly./\/\/\/\/\The rest of the day went by pretty well. Once the other Marauders came back the four of them wandered around the school, goofing off, joking, trying to find secret passages. James and Sirius talked a lot about the map they were working on, complaining that it was super hard to do because things kept changing around and moving.After supper Remus studied in the library with Lily and Macdonald for a bit, then by himself when Lily walked Macdonald back to the common room for her curfew. A little after they left he went into the creature section, fingers running across the spines of all the books, looking for the word werewolf. He hadn't read a whole lot of the books in here about himself so he was wondering what his friends had read, how hateful the works might be.Remus's finger stopped on one title, a very slim novel that sent his heart up into his throat. The Cure For Lycanthropy. It was the book his father made him read whenever Lyall thought he needed reminded on how important it was for him to stay hidden. Inside was the stuff of nightmares, at least to Remus; stories of how the best way to deal with a werewolf was to kill one. He shuddered and walked forward, then froze seeing his own name on a book.He felt like he might vomit.He felt like he might cry.Slowly he turned, trembling from head to foot until he saw the title properly and let out a sigh of relief. It said Lupine, not Lupin. Close, though. He tilted his head to read the whole title. Lupine Lawlessness: Why Lycanthropes Don't Deserve To Live. His heart pounded in his chest as he hooked his finger over the spine, sliding it out of place. It had a picture of a full moon on the front with a silhouette of a werewolf howling. He opened the cover to see the publication date. It was published earlier that year. 1972. For a split second of pure anger he wondered why Dumbledore allowed the book in the library, then that quickly ebbed away as he knew all sorts of books were in the library. Good and bad.He started to put the book back into place then yanked it back out, going over to his table. He gathered his stuff then wandered over to one of the tables with a cloth over it, climbing underneath to hide as he began reading. It was full of postulations and exclamations of how werewolves were beasts all the time, that once bitten they should never be considered human, of how no werewolf has any sort of humanity or morals. It gave examples of vicious werewolves throughout the past, glorifying the heroes who had defeated them. Obviously, by the title, death was the best route for werewolves.Remus didn't read it all, just enough of it to make him both furious and depressed, on the edge of another breakdown. He wanted to tear the book into shreds but that'd raise an alarm and get Farrow's attention. He forced himself out from under the table so he could put the book back then left the library, shaking with rage, trying to force himself to calm down; he didn't want to try to explain to his friends what made him so upset.By the time he reached the tower he was able to fake a believable smile, and none of the Marauders seemed the wiser./\/\/\/\/\Remus was playing gobstones by himself. The courtyard stretched into an eternity, the castle no where in sight. He flicked one of the gobstones and a boot came down, holding it into place. He looked up into this nearly formless, faceless being who grinned wickedly. Lycanthropes don't deserve to live, it said then kicked the gobstone back. Play you for your life. Remus didn't want to but he crouched next to the being and began playing. The being scored the first point, and a squirt of smelly liquid flew at Remus—except it wasn't smelly liquid, it was liquid silver and it burned his flesh. He cried out but the being demanded they keep playing. Remus kept losing, his skin bubbling up every time the liquid silver hit it. You don't deserve to live! the being laughed as Remus thrashed on the ground, crying out in agony. You're nothing but a bloodthirsty monster! You're going to kill your friends! The being's voice started sounding a lot like Dedenne. You'll kill them all! There was a flash of silver coming for his neck—And Remus woke up crying out, begging for mercy. "Please—no—I d-didn't—I won't...!" He panted for air then shoved up the sleeves of his pajama, running his fingers along his smooth, unblemished skin. He curled forward, covering his face, crying softly. He didn't say anything went Sirius tapped at his bed."Remus?" He opened the curtains and climbed in, shutting the curtains carefully behind him."I'm fine," Remus said automatically, still covering his face. "I'm f-fine.""You don't need to lie anymore." Sirius gently pried his hands away from his face so he could look into Remus's eyes. "They're connected to what you are, aren't they? The nightmares?" Remus stared blankly at him. "You don't need to pretend anymore."Remus trembled then hunched forward again, rubbing his sleeve against his eyes as Sirius pat his back. Sirius was right. The realization that he could be honest about what happened in his nightmares settled around him like a warm blanket. "Yes," he whispered.Sirius adjusted his position, sitting closer now. "Wanna talk about it?" Suddenly he wasn't sure if he should say it or not, actually tell him what he had seen in his nightmare. He just shrugged. "Okay. If you do, I'm here.""I t-t-told you before that they're of me dying," Remus said quietly, very quietly. He wasn't even sure if Sirius could hear him. "That wasn't a complete lie. That's what they usually are. Someone—someone killing me." His voice dropped even lower, hardly audible at all. "Or me killing someone."Sirius drew in a sharp breath so Remus knew he had heard every word. "Damn. That—I—..." He trailed off then put his hand back on Remus's back. It was so warm, radiating out along Remus's spine and he resisted the urge to lean in closer. "Which one was it tonight?"Remus hiccuped a little and then wiped his nose off onto his sleeve. "Someone killing me."Sirius remained quiet and Remus wondered if he was supposed to tell him everything. He didn't want to, not every little detail. Especially since they were slipping away. The most he could remember was the liquid silver, the laughing, the voice saying he'd kill his friends..."I won't let that happen," Sirius finally said.Remus choked now, trying not to laugh. "What? You? Okay, um, well first of all you're—you're twelve!"Sirius grinned at him. "Thirteen, in a few days."Remus rolled his eyes. "Oh. Well, in that case."Sirius nudged him gently. "I mean it though. James and Petey, they'd say the same. We'll protect you.""It isn't that easy.""S'not that easy to cross the Marauders either," Sirius said very loftily, sounding a lot like James.Remus snorted, burying his face in his hands again mostly to stop from laughing. "I don't get it.""Get what?""How you can make me laugh after—after a nightmare like that."Sirius leaned back, propping himself up on his arms. Remus was a little sad Sirius's hand wasn't still on his back. "Talent," Sirius replied with a twinkle in his eye. "I'm glad I can though."Remus wanted even more to scoot closer, to lean against him. That thought terrified him because he didn't understand why he had it, why he wanted it so badly, why his body was practically yearning to curl up next to Sirius, and why it also made him feel so hot but also, somehow, hollow. So instead he inched a little bit away. "Me too," he said, knowing he probably sounded awkward now. "I'm glad we're friends."Sirius looked up at him. "Really? You're not still mad?"Remus slowly shook his head, plucking at one of the holes in his pajama bottoms. "No. I haven't been mad for a few days. I don't think I was ever really mad-mad anyway. Mostly... shocked. And scared." He straightened his legs out, trying to focus on anything except the confusing feelings flitting around. "I wanted to ask you something though. You said you figured it out ages ago but—but last month you were asking me things like if my disease was fatal?"Sirius ran his fingers through his hair. "Yeah. I was mostly trying to get you to tell me. I thought if I asked you if you were dying you'd tell me the truth.""Ahh.""Unfortunately my plan backfired," he continued, sounding amused. "Course, I didn't know a ton about—about your thing, so when you started saying all that I got kinda scared maybe you would die. That's why I brought it up so many times, after I figured it out.""You know how much everyone hates us," Remus pointed out, "yet you still kept thinking I'd just tell you."Sirius nudged him again, arm brushing against his which made Remus go very hot on the outside and squirmy on the inside. "Guess I'm just optimistic.""Well, go be optimistic in your own bed," Remus said, not wanting Sirius to notice how flustered he suddenly was. "I'm going to try to go back to sleep.""All right." Sirius slithered out of his bed. "G'nite, Remy.""Goodnight, Siri.""Oi!"Remus waited till he heard Sirius go to his own bed then he turned his pillow around, pressing his hot cheek against the cool fabric, thinking he'd rather be dealing with his nightmares than whatever this was./\/\/\/\/\Sunday morning was very rainy, though James still had a Quidditch practice to go to. The others went to watch with raincoats and umbrellas. Remus brought a higher grade charm book with him to see if he could figure out how to repel rain. Sirius and Peter both had binoculars with them and after several minutes Remus tugged at Pete's sleeve, asking to borrow his. He began tapping them with his wand, muttering a water repellent spell over and over. They wouldn't be learning it until near the end of their third year, possibly beginning of their fourth, but he figured he could probably do it. After half a dozen failed attempts he gave Pete the binoculars back and began trying it instead on his own shoes. They were already soaked through but after twenty minutes one of them began rolling water off of it. He grinned, and kept trying until he noticed the water droplets would swerve away about a quarter of an inch from his shoe. He tried the other one and it took about five minutes to get it done. He then enchanted both sets of binoculars."Wa-hey!" Sirius exclaimed, putting them back up to his eyes. "You're a genius."Remus tugged at the collar of his raincoat, sweaty and fatigued from attempting an advanced spell. He spent the remainder of the practice with his feet up on the bench, arms around his legs, eyes on the blur that was hopefully James and not one of his teammates. Finally practice ended, and the Marauders made their way down to meet up with James."Less than two weeks until my first game!" James shouted as they headed back to the school. "I'm so nervous.""You got it!" Sirius flung his arm around James's shoulders. "You're the best on the team."They went through a side entrance to hopefully avoid Filch yowling at them leaving wet footprints everywhere which turned out to be the best choice since after only a couple turns they heard crying, and mocking laughter. They all stopped, looking at each other, then hurried towards the sound. Two second year Slytherin girls were tormenting a first year Hufflepuff. They had her wand, tossing it back and forth while the Hufflepuff cried, hopping to try to catch her wand.James shoved his carrying case at Peter then stormed down the corridor, yanking his own wand out. "Expelliarmus!" he snapped when one of the Slytherins had a hold of the wand. It went flying out to James who caught it. "Leave her alone, Rosier!" He pointed his wand right at the bigger girl, the one who had hold of the wand.She tossed her hair back, sneering. "Gonna hex a girl, Pratty?"James smiled as he tossed the Hufflepuff girl her wand back. "I don't like hexing girls, but I don't have a problem with hexing a bully."The other Slytherin, named Urswick, pulled out her own wand. "Wanna go, Pratty?" But then she realized the other Marauders were there too Urswick's eyes got a little wide then she stepped back, closer to Rosier who was frowning."Ugh, four on two, typical Gryffindor behavior," Rosier said, straightening her shoulders."Two older students ganging up on one first year, typical Slytherin behavior," Sirius spat out.The two Slytherins debated their chances then put away their wands. "At least your brother's a true Black," Urswick said.Remus's hand darted out, grabbing Sirius's wrist as he raised his arm. "Don't ever talk about him," Sirius growled.Urswick smirked. "You know, if your mother wasn't such a pureblood paragon I'd suspect she cheated on your father to have you." She waited triumphantly for Sirius to react but he just narrowed his eyes, obviously not caring as much when his mother was insulted. Urswick's smile faded but she didn't say anything else, just spun on her heels and marched off with Rosier, both of them snickering to themselves. Sirius yanked his arm from Remus, grumbling.James turned to the Hufflepuff but she gave a squeak and ran off doing another passage. "Okay yeah, you're welcome," he grumbled.By the time they got to the dorms, dried off, got clean clothes on, and headed back down for lunch they had sorta put the incident out of their minds until halfway through eating McGonagall approached them, asking to see them for a moment. They followed her out of the Great Hall where she inquired about whether or not they had attacked two Slytherin girls earlier. The way she spoke it was clear she assumed they were guilty."What?" James and Sirius looked at one another in confusion."No, we never did anything like that," James said, then Sirius muttered 'not today at least' under his breath so low Remus suspected he was the only one who heard him.McGonagall looked down her nose at them, lips thin in disapproval. "I have two young ladies who insisted you hexed them earlier this morning.""Professor, I was at practice," James pointed out, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose.Peter coughed. "Um." Then he just squeaked as everyone looked at him. He turned red and stepped closer to Remus."Yes, Mr. Pettigrew?" McGonagall asked.Peter whimpered. "We, um, we c-came across two Slytherin girls, um, bugging another student and—and James stopped them. No hexes were used though.""Oh! Right!" Sirius said, snapping his fingers. "Urswick and Rosier."McGonagall frowned. "Those are the two insisting you bullied them. Are you saying you did not hurt them?""I used the disarming spell on Rosier," James said, putting his hands on his hips. "She had the Hufflepuff girl's wand. They were throwing it to each other over her head.""Which Hufflepuff?""I don't know her name," James said."Julie Macmillan," Sirius said.McGonagall asked them to wait then swept into the Great Hall."How do you know her name?" James asked.Sirius shrugged. "She's my cousin.""What?!" Remus and Peter chorused."Yeah, my grandmother is her great-aunt," Sirius said, sounding a little bored. "I don't know her that well. We've never really met. Just remembered her from the Sorting."Peter shook his head in disbelief. "How many cousins do you have?"Sirius grinned. "Too many.""I thought everyone hated the Blacks?" Remus asked, folding his arms, raising his eyebrows"They do... but we're also part of the sacred Twenty-Eight," Sirius informed him, poking at his ribs. Remus yelped, hopping away. "The purest of the pure. We might be crazy and evil, but everyone wants our magical—er, ancestry!"McGonagall came back out with the Hufflepuff girl, and Professor Sprout. The girl was quaking hard. "Miss Macmillan, can you please tell us what happened?" Sprout asked gently.The first year swallowed, looking down at her shoes. She told them that she had been walking through the halls when the Slytherin girls ambushed her and took her wand away. They had teased her, pulled at her braids, called her names, then took her wand from her. She confirmed they had been throwing it back and forth when the boys showed up."He got my wand away from one of them," she said, pointing at James. "He had his wand out. Then the two Slytherins got their wands out. But then they put them away. They insulted him—" she pointed at Sirius, "—then walked away."Sprout and McGonagall looked at each other. "Thank you, my dear," Sprout said. "You may go back to your lunch."Macmillan fled back into the Great Hall. McGonagall adjusted her glasses, turning back to the boys. "I'll be speaking to Professor Slughorn about this.""Are we in trouble?" Sirius asked, waving a hand through the air."I would assume not," McGonagall told him. "Miss Macmillan's story corroborated yours." With that she dismissed them and they returned to their lunches.James and Sirius glared at the Slytherin table. "They shouldn't even be allowed here," James said, viciously poking at his food without even looking at it. "Slytherins are all liars and cheats.""N—not Aegis," Remus said swiftly. They rolled their eyes at him."Who's Aegis?" Peter asked, making a face."Silverlocke," Sirius said before Remus could answer. "I suppose.""And Regulus," James said.Sirius smiled now. "Yeah. And Reg." He looked over at the Slytherin table again, this time with softer eyes. Regulus was sitting with the same first year that had asked him to play Sphinxes back when the Marauders invaded the Slytherin common room. They were talking quite happily. Suddenly Sirius stood up. "I'll be right back."He went over to the Slytherin table, interrupting his brother's conversation. Regulus frowned, forehead wrinkling as Sirius asked him something. He shrugged and wiped his slender fingers off on a napkin before getting up, following Sirius out of the Great Hall. Twenty minutes later the other Marauders finished their lunch and left the Great Hall. They found Sirius and Regulus talking down a side corridor, both brothers looking rather content.Sirius saw his friends then put a hand on Regulus's shoulder. "See you later," he said and went back to his friends, shoving his hands in his pockets and whistling very cheerfully. Remus was very glad Sirius had had a nice chat with Regulus, and hoped it would happen more often.

Author's note: two things! First of all, in direct regards of this chapter, the pairings were 100% random. I rolled dice to see who would be paired with who and it was a great outcome ahaha. Second of all: I want to shout out to my dear friend Angel! Been meaning to do this for a while and since she's been more active on AO3 (username: NoStringsOnMe, go check out her work if you don't mind the site!) I figured now would be a great chance. You would NOT be reading this if it wasn't for her! She encouraged me when I was writing the original version, and when I rewrote it she encouraged and pushed me to post it. I wasn't going to post this story because I thought, who would want to read such an extremely long haul daily life account of the Marauders? (lol was I wrong!) but she convinced me to. So I just wanted to thank her!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus woke up on Halloween morning feeling absolutely depressed. He lay still, staring up at the canopy overhead, stomach churning miserably. It's my last full day here, he thought, curling his fingers into the sheet beneath him. He'd have classes tomorrow too but after supper he'd be meeting with Fawley and then...Everything blows up.He heard other alarms going off, his dormmates waking up. He knew when James woke up because he heard a 'yesss' from across the room. It was Halloween and all four of them had been super excited all day Monday to wear their group costume. Remus was especially excited since it would be the only time he'd be able to do this with them, not that he let on; they were all very adamant about the idea convincing Fawley would work while Remus, though determined to try, accepted that it wouldn't.His curtains were flung back by James. "Morning, Athos!" he said brightly."Morning, d'Artagnan," Remus yawned, sitting up.Behind James he saw Sirius getting out of bed, and Peter's curtains were still shut but not for long because James darted over, yanking them aside. "Come on, wake up! It's Halloween!" James said, shaking Pete. "Porthos!""Awaa?" Peter lifted his head, blinking sleepily. "Ha'ween?'"Halloween!" James exclaimed, patting Peter's messy head. "Up and at'em."Remus rubbed his forehead as he got out of bed, hoping he'd be able to keep up his energy today. He wanted—needed the day to be perfect. "Are we wearing the costumes now or after Herbology?" he asked.James, who was in the middle of putting the tabard on, hesitated. "I forgot about that. Yeah, let's change after Herbology. Thanks, Brains.""We should just show up in our costumes and go, 'sorry Sprout we can't do today's class'," laughed Sirius.They weren't the only Gryffindors who realized it'd be dumb going to Herbology in costume. Everyone wore their uniforms to Herbology but then after showers there were quite a few costumes. Remus wasn't as embarrassed as he thought he'd be going down the stairs wearing the Muskateer outfit complete with feathered hat and twirly mustache. Nobody even gave them more than a second glance. Well, no one gave Remus and Peter a second glance. James and Sirius who were being very noisy and swishing their fake swords around definitely got quite a few glances and eye rolls."And what are you supposed to be?"The boys whirled around to find three sixties gals watching them with interest. Lily, Inkwood, and Colgate were all decked out as hippies complete with flower face paint."The four Muskateers, of course," James said, brandishing his sword. Colgate jerked back nervously as the tip came within inches of her face. "It's okay, it's fake.""It could still hurt!" she snapped."Isn't it the Three Muskateers?" Inkwood asked."That's what it's called, but there's also d'Artagnan." James put his hands on his hips. "That's me."Lily covered her mouth in amusement. "I'm surprised you even know what you're talking about. Unless of course you're just parroting Remus.""Least we're cooler than you guys," James grumbled, ignoring completely the fact that half his wardrobe consisted of the 60s hippie style.Lily rolled her eyes at Remus who gave a helpless shrug. "That's your comeback?" she asked James, knowing perfectly well what he wore on the weekends.James narrowed his eyes but Remus didn't want any fighting today so he stepped forward and said, "You've got t-to admit, swords are p-pretty neat.""Yeah, on Black the whole look works," Inkwood said, glancing Sirius up and down. Sirius grinned and struck a pose causing Inkwood to giggle. "You like my outfit?" She gave a spin to show her tie-dyed outfit off at all angles."You look good in bright colors like that," Sirius replied.Lily and Colgate began giggling too and Inkwood's eyes shone. "Thank you," Inkwood said in a strange voice and Remus had no idea why the air seemed so different but it did.James looked a little annoyed. "Right, anyway, come on guys, it's lunchtime." He grabbed Sirius and pulled him away from the girls with Remus and Peter quickly following, leaving the giggling girls behind. He heard Colgate whisper something about Sirius to Inkwood but he didn't quite catch everything.Most the rest of the school had been in costume for most the morning. There were quite a few who weren't, and most the first years were just in their uniform. Spinnet and Struthers had changed into very traditional, old-fashioned wizarding fashion with huge pointy hats that Sirius declared to be 'boring'."I've got robes like that in my wardrobe, not much of a costume," he said as they sat down. "Only mine look much better."The only teacher dressed in costume was Professor Prewett. He came into the Great Hall in head to toe pirate gear, also with a fake sword."Okay, he's definitely the coolest teacher we've ever had," James said as all four of them watched him go up to the High Table, not bothered at all by the fact none of his peers were in fancy dress."Forgiven him for calling you flashy, have you?" Remus teased.James stuck his tongue out but then smiled. "Yeah, mostly. I mean, obviously I'm very good at dueling so I dunno why my stance is that important but that's just something Prewett and I won't ever agree on.""Stance is important though," Remus muttered not that any of them paid much attention to what he said. He wished they would, wished they look at him—look at him—and talk to him every single minute from now until the next night. He wanted a million memories to take home with him, to keep him through the rest of his lifetime.His nose itched, and he clenched his teeth, determined not to cry.Once they finished eating, the second year Gryffindors headed to Defense Against the Dark Arts where Prewett was already waiting, a sneaky sort of smile on his face as he leaned back against his desk. He waited until everyone took their seats and then he stood up. "Everyone looks great," he said, beaming at all thirteen students in costume. Magpie and Nettle were dressed as a cat and an owl respectively, McNab was in super fancy robes and red wig that he later found out was supposed to represent Ginger Windstorm, the lead singer of the Hufflepuffskeins, and Twycross was in ancient looking robes and a horn-like hat, and was apparently supposed to be Silphyana Hedgeburst, a famous witch from nearly back in the Hogwarts founding days.Prewett turned back to his desk and then held up a small treasure chest. "I decided that today should be a fun class." James and Sirius perked up in excitement. "The first thing is... a surprise quiz." James and Sirius slumped down, groaning. Prewett seemed very amused as he opened the chest, pulling out a stack of papers. He waved them to everyone's desks with his wand and then shut the chest with a snap. "After we finish these, the fun part will be revealed."The test was super easy. There were five questions, all of them pretty simple and straightforward. Remus got through them in only a few minutes, and in fact Prewett only gave them ten minutes total. Once he collected the papers he picked up the chest again."We're going to have a treasure hunt," he said, smiling broadly. "I'm going to pair everyone up into teams of two except one team will have three partners, but that team will have the most difficult one. In order to make this a little fun..." He opened the chest and pulled out a small slip of paper. "I've got all your names in here." Immediately everyone groaned, knowing they wouldn't be able to pick their partners; it'd all be random. "Come on now," Prewett said, shaking his head. "It won't be all that bad." He looked at the slip in his hand. "Magpie with..." He rooted around in the chest. "Struthers."Magpie and Struthers exchanged glances. It wasn't all that bad for them.Prewett pulled two more slips. "Inkwood with Twycross."Inkwood made a face.Two more names. "Lupin..." Remus sat up a bit straighter, crossing his fingers under the desk. "With Pettigrew."He and Peter grinned at each other and gave low fives."Potter... with... Evans.""No!" they both shouted at the same time then looked absolutely horrified.Lily's hand shot up. "Professor please redraw a partner name for me! Or—or I can be with Remus and Pettigrew as the team of three?"Prewett gave her a look. "We must obey the pirate's chest, Miss Evans," he said, patting the bejeweled case. "Mr. Potter, please refrain from attempting to impale yourself on your sword."James, who had the tip of his sword pointed at his heart, scowled and angrily shoved it back into his sheath. "I'll give you five galleons to pick me a new partner," he said. There were snickers and Lily's face went red. Prewett rolled his eyes and pulled two more slips. "Ten galleons."Prewett continued to ignore him. "McNab with Nettle."Sirius let out a very loud moan and began banging his face against the desk. Remus wasn't quite sure why until he realized—"That means our trio consists of Mr. Black, Miss Colgate, and Mr. Spinnet."Sirius and Spinnet looked positively murderous. Colgate shifted in her seat, clearly uncomfortable with this but she didn't say anything."Right!" Prewett snapped the case shut and set it down. "Here's how it's going to go. I've hidden several cases around the school—pirate chests, just like this one—and you'll be given a clue to your first one. Each clue gets progressively harder. There are ten clues for each team except the trio, you have fifteen..."He explained they'd be given the first one along with a list which would have additional help for future clues depending on their test results. Each correct answer to a question was an extra clue. He gave the example of the regular clue might be at the Astronomy tower and their extra clue would be the letter A, or it might be a quote that helped expand the main clue. Their final location would hold the 'winning ticket' and the first one back with the ticket would get a prize."At least we'll have five clues from you," Peter muttered."I'm sure we'll have more," Remus said, having faith in Peter.Prewett called the students up in the same order that he read their names so they were third. "Eight additional clues," he said and Remus nudged Peter happily. Peter looked pleased. "Good luck boys," he said, handing them their first clue and a list of eight hints. They were also given a key that would only open the correct chests, so they wouldn't be able to open anyone else's chest.Most the other groups got eight to ten clues, and then the trio got eleven clues. Spinnet narrowed his eyes. "Only eleven? Not fifteen?""Yes," Prewett said, handing them their list and key. "Mr. Black didn't answer a single question and instead opted to draw a caricature of me manning a pirate ship. While not the correct answers, I am awarding him one point for creativity. Okay kids, good luck! If you're still wandering around by 2:45 consider class ended and you may go.""So potentially we can just go chill out in our common room?" Sirius asked.Prewett looked like he wanted to make Sirius walk the plank. "Yes," he reluctantly said. "Though the prize is worth it. I suppose I should tell you." He went over to his desk, pulling out two small pirate chests and opened them revealing an array of Honeydukes sweets. "There's a third, if the trio is back first. Plus whoever is back first will automatically get an O. Everyone else who returns will get graded depending on how many clues they've solved. These grades are considered extra credit, so if you do not come back you won't have anything negative added to your overall grades, but if you do return you'll have positive added. Good luck, may the best pirate win."Peter grabbed Remus. "Sweets!" he hissed out."We're going to win," Remus said, eyeing the chocolate."Nobody get between Remus and his chocolate," joked James.Remus shot him a smile then left the classroom, walking away from the other knots of students so he and Peter could have some privacy. "All right let's see..." He unfurled the first clue. "You'd do best to cover your ears if you encounter these tears," he read."Moaning Myrtle?" Peter suggested."Mandrakes, greenhouse three," Remus said, tucking the clue away then glanced at the extra one they got. "When daisies pied and violets blue, and lady-smocks all silver-white.""What!?" Peter stared at the quote. "That's even weirder than our first clue!"Remus just started walking. "It's Shakespeare."Peter hurried after him. "I thought the extra stuff was supposed to help!""It just means go where there are plants.""Ugh, I am so glad I'm with you!"Remus grabbed his hand. "Come on." He began running, pulling Peter behind him. They slowed whenever Remus heard anyone approaching and then sped across the grounds. They found three chests outside of Greenhouse Three along with a note that said 'Defense Against The Dark Arts: do not touch unless otherwise told!'. Peter crouched down, trying the key with the first chest then the second one which popped open."This is easy," he said, standing back up."It'll get harder," Remus said and unrolled the clue. "Lapifors," he said.Peter threw his hands in the air. "Your guess is as good as—""Transfiguration," Remus said, smiling at Peter. "'Fors' is a common suffix for transfiguration, remember?""No," Peter grouched. "What's lapifors?""No idea, we haven't done it yet, but the 'fors' gives it away," Remus said, shoving the clue in his pocket and looking at the extra clue. "'You know this teacher best of all'," he read."Yeah, good ol' McGonsie," Peter said then began running to keep up with Remus.They reached the Transfiguration classroom to find James and Lily standing across from it, arguing furiously with one another. There were three chests, one of them open. Remus and Peter slowed down, watching the two of them try to remain quiet as they snarled back and forth."I'm telling you, it's the east courtyard!" Lily said, stomping her foot.James pulled the slip of paper out of her hand. "No it's not! It's the western courtyard!"Remus raised his eyebrows and edged closer to the chests. Normally he'd try to alleviate the argument but they were competition. James and Lily stopped when they realized they weren't alone."Remus, which courtyard has the big oak tree?" James asked."The northern courtyard," Remus said."No it doesn't, it has the birches," Lily said. Remus shrugged as Peter tried to find their chest. "You're trying to send us off in the wrong direction!" she accused.Remus grinned now while James snorted. "Told you, him and chocolate... it's dangerous."Peter straightened up and handed Remus the clue. "Is this your second stop?" he asked."No... our first," Lily said."That's because Red here won't listen to me," James said, folding his arms."You're just wanting to argue instead of looking!" Lily pointed out then looked back at the other two. "Are you on your second?""Yes," Peter said proudly."That's cause you got paired with someone actually nice!" James snapped and Peter stuck his tongue out. "If Brains and I were on a team we'd probably be done! Say, Prewett didn't say it'd be against the rules to change teammates did he?"Lily smacked him upside the back of his head. "We'd get in trouble, idiot! Now come on, the eastern courtyard." She took hold of his sleeve and dragged him off."Western!" he insisted.Remus and Peter both snickered then Remus looked at the clue and immediately gave a loud burst of laughter. He collapsed down onto the bench, shoving the paper at Peter who also began laughing too. "Your classmates Mr. Potter and Mr. Black know this chamber very well and spend more time here than anyone else!" Remus gasped out, slapping his thigh.They looked at each other and at the same time said, "Detention chamber!"They got up, heading off, hoping that James or Sirius would get this clue too. Either way, he was keeping it and if he somehow was able to stay at Hogwarts he was going to stick it up on the wall in their dorm. Outside the detention chamber were four chests—one of them already open—and got their clue which led them to the third floor, to the state of Gunhilda de Gorsemoor. Two chests—neither opened—were at the feet of the one-eyed, humped-back witch. That clue sent them to the Charms corridor where they saw four chests, two open."You wouldn't be able to get through the day without this room existing," he read the clue then frowned. "Our first real puzzle. The Gryffindor common room? The main staircase, perhaps?"Peter scratched his head. "The kitchens? Food is important.""Or the Great Hall." Remus got the list of extra clues out. "South Wales Valleys," he read slowly."You're Welsh, what's that mean?" Pete asked, peering over his shoulder."I—I'm not sure actually," he said slowly. "There's Cardiff... Swansea..." He looked at the clues again. "Important room. Valleys."Peter sat down on the bench near the chests. "Yeah, it's getting harder."Remus sat down as well, staring at the two clues. A moment later Magpie and Struthers showed up. Magpie smiled at Remus when he glanced up, and Remus wondered how many clues they had gotten. He returned to studying the clue, trying to ignore the other two whispering about their clue (which would send them to the Great Hall, he knew immediately) until he realized what theirs meant and grinned. "Petey, you were right.""I was?"Remus jumped up and began going as fast as he dared with Peter following. Once they were far enough away from the other team Remus said, "Kitchens!""How do you know?"Remus looked over his shoulder. "Helga Hufflepuff is from the south valleys! Hufflepuff is by the kitchens.""Ha! I got it right!"The clue outside the kitchens led them to the eastern courtyard (which did have the big oak, Lily was right), and that clue sent them to Hagrid's hut. They only had two clues left, and they wouldn't have any extra hints left. Peter apologized when Remus mentioned this and he just shrugged in response. It wasn't that big of a deal. They were making great time, and his biggest competition would probably be Lily who was bogged down with her hatred of James. Twycross might be doing well too, though."More Shakespeare," Remus said appreciatively. "We don't need an extra clue for this one! 'Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck, and yet methinks I have blank'.""Have blank?" Pete asked."It means the final word in the clue is what we're needing, and the answer is astronomy. It's Sonnet... um... fourteen I think, or maybe fifteen.""Thank Merlin you know Shakespeare!" Peter said, puffing a little as they went up more stairs, Remus tripping over some of them. "Maybe Prewett knows my grandpa because this sort of trek up and down and up and down is definitely the craziness he'd do."At the base of the stairs to the Astronomy tower were six chests. Everyone had a clue bringing them here. Two of them were already open, and it took a moment for Peter to find theirs. He handed Remus the clue, their final one.Remus wiped sweat off his forehead and then examined the last clue. "Strigiformes," he said then turned the clue over in case there was more."Another spell?" Pete asked, sitting down on the floor, fanning himself. His mustache was very lopsided."It's not one I recognize," Remus said, sitting down next to him. "Strigiformes... strigiformes. It sounds familiar." It nagged at his brain cause he knew he should know it. It was very familiar but he couldn't really place why. It was definitely Latin... ooh he knew he knew what it meant but it wasn't coming to the front of his brain."Forms?" Peter adjusted his mustache. "More Transfiguration? Or maybe it means the training dummies, maybe it's back at Defense.""Library," Remus said, getting back up after a minute."It's the library?""No, we need to go to the library."Sirius, Colgate, and Spinnet were outside the library, Sirius and Spinnet shouting while Colgate stood with her hands over her ears looking desperate. There were three chests nearby."Remy!" Sirius said brightly, switching from 10 to 0 with the anger level instantly. He ran over and threw an arm around him. "How is your hunt going? Ours is going just peachy."Spinnet folded his arms, glowering. "I'm just about to give up.""You do that," Sirius said then wriggled Remus's hat so it tousled his hair.Remus ducked away, fixing his hat. "Ours is g-going well," he said."Yeah, we're at—" Peter began and Remus clamped his hand over his mouth. "—mmmph!"Sirius snorted. "All right, keep your secrets then. Not that it matters. We're definitely going to lose. Wait, all three of these chests are open so what are you doing here?""Research," Remus replied.Sirius's eyes bugged out a little. "You need to do research?""Yes... we only had eight extra clues, not ten, and the—" He quickly stopped, clamping his mouth shut."Ooh-ho-ho!" Sirius exclaimed, clapping his hands. "So you're on your ninth or tenth clue, then!""Merlin," Spinnet muttered. "We're definitely going to lose.""Maybe if you two didn't argue and try to strangle each other every five seconds!" Colgate said, wrapping her arms around herself and looking at Remus with such a pitiful look he felt very bad for her. Mostly. After all... competition."Oh by the way..." Sirius showed Remus the clue that had led them to the library which was 'Most evenings your classmates Miss Evans and Mr. Lupin are here'. Remus blushed a little that he was a clue! He later found out everyone had a clue assigned to them in some form, directing them to a place the student liked to be. Peter's clue which had been gotten by Inkwood and Twycross had been to the photography rooms, while Inkwood's apparently sent the person to the Quidditch pitch; Remus was glad he hadn't gotten that one since he had no idea Inkwood liked Quidditch. He was very glad they had gotten James and Sirius's names!Remus and Peter wished the trio good luck then went into the library. "How are we gonna do this?" Peter whispered as Remus tugged him down an aisle."Index," Remus replied, pulling out a massive Transfiguration book then down the Charms aisle, getting out a couple of those. He dragged Pete to a table then gave him one of the Charms ones. "Look in the index, try to find the spell or anything very similar and we can go from there." He opened one of the Charms books and began running his finger down the S part of the index. Nothing. He pushed the book away and grabbed the third Charms book. Nothing."You are fast," Peter said, blushing as he was still going through the S's in his."It's fine," Remus said encouragingly. "Just keep looking."He grabbed the Transfiguration book and went through. "Aha! Strigifors.""Fors means Transfiguration!" Peter said brightly as Remus flipped through the book. "But strigifors isn't what we need, is it?""No, but it will help point us in the right direction. Here we go... strigifors... turns an object into an owl," he read then shut the book. "Strigiformes! The Latin term for owls."Outside the owlery were three chests, two of them open. Peter opened the third and then shrieked, bouncing up and down, waving a piece of parchment that said Return To Prewett!Remus grabbed his hand again and they ran as fast as they could. Remus fell three times before they got there, bursting into the classroom. Prewett was sitting at his desk with his feet propped up, a magazine open. He flailed a bit when they came in and jammed the magazine into a drawer, his ears going red; he obviously hadn't expected anyone back so soon."That was quick!" he said as Peter handed him the winning ticket. "You're the first back. You won!"Peter and Remus beamed at each other and then hugged tightly, laughing as they spun in a circle, Peter lifting Remus off the ground. It felt great!"My first O!" Peter realized, staggering back, staring at Remus with a dropped jaw. "R-right? I get an O?" he asked Prewett who nodded. "Merlin!" He stumbled then went to the nearest seat to plop down."What d-d-does this have to do with Defense, though?" Remus asked as Prewett got out their prizes."Nothing," Prewett chuckled, handing him one of them and giving the other to Peter. "But it was exciting, wasn't it? You can wait if you like, or go."They were both curious to see who came in second so they opted to wait, taking their hats off so they could fan themselves as they sorted their their sweets. There was quite a bit, and Remus was immensely happy.Fifteen minutes later the door opened and Lily ran in. "We're back!" she squealed, slapping the parchment on the desk.James came jogging in behind her, glancing over at his waiting friends who waved merrily at their fellow Muskateer. "Yeah, too late," James said and Lily turned, her smile fading."I should have known!" she sighed, but didn't sound angry.Remus looked at the two of them. "You probably would have beaten us if you didn't argue the entire time."Both of them glowered, and he tried not to look too amused.They both got Os for getting all their clues (though they did have all ten extra clues so...) then sat with Remus and Peter, comparing their clues with one another. Most of theirs were pretty easy, a few were confusing. James laughed hard at the one directing Remus and Peter to detention hall, wanting a copy of it.A bit later Twycross and Inkwood came in, also getting Os. They didn't stay. Then it was getting close to when classes ended and the other teams trailed in. Struthers and Magpie got nine of theirs, and Es. Nettle and McNab got eight and Es as well, and Sirius, Colgate, and Struthers got eleven clues, and As. But Prewett promised this excursion was basically like extra credit so the A only added to their grades and didn't drag the overall down. He dismissed class and everyone who remained left, James and Sirius congratulating Remus and Peter."Congratulate us all you want, I'm not sharing," Peter said, and they all laughed.James put an arm around Sirius. "Well, after that maddening exercise we've got a bigger task ahead of us!"They shared identical, mischievous grins. It was time to don the invisibility cloak, and sneak the babbling brew into the kitchens.

Remus and Peter had nothing to do besides hold their friends' hats and swords. They weren't actively participating in getting this prank underway, as per Remus's idea. They didn't need to distract the house-elves and being present in the kitchens before this babbling prank would be detrimental so they hung out in the entrance hall, watching some older students who must have had Defense since they were doing a treasure hunt too. There were new chests sitting along the edge of the entrance hall, and two students trying to figure out their clue. It was a tough one, though Remus suspected it might be near the teachers' lounge."Prewett is super cool," Pete said as they watched the two Hufflepuffs. "I mean, a treasure hunt!""Yes," Remus agreed, drawing his feet up onto the bench, wrapping his arms around his legs. "I love our prizes.""I'm so glad I got teamed with you," Pete said, nudging Remus who smiled back.Soon they began playing wand-cauldron-book to pass the time until they heard James's whisper to go to the nearest bathroom. They jumped up, hurrying off and then opening the stalls to make sure they were alone. James took the cloak off, him and Sirius hardly able to speak with how much they were trying not to laugh."It went completely smooth," Sirius said, taking his hat from Peter. "We got it in several different sauces and gravies, several of the big jugs of pumpkin juice, most the soups, and some of the desserts."James wrapped the belt and sheath around his waist, rebuckling it. "It's going to be great. I can't wait, can the feast get here now? Why do we have to wait hours?"Sirius smoothed down his curly mustache. "What shall we do until then? Find some people to jinx?""Lets go to Fort Dragon," Remus suggested suddenly."Nah, we'd get these costumes too dirty," James said, dismissing the suggestion.Remus tried not to look too disappointed, nodding in agreement. Maybe the weather would be nice enough to let them go tomorrow morning or afternoon.They wound up wandering around the corridors—mostly to show off their costumes—with James and Sirius occasionally sending tripping jinxes to various students. They were too eager about the babbling brew to do more than small, quick little 'pranks'. At one point they came across some unopened chests for whatever treasure hunt Prewett was conducting and James and Sirius tried to break into them to no avail. They begged Remus to try, insisting he could, but Remus refused."You think I can get past a Defense teacher's defenses?" he demanded. "You're crazy.""If anyone could it'd be you," James wheedled but Remus shook his head. "Fiiiine."They had a mock sword fight down one corridor complete with dramatic, over-the-top deaths when one was stabbed. James crashed into a suit of armor sending some pieces of it flying and they quickly ran away before they could get in trouble. Shortly after they crossed paths with some first year Slytherins including Regulus. The other first years sneered at the Gryffindors and walked away but Regulus hesitated until they were out of ear shot, then greeted Sirius, curious about their costumes."I've never heard of that," Regulus said when Sirius explained. "Three Muskateers?""It's M-Muggle," Remus said.Regulus looked startled at that, then stared at Sirius as if he had turned into some sort of unknown being. "Mu... ggle?"Sirius kept his smile plastered on his face. "Yup."Regulus swallowed. "Oh," was all he said, shifting from foot to foot awkwardly now."They're not unknown in the Wizarding world," James said helpfully. "I've heard of them. I don't know much. But I've heard of them."Regulus opened his mouth then shut it. "Er, yes, well." He tugged at his uniform tie then turned back to Sirius. "I'll see you later." He turned and walked off."Hey!" Sirius said and Regulus hesitated, glancing over his shoulder, nervous. "Have a good Halloween."Regulus smiled. "You too." And he ran off to find his friends./\/\/\/\/\After an eternity it was time for the Halloween feast. The Marauders made sure their costumes were in good condition (Peter had to readjust his mustache which had somehow slipped across one cheek) then they burst into the mostly empty Great Hall, finding seats. The Great Hall was decked out as usual. Like the previous year there great spiderwebs everywhere with fake spiders in them, and orange and black streamers. This year there were also enchanted skeletons dancing around the edges of the room, bats swooping around, four enormous pumpkins sat in the corners, and instead of regular pumpkins floating around, the pumpkins were differently colored. There were gold ones giving off red light, bronze giving off blue, black giving off yellow, and silver giving off green. There also seemed to be an excessive amount of ghosts which was explained when Dumbledore started the feast off by having a group of ghosts float near the front of the room singing for a while. Finally, though, the food appeared across the tables.Remus just wanted to sit back and watch everyone fall under the effects of the babbling brew but that'd be too suspicious so he began piling food on his plate. Sirius and Peter did as well, and Sirius had to nudge James before James got his own food. His eyes were shining and he and Sirius kept snickering, waiting.Remus scooped up some roasted potatoes with gravy over them, knowing the gravy held the brew. He hesitated then put the potatoes in his mouth. Just as he did he began to hear some startled, nonsensical cries."Jeblle dwallo oobie?!""Heelbor doot doot!"There didn't seem to be many students at first but then it spread as kids began eating, then stopping when they tried to converse with their friends and were unable to. James bent his head over his food, shoulders shaking. Sirius jammed half a chicken drumstick into his mouth to stop himself from laughing. Peter's lips were pressed tightly and he was just giving quiet snorts."What's going on?""Vamma gliboa!""What are you saying?!"It was becoming chaos. Everyone grew louder, sounding more and more panicked. Remus had to cover his ears as the din grew louder, trying not to show how much pain he was in. He had done this before, but now his friends' smiles faded as they realized what was going on with him. Sirius's pale brow was wrinkled and James was giving him an apologetic look. Remus smiled, shrugging."What happened?""Clamma dulbop!"Hardly anyone was eating by this point. Everyone who couldn't speak were letting out long strings of nonsense while their friends looked on in concern. The teachers had picked up on what was going on, and Remus judged that three of them were babbling, going by their faces; Sprout, Spring, and Prewett. McGonagall was leaning in to whisper in Dumbledore's ear but Dumbledore didn't seem too concerned."OLLWAT URBGUNK TIPLAR HOUNK!" The Head Boy had stood up at the Hufflepuff table, slamming his hands on the table, shouting at the teachers' table.Two third years sitting near the Marauders turned to look at them. "Ummle jooble?!" one of them demanded, grabbing Sirius's arm."Loowlie donnga hep?" Sirius replied, giving a shrug. Then he pretended to look shocked, fingers going to his lips. "Imly erwack!" He turned to James, pointing at his mouth. "Imly erwack!""Asanla digby doobem?" James asked. He dropped his fork and covered his mouth. They looked very convincing which was good because McGonagall was coming right for them. Remus was a little surprised it had taken so long."Danble chorna?" she demanded, and several students fell silent seeing her standing over the Marauders who were trying not to laugh at their strict, stern professor babbling nonsense. Remus heard someone say 'should have known'.James turned a distressed face to her. "Wabba jammloob? Quiblim danhor, ell waan molombia!"McGonagall's eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Infor? Ashklow diba ta jabnick.""Shamba na heper durb," Sirius replied, shaking his head.Loud fireworks went off at the High Table and almost the whole room quieted, everyone looking up at Dumbledore who was lowering his wand. "Antment delkin frabanage," he said, waving his arm towards Professor Slughorn who got to his feet with some difficulty."A-hem," he said then cleared his throat, using a spell to make himself louder. "It seems as though someone has put the Babbling Brew into the food." At that more than a few accusing glares were sent to the Marauders. "Do not worry, it has no adverse affects and as far as I can tell it was brewed to perfection."Remus could feel Sirius kicking at James's foot under the table then at Peter. They were trying not to look proud."It should wear off of you after five to ten minutes after ingesting the food. However if you continue to eat the food with the Brew in it, it won't be until you stop before the Babbling Brew stops affecting you. As unfortunately we cannot tell which foods has the Brew in it and which ones don't, it seems we'll have to deal with the potion if we wish to enjoy this delicious food." With that he sat down and took a great big bite of food.McGonagall glared at James and Sirius then swept up back to the High Table. Dumbledore said something to her and she shook her head. Once Dumbledore began eating again that seemed to be a signal, and everyone returned to their food. Students continued to attempt to talk and as they ate the 'tainted' food their English turned to babbling, and occasionally the babbling would return to English.Lily appeared at his elbow. "Leepdoo hurple gap!" she said, folding her arms as she scowled at James and Sirius. She then looked at Remus and gestured at the food. It was clear what she meant: did you do this?Remus widened his eyes and shook his head. "Oombel dagdag," he replied.Lily gave a very huffy sigh, then stormed back to her friends. James, Sirius, and Peter all snickered. They returned to their own food, unable to carry on a conversation since they were all babbling. That seemed to be the theme of the entire Great Hall. It was actually quieter than it had been the previous Halloween, and quieter than the other feasts. Remus thought it was a little nice.Dessert appeared and everyone plunged into this, cautiously testing out their words. Some of them did return to normal, others continued babbling. Remus ate a humongous piece of chocolate cake which he knew perfectly well was full of the Brew but he didn't care. Chocolate cake was chocolate cake.Finally at the end of the feast Dumbledore stood up. "Walmer er. Sul dora balntoo piplop." He smiled brightly then sat back down, wiping his fingers off and pushing his bowl away."Gleborp toopoot," James said as the Marauders got up."Are we going to our dorm?" Sirius asked. He had purposely eaten the pumpkin pie so he could speak again.James's eyes glinted mischievously and he nodded. "Urp relpa boosha bebble," he said, glancing over towards Spinnet and Struthers.Remus looked at James then Sirius, realizing something was up, something they hadn't shared. Did they have something else planned? It was pointless to try to ask until the potion faded, so he just followed them out of the Great Hall, unsure whether Pete knew about whatever it was. As they passed other students they'd be verbally attacked. Mostly with babbling, but a few people could speak English and they blamed James and Sirius, a few of the other houses thanking them because it meant Gryffindor would be even further behind with points. James and Sirius rolled their eyes and stuck their noses in the air, ignoring the glibs.By the time they got to their dorm, James, Peter, and Remus could all speak normally once more. "Is something going on?" Remus asked as soon as the door shut."Of course," James said as he took his hat and mustache off."And... what would that be?"James opened his mouth but then the door opened, Spinnet and Struthers coming in. James quickly shut his mouth, smiling innocently."Why do you two have to ruin everything?!" Spinnet demanded as he took off his giant hat. "The feast is important, and you two go and make it into a total mess!""I thought dinner was lovely," James said. "Delicious."Spinnet growled. "I hate you. And you," he added to Sirius just in case for some reason he had forgotten Spinnet's enmity. "You're both absolute jerks and I hope you get expelled!" He cast glares at Peter and Remus. "And you two just egg them on!""Yeah, yeah," sighed Sirius. "We're terrible human beings, we get the point. Do you have anything new to say or is that it?"Spinnet's nostrils flared but he just grabbed his stuff to get a shower, stomping back out of the room. Remus got clean pajamas and withdrew to the bathroom to change and as soon as he went in Spinnet started shouting at him, calling him an idiot. Remus cringed back and Spinnet quickly stopped."Ahhh. Lupin, sorry, thought you were one of them," he said, face twisting up. "If I knew it was you—""You'd p-probably just st—start complaining about th-them," Remus finished for him, creeping past him.Spinnet watched him a little angrily then groaned. "You guys did ruin the feast.""Yes, all that d-destroyed f-food." Remus rolled his eyes. "What a waste.""Fine, be as much of a little shit as your friends." Remus went into one of the shower stalls, closing the curtain with a yank. "You know, pranks are only funny if everyone's laughing," Spinnet continued talking. Remus said nothing, just got out of his costume and into his pajamas as quickly as possible. He didn't want to deal with Spinnet right now, not on his last night here! "Hardly anything you lot do are pranks, they're just bullying.""Like st—stealing journals?" Remus asked.Silence. Then, "Whatever, Loopy." He heard Spinnet go to the other side of the room, grumbling to himself.Remus finished getting into his pajamas then went to the sink tipping some of the teeth cleaning potion into his mouth. He swirled it around then brushed to make sure it got everywhere, staring at his reflection. He wondered how others saw him. Not the Marauders, but people like Spinnet. Did they really think he was crazy? What would they say when he left?He spat the potion out the rinsed the rest out. I've gone to Saint Mungo's, he thought, looking back up at the mirror. That's what they're going to say. He wondered what the Marauders would say. After his secret was erased from their memories. Would they think he was too sick? Or would they think he was crazy? James thought he was, for a little while; maybe he'd go back to that.A sharp pain stabbed into his chest at that thought. Of James living his life thinking, Oh, right Lupin, we were friends for a while but he's a nutcase. He wished they didn't have to lose this. He wished Sirius wouldn't have to go through this. How much would he fight Dumbledore?Shaking his head, he returned to the dorm. Halloween music was playing out of the radio and all three of his friends were in their pajamas already. Peter grinned seeing Remus, motioning for him to come over to play cards. Remus slid into James's bed, sitting in his usual spot, taking the cards James dealt him, not really seeing the pictures or numbers."Okay, so what are we doing that's got you two all excited?" Peter asked.James glared at him then closed the curtains. "Shh, Struthers is still in here!" he whispered.Peter covered his mouth. "Oooh, sorry.""We are doing something else?" Remus asked, organizing his cards as best he could."Of course," Sirius said with a wicked grin. "It's... well, we think it's really important to do...""But what is it?" Pete asked, annoyed.James and Sirius looked at one another then at the curtains. "Think they'll go to bed early enough?" James asked.Sirius shrugged. "We should've gotten some sleep potion from the hospital wing."At that Remus dropped the cards. "What?!" he hissed out. "Are you—" He stopped, realizing he was about to use the same word floating around his mind about himself."Serious?" Sirius asked with a twinkling eye. "Always."Remus groaned and smacked his arm lightly. "An idiot, is what I was going to say, and the answer to that is always." Sirius stuck his tongue out.James touched his finger to his lips as Spinnet came back in the dorm. "We'll have to wait a while before we can do this. Besides, it needs to be close to midnight."For some reason Remus thought back to their desire to go to his Hogsmeade house, to listen to the screams. "We're not sneaking out anywhere, are we?"James and Sirius looked at each other once again. "Um, maybe," Sirius said.Remus's heart leapt into his throat. "Where?""Outside," James said quietly."Where outside?" he pressed."Just into the mountains," replied Sirius, which eased Remus's fears but he still wasn't sure what was going on. "Look, wait till they're asleep then we can go. For now..." he slapped down his cards triumphantly. "I win."/\/\/\/\/\A few hours later they were outside.It had taken... a lot of wheedling and pleading from James and Sirius to convince Remus. At first he flat out refused. Then he told them it was a bad idea. Then they kept begging, saying it was important although wouldn't tell him why it was important. He asked again where they were going and they promised just in the mountains behind Hogwarts. In the end he went with them, figuring it didn't matter if he was caught. He'd be home before any punishment could be done.The four of them crept to the second floor where there was a tunnel that led to a cave nearby. They were pretty sure Filch knew about it however they doubted anyone would be watching it this late. They wound their way through the twists and turns and came out in a cave in the mountains. Remus felt goosebumps rising as they stepped out into the mouth of the cave, looking at the school in the dim light that the crescent moon cast.One by one they sat down in the dirt, shivering in the very cold night air. James spread the invisibility cloak out around them so they were all wrapped up in it, huddled. James on one end, Sirius on the other, Pete and Remus squished between them. Sirius was very warm which was nice. They just watched the sky for a moment until finally James spoke up."I want to do something. For Remus.""Me?"James pulled the cloak away from them and folded it up, setting it off to the side out of the way. Then he pulled the small bag off his shoulder. He had brought it with him, not telling any of them what was in it; Remus had assumed it held sweets. To his shock James pulled out a knife."Good God, James!" Pete gasped, shrinking away from him, into Remus."Why d-d-do you have that?!" Remus asked, beginning to tremble."A week ago James told you we'd take oaths to show you how much we mean to protect you," Sirius said, looking right into Remus's face. "We mean it."Remus's heart dropped somehow past his feet and through the ground. What?James grinned. "How perfect to do this on All Hallows Eve?" He shifted his weight, getting onto his knees."A—a blood oath?" Remus asked, feeling completely thrown for a loop... like one of them had just chucked him off the cliff. He felt dizzy, like he was falling fast. Panic swelled up, pushing at his skin."Sirius and I are both willing," James said then pinned Peter with his gaze. "How about you?"Peter gave a faint squeak. "Ah... um...""No," Remus said, putting an arm automatically around him. "Don't you suck him into this. Blood oaths are d-dangerous, do you have any idea—""Not a real blood oath!" laughed Sirius, getting onto his knees as well. "Not with our wands, or magic. We're not even stupid enough to tamper with that!"Remus still felt on edge. "It's one of the most powerful nights of the year, you might not even need your wand," he said, feeling as though something or someone was watching them."Pete, you in?" James asked, holding the knife out, ignoring Remus completely.Peter was staring hard at the knife. "I... I...""Come on," Sirius pressed. "It's for Remus.""Don't," Remus snarled. "Don't you use me as an excuse to do something absolutely bonkers!"Peter looked at Remus then back at James. "Okay.""Pete, don't," Remus begged. He didn't want his friends slicing themselves up to prove some stupid point that wouldn't even matter in less than twenty-four hours! "If this is for me, don't I get a say in this?" James cocked his head, knife poised in the air. This was so wrong. So bizarre! It couldn't be happening. He had been plunged into some sort of horrible nightmare. How in Merlin's name did they reach the decision to do this?! "Please don't. It's stupid."Sirius gave him a wry smile. "That's what we're good at. Being stupid.""You three are actually considering cutting yourselves up to do something so—so arbitrary?!""What's that mean?" Peter asked.Remus scowled. "Senseless. Pointless. Irrational!""I read a Muggle book once where the group of friends cut their hands to make a blood pact about something," Peter said, rubbing the back of his head. "If Muggles can do it, what's so wrong with us doing it?""Muggles aren't magic," Remus hissed out. "Nor are they doing it at such a powerful location—" he jabbed a finger towards the castle, "—and on All Hallows Eve!"Sirius snorted. "If we don't do it now, we'll just do it another time and you'll be arguing it then too."Remus pushed his hair back, feeling furious that they had done this to him, that they were doing this when he was about to leave. Not that they knew that, how little hope he had for the next day, but still. Course even if he wasn't leaving he wouldn't want them to do it. "Look. Let's wait till Friday night. You can do it Friday night.""What's so special about Friday?" James asked."It's my birthday," Sirius said.Remus frowned, having completely forgotten that. "Or the weekend, when it's a new moon. That would be neat to do, wouldn't it? A blood oath under no moon? Mean a lot more to me, too."James sank back down against his heels, lowering his arm finally. "Might be cool to do on a new moon," he mused.Remus nodded eagerly. "Yes. I would prefer that." He looked back and forth, hoping his pleas would get to them.He could see it on their faces that they were considering it. Then James noticed the time on his watch—a couple minutes before midnight—and shook his head, rising back up onto his knees. "No, tonight is perfect. Okay!"Remus groaned loudly, hands covering his eyes, considering trying to take the knife from James and throwing it over the edge. He would have screamed with rage if he wasn't worried it might carry to the school and somehow someone would hear it. What on earth had possessed James and Sirius to think this was even vaguely a good idea?!"We are more than just friends," James spoke in a grave, serious voice. "We are the Marauders, and our bond goes... um... beyond friendship? Oh!" he gasped as the wind kicked up pretty hard right then which Remus thought was a bad omen. "Hah, perfect! We are, uhhh, gathered here tonight to show the strength of, um, our—our ties. Our... solidity to our dear friend, Remus Lupin. He's our friend, and—er—""Really should have written this before," Sirius whispered.James glared. "He's our friend, and no matter what we will be there for him. I, James Potter, do solemnly swear to keep this oath, and protect Remus's secret." James hissed as the blade cut into his palm.His blood splattered on the dirt, droplets falling as he passed the knife to Sirius. Remus could smell it, and it made the creepy feeling even more intense. He wanted to scream. He wanted to cry. He wanted to shake them till their pea brains rattled right out of their ears!"I, Sirius Black, do solemnly swear to keep this oath, and protect Remus's secret," Sirius said, cutting into his hand, his own blood mingling a little with some of James's. He studied the red trickling down for a second then held out the knife to Peter who began shaking. Remus hoped he wouldn't do it, but..."I, Peter Pettigrew, do solemnly swear to k-keep this oath, and p—protect Remus's secret." He gave a yelp as he cut his hand, not quite as deeply as the other two did but enough to draw blood.James, Sirius, and Peter all looked completely unreal, kneeling on the cavern floor in their pajamas, the wind rustling their hair, the stars shining down on them as their blood dripped out. It was like a scene out of a book, and Remus felt ill.The smell of blood permeated the air, clogging up Remus's sensitive nose, poking the wolf a little. He wrapped his arms around himself, rubbing his elbows, unable to believe that this just happened, hair raising as James's watch beeped to announce that it was midnight.Uneasy silence.Then..."See?" Sirius asked cheerfully. "Nothing bad haaaAAAAAAAA!" He gave a great cry of pain and fell backwards, body thrashing. The other three began screaming, diving for Sirius as he writhed around then suddenly he gave a pained gasp then went completely still, eyes closed, limbs skewed at odd angles."Sirius?!" James shook him desperately."BOO!" Sirius sat upright and all three jumped back, screaming more. "Got you!" he shrieked then began laughing, clutching his stomach as he rolled back and forth, smearing blood across his silk pajamas."You absolute ass!" Remus snapped, smacking Sirius's arm multiple times. "You SCARED me!""That was MEAN!" Peter complained."That was great!" James snickered.Sirius just grinned at Remus who gave another furious smack on the arm. "Jerk!"James got out three handkerchiefs for them to wrap around their hands, and when Remus asked about wound healing salve James said he didn't want to do that until the next day to 'make sure'. Make sure of what?! Remus wondered wildly, head pounding."We better get back now," James said as they got to their feet. "We have a big day ahead of us.""Oh right, Remus's, um, mind thing," Peter said, giving Remus an encouraging smile as James flung the cloak around them once more.Sirius smacked Remus's back with his right hand, the uncut one. "We've got a battle tomorrow. See? We'll do everything and anything to protect you, Remy."Peter was studying his hand, at the blood-soaked handkerchief wrapped around it. "We will," he promised."That's what the Marauders do," James said firmly. "Protect each other. No matter what.""No matter what," Sirius echoed."No matter what!" Peter repeated.They all looked at Remus who closed his eyes. "No matter what," he reluctantly agreed. "But you're still bloody idiots."

Remus woke up, thrashing violently in his bed, getting tangled up in his blanket. "No! Pleeeaaaase don't!"Sirius was at his bedside immediately, as if he hadn't even been asleep. "Remus?" He slid through the curtains, shutting them behind him, reaching out. "Remus, it's okay, hey, it's okay." He put his hand on Remus's arm and Remus lay still, panting heavily, sweat soaking through his pajamas. "What happened?""I—I don't remember everything," he lied, slowly working on getting untangled from his bed clothes. His nightmare had involved dark figures pinning him down, doing some sort of blood magic to somehow purge the world of werewolves, stabbing his hands through with silver daggers then slitting his throat. He unconsciously pressed his right thumb into his left palm, rubbing lightly.Sirius noticed, and paled. "Was it because of what we did?"Remus avoided his eyes, hands jerking apart. "I don't know," he lied again."We didn't mean to upset you. We just wanted to... do something. For you. About... all of this."He began adjusting his blanket, smoothing it out carefully. "I know.""Are you upset?"He looked at the curtains then frowned at Sirius, dropping his voice lower. "Let me think, you three did something incredibly stupid and dangerous, possibly calling upon one of the most ancient forms of magic on one of the most magical nights of the year." He gave Sirius a light shove. "Yes I'm upset."Sirius huffed. "We didn't do any magic...""As far as you know!" Remus hissed out. "What if you did? What if something happens?""Well, the only way something would happen is if one of us breaks the oath, which isn't going to happen anyway," Sirius replied, obviously intending to sound logical.Remus sighed, still seeing the knife in his head, still smelling the blood. Actually, the smell of blood was really strong. Very strong. Too strong. His eyes drifted to Sirius's hand and he noticed a new handkerchief wrapped around it. The blood soaking through was dry... but smelled fresher than... it should..."Hey!" Sirius complained as Remus grabbed his hand, untying the handkerchief. The wound was definitely bigger! He lifted Sirius's hand to show him."Nothing bad? Your wound is bigger."Sirius yanked his hand away. "That's not because of anything to do with making a blood oath on Halloween.""Really?" Remus glowered. "Then why is your wound bigger? It's just doing that on its own, is it?"Sirius rewrapped the cloth around, tying it haphazardly. It slipped down so Remus reached over, tying it for him. "James and I did something else," he finally admitted."Cut your hands open again?""Yes," he replied hesitantly.Remus looked up into his face. "Why?"Sirius shrugged and pulled his hand back now that the wound was covered again. "It's nothing to do with you. It's something else. I don't want to talk about it."He was torn between relief and worry. Relief that his initial fear of the wound magically getting worse wasn't true, but worry over the fact he suspected James and Sirius made another blood pact between the two of them, and he had no idea what kind... or what they did for it. "You didn't use your wands, did you?""No, just the knife again," Sirius promised, smiling brightly. "Don't worry, we didn't call upon our ancestors in a crazed ritual to bring Snape eternal misery. Although..." He tapped his finger theatrically against his chin. "That's not such a bad idea."Remus grunted and pushed at Sirius. "Go to bed.""Calling upon the house of Black to haunt him—""Bed!""—positively hellish torture, that is!""Goodnight!"/\/\/\/\/\Thank Merlin the next day was Wednesday. All four Marauders slept in late, waking up only in to get ready for the day, sneak into the kitchens for some food, then hurry to their first class of the day. Remus could hardly pay attention. He kept jiggling his foot while Flitwick demonstrated today's spell, doodling absentmindedly on his paper. What did taking notes matter anyway?He didn't want to eat lunch, just pushed food around, and was unfocused through the rest of the classes. Binns gave them a surprise exam which Remus knew would give him his worst History grade yet if he had to stay. Nothing on the test made sense to him and he just scribbled in what he hoped were the right answers. During Transfiguration all the words in his book and notes seemed jumbled together. Even Lily seemed to notice something was wrong and Remus just told her that he wasn't feeling great. She frowned, but didn't press.After their last class let out the four Marauders wandered around the school. James and Sirius tripped a few other students then, after attempting and failing to set up a slime spell in a toilet, they they returned to their dorm to play cards. Well, Remus didn't play. He tried to but after one round he just jumped up and began restlessly going through his books.Finally he sat on the floor, pulling his fake silver necklace out from his shirt. He turned it over and over in his fingers; first one way, then the other, running the pad of his thumb across the etching of the eye. He wrapped his fingers around the pendent and squeezed it tightly, praying to everything that a miracle would happen./\/\/\/\/\Remus couldn't eat supper either, he just poked at what little food he put on his plate, resisting the urge to vomit. Or cry. Or both. James and Peter were playing a word game—coming up with creatures alphabetically back and forth—while Sirius ate in silence, watching Remus.He felt a nudge under the table, Sirius's foot against his own. Remus glanced up. "It'll be fine," he said, sounding completely assured.Remus shoved his plate away and left the room, fleeing to the nearest bathroom to throw up. Then the tears came. He was still crying when the other Marauders came in. "S—sorry," he choked out, rubbing his eyes. "It's not g-g-going to work.""Don't say that!" Peter said while Sirius gave Remus some wet paper towels.James squeezed Remus's shoulder reassuringly. "You're a Gryffindor. We go down fighting.""And we are going to fight," Sirius said darkly as he began to pace."Remy, look." James held out his right hand, palm facing Remus. There was a faint scar there, as they had used healing potion that morning so none of the teachers would notice. "Even though that's gonna fade, we'll always have that mark of our friendship with you. Fawley isn't going to pull us apart that easily. Neither is Dumbles.""All for one, and one for all," said Peter with a clap of his hands.Sirius stopped pacing. "And four to the end," he added, causing them all to smile, even Remus./\/\/\/\/\Remus stalked back and forth in the hallway, running his fingers through his hair until it stuck out at all sorts of odd angles. It was time for Occlumency. Time to tell Miss Fawley everything, and—and..."Just let us know when it's time for us to come in," Sirius said, grabbing Remus by the shoulders to make him still. "You got this."Remus swallowed. "I got this," he echoed then turned to face the door. "I got this."James squeezed his shoulder again, Peter pat his back, and Sirius lightly tousled his hair. Remus sucked in some air then opened the door with a shaky hand."Remus," she said, smiling as she set her braille book to the side."M—Miss Fawley." He remained by the door, legs quaking so bad it was a wonder she didn't hear his knees knocking. He forced himself to take a step, then another. "How are you d-d-doing t-t-tonight?"She tipped her head, frowning. "I'm doing well. You, however, are not.""I—I'm fine," he mumbled."I can tell by your voice you are not fine." She pat the couch and he obediently sat down. "Did something happen?"He was sweating now, and had to remove his robes, wiping his hands off on them before letting them fall to the floor. "A... a lot of th-things, I guess. Um. So. There is some stuff I n-need to talk to you about, before we—we get started." He curled his hands into fists, digging his nails into his palm, trying to keep himself from sounding reasonable and mature, not like the totally panicked, freaked out child he was. "Professor Prewett said s—something very nice the other day.""Oh?""Yeah. He... he told me I was... r-really good at his class, that I had, um, an affinity for it. He told me I c-could go far in that field."Fawley smiled broadly. "That's wonderful to hear!""Yes. It—it's very wonderful," he agreed, focusing on keeping his breathing even. "He t-told me it'd be a shame if my brain went to waste.""I agree with him, wholeheartedly.""You do?"Fawley raised her eyebrows. "Of course I do. You're a brilliant young man, Remus. Remarkable intellect! It isn't just Defense Against the Dark Arts you seem to have an affinity for, it's everything! Except Potions."Remus managed a small laugh at that. "Yeah... still my—my downfall." He moved his hands to his lap now, twisting the hem of his vest around his fingers. "I... I wouldn't want to waste my... education either. I'm g—glad you agree.""Why wouldn't I?" she asked, smile faltering. "Is something going on?"Remus glanced at the door then back at Miss Fawley. "I'm always worried my parents will make me go back home," he said slowly."Have they said anything in a letter recently?""N... not... explicitly," he admitted, "but it's still a fear of mine. I don't want to go home. I want to stay in school, I want to learn!"Fawley reached over, hand sweeping a little before she found his. He was a little afraid she'd go into his mind right away for some reason and see the truth before he could lay the foundation. "I'll do whatever I can to help convince them you belong here."He smiled now, a real smile. "Promise?""Of course.""Promise you'll help me stay at school?"Fawley's smile faded entirely. "You know I will.""And that my education is—is the most important thing?"She stiffened, withdrawing her hand. "Yes," she said hesitantly. "Why?" He looked at the door then back at her. "Remus. What's going on?""Um." He shifted in his seat then slid back, a little farther from her. He had no idea how she'd react. "The thing is..."Her whole body was tense now and her brow was snapped down. "What happened?"Remus took in a deep breath and closed his eyes. His stomach was churning so violently, like a hurricane at sea. He just hoped he wouldn't throw up again. "The... they... they... the—they found out."Silence."What?!" Fawley demanded, voice trembling.He opened his eyes, heart practically ready to burst out of his chest with as hard as it was going. "The other Marauders. They know I'm a werewolf."He cringed back as Fawley stood at full height. She seemed taller than she normally did, towering over him, face blazing with fury. "What did you just say?!" she demanded, struggling to keep from shouting. "Please tell me I misheard you, or that you're playing some sort of Halloween prank!"Remus slid off the couch, backing away from her, nearly tripping over his fallen robes. "Miss Fawley—""No, don't you 'Miss Fawley' me!" she snapped. "You need to explain yourself. Is this a prank?"He tried to speak and it took a couple tries before he managed to say, "N-no."Her nostrils flared. "When did you find out? Just now? Where are they? Do you think they've gone to anyone about this?""N—no," he put in quickly. "They haven't t-t-told anyone else. Just—just me. They wanted... to t-tell me they knew..."Fawley slowly nodded. "That is good. That means we can take care of this without any trouble—""Miss Fawley...""We'll need to see Albus immediately—""Miss Fawley?""—before they decide to contact the Ministry—""Miss Fawley!" he snapped and she trailed off, turning her face towards him. "Miss Fawley, they..." Oh boy. "They've... known for a—f-for... a-a while..."She didn't say anything for several second then slowly sank back down onto the couch. "How long?"He looked down at the floor, poking at the stone with his foot. "Um. Well. P—Peter found out about a—a week and a half ago. During the l-last full moon. James has, um, known for over a month. And... and Sirius...""And Mr. Black?" she demanded icily.He pressed his fingers against his eyelids. "Since last spring," he whispered, the confession hanging heavily between them.She didn't reply right away so he forced himself to open his eyes, to look at her. She had her head in her hands, radiating disappointment and fear. He wanted to apologize... but how could he do that?"How long have you known they've known? That he's known?""A week, that's all," he promised, taking a few nervous steps towards her. "They told me after the last full moon."She raised her head. "And you haven't told anyone?" Her meaning was clear. How stupid was he?"I—I was going to!" He wrung his hands, nails scraping along his skin. "I... I had a breakdown Tuesday night and wound up in the hospital...""Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?" Her tone and words slapped him hard and he staggered back, shocked she'd say such a thing. "Remus." She sat up straight, hair cascading down over her shoulders. "You... you're risking you life. You understand that, don't you?""Y—yes!""Because it sure as Merlin doesn't sound like you do." She sounded sad, and a little hurt. Like him not doing anything about this had actually hurt her. Or perhaps it was just bringing back memories of her sister.He finally sat back down next to her. "I do understand. And... I... I trust them."She let out a sharp laugh. "They're twelve!""So am I!"She sighed, falling against the back of the couch, tipping her head back. "Remus. I know that right now things seem simple—""They're not simple," he interrupted, annoyed. "Everything's complicated, and—and confusing, and I hate it. B-but the Marauders... they make things a little better for me. And I trust them, I do. They're my best friends. They're—they're more than my best friends." He knew he couldn't explain how he started feeling recently, how close he felt to them. How it seemed so much stronger than what he ever expected a friendship to feel like. Maybe he was imagining it, or maybe that is how regular friendships felt... but ever since they told him they knew things seemed to have shifted a little."They are children," she replied flatly.He had nothing to argue that, so he changed his line of reasoning, hoping one of the alleys he tried would work. "Isn't it my decision whether or not to trust them?""You're just a child," she pointed out.Oops. Well. "D-do you know what they did? After I... I flipped out and—and begged them for mercy and asked if they had called anyone to come kill me?" He didn't wait for her to answer. "They hugged me. I told them not to, because I was a monster, and they still hugged me. They told me I wasn't a monster. That I'm a good person." He felt his nose burning and tears welling up, and he bowed his head even though she couldn't see the tears. "They've been... so kind to me... since everything happened."Fawley moved closer to him, sliding her hand on his back. "I'm sorry. I am. I understand your feelings. However, you need to realize that you cannot trust three children with such a dangerous secret.""So... what? Dumbledore erases their memory?""Yes, I'm afraid—""And then I leave school?" He jerked away from her, so she couldn't touch him. "I can't stay. If they figured it out once, they'll figure it out again. I go home, then.""Remus—""And this was all for nothing." He balled his hands into fists and jumped to his feet, tears dripping down. "My hard work, my grades... all those hours of studying... for nothing." He had a nightmare the previous school year, of him wasting away into nothing while remaining hidden in a cottage and it burned inside of him now. "I don't want to lose this." She got up, approaching him carefully, fingers brushing against his shoulder, but he pulled back. "I w-w-want to stay!" It was slipping away. He knew it wouldn't work. He knew. He shouldn't have ever allowed the slightest bit of hope into him. He sniffled loudly, wiping his nose off on his sleeve. "I trust them.""I know you do, and—and that is wonderful, it is. But that doesn't make it safe."His head began throbbing as he fought to keep hold of his emotions. The wolf was stirring inside of him, agitated by his frustration. He doubted he'd be able to argue articulately and decided it was just time to bring in the heavy duty artillery. "Will you at least hear them out?""Will I... what?" Her face twisted into an unreadable expression. "I don't—" He went past her, to the door, swaying a bit due to being dizzy and lightheaded. "Remus, they're not... please tell me they're not out there!""At least let them talk to you themselves." He wrenched open the door causing his friends to all jump. They were across the hall and gave him hopeful looks which disappeared when he shook his head. They crossed the corridor, nervously entering the room. He shut the door behind Peter and waited, having no idea whatsoever what was going to happen next.Miss Fawley stood ramrod straight by the couch, arms tight at her sides. James strode forward, sticking his hand out. "Hi!" he said cheerfully. "I'm James Potter!" He stood in front of her, hand still out for a brief second, then he looked rather abashed and let his hand drop. "Remus's friend," he continued as if this were some sort of newspaper interview, "and Chaser extraordinaire."Remus moaned and dropped his head in his hands."I know who you are," Fawley forced out."Great!" James beamed, clapping his hands together once. "Now, I know you probably don't think it's a good idea that we know—""The more people who know, Mr. Potter, the more likely your friend will be executed," she interrupted.If she expected this to provoke a shocked reaction she was sorely mistaken. James merely tilted his head. "Do you feel the same about Professor Sprout knowing?""Mr. Potter—""Or Slughorn? Or Flitwick?""Mr. Potter—""Did you oppose Dedenne knowing?"To Remus's surprise, Fawley's face flushed very slightly. "No," she admitted, voice softening a bit. "However there is an enormous difference between an adult knowing and a child knowing—""Even though said adult verbally attacked him and treated him like shit for a year with no other adult interfering?" James asked, voice suddenly going cold and dark, so notably different from his usual sunny disposition that Remus shivered. James Potter had come for a battle. Something powerful rose in Remus's chest at the sight of someone fighting so loyally for for him, but it also kinda scared him."I did not know the extent of what was going on," Fawley said in a clipped tone. "If I did, I would have done something about it. But either way, what happened with Dedenne does not change the fact three children cannot be trusted with his secret.""Um. Um." Peter fidgeted, wringing his hands. "Hi. Um. I'm—I'm Peter and—and well, I know it's silly to think we could keep his secret but—why would we ever blab? Cause Remus is our friend. He's one of my best friends. I—I'd never do anything to hurt him!""You may think that now, Mr. Pettigrew, however what happens if you fight? If you break off your friendship?""Never gonna happen," James grumbled.Fawley grabbed for her cane. "I'm going to Albus. I'm sorry. I am. But I can't allow this." She started walking then stopped as Sirius sidestepped, blocking her from the door. Fawley gripped her cane so tightly that her knuckles turned white. "Mr. Black, I presume.""Guilty as charged," Sirius replied, folding his arms and leveling his chin. "You're going to go to Dumbledore to erase our memories, right?""Yes."Sirius's eyes drifted over towards Remus. "What's going to happen to Remus?" Fawley hesitated, not expecting that comment. "After our memories are erased," he clarified, in case she didn't get his meaning."He... will... return home.""Do you know what will happen to him?""I told you, he will return h—""No." Sirius shifted his weight then hunched his shoulders. "What will happen to him after he returns home? You realize what that will do to him? You know him. You know him probably better than us, possibly better than his parents cause of seeing his memories. Taking him away from Hogwarts—from school, from classes, from his education—will kill him. I... I know werewolves can heal from a lot of things, but I think breaking his heart's going to do some pretty hefty damage."Remus couldn't move. It felt like Sirius had reached into him and pulled out his very essence. How was he so aware of how Remus felt? Was thinking? And the bit about heartbreak... it made him want to go over and hug Sirius. It was strange to be so noticed and understood."This isn't the stage, Mr. Black; save your theatrics," Fawley said harshly. "We aren't discussing some small matter. This is something very important; beyond schoolboy whims."Sirius narrowed his eyes. "Ma'am, I know perfectly well you think very little of me, but I will do anything to protect Remus. That includes protecting him from being hurt. And kicking him out of school is going to hurt him. So I won't allow it.""Neither will I," James said, taking a long step to stand next to Sirius."Me too!" Peter said, scurrying to stand on Sirius's other side.Fawley bowed her head, rubbing her temple. She couldn't see the stubborn looks on their faces but Remus knew she could hear it in their voices. Remus began chewing his nails, eyes darting back and forth between them and her, waiting for her to respond."I cannot allow any risks to his life," Fawley finally answered. "You are far too young to hold a secret such as this. Friendships... perhaps yours would remain strong, but friendships come and go. Remus's curse is going to be with him until either a cure is found, or he dies.""Our friendship doesn't go," Peter said, sticking his lower lip out."We're not little," James protested. "Maybe we are only twelve but that doesn't mean we take this lightly!""We've done quite a bit of research into... things," Sirius added. "We're all well aware of what would happen if we slip up."James gave a wry smile. "We keep secrets. And this is the biggest Marauder secret. We care about Remus.""And if a teacher who barely knows him can be told and, um, trusted to keep the secret then surely we who know him and everything can be trusted!" put in Peter.Sirius licked his lips, then pushed his hair back. "Can I talk to you for a second, ma'am? Privately?""Why?" she asked suspiciously."Please?"Fawley thought about this for a second then slowly nodded. "Very well. Will you three wait outside?"They went out of the room, sitting down on a nearby bench. Remus sat down on his hands to keep them from shaking, staring at the door, wondering what on earth Sirius could be saying to her. He couldn't hear anything due to the soundproofing spells on the door.James put an arm around him while Peter leaned against him, head resting against Remus's arm. "He's probably making it worse," Remus whispered, rocking back and forth a little. She hated Blacks so much. Maybe she'd just hex him. Peter linked his arm through Remus's, squeezing to try and reassure him. Nobody said anything else and the minutes stretched on. Just when Remus thought he couldn't take it another second, the door opened.Fawley's face looked impassive as she said, "May I speak to either Potter or Pettigrew alone as well?" She moved so Sirius could come out, paler than usual. Peter gulped and James got up, messing up his hair before striding into the room. The door shut, and Sirius sat down where James had been."What did you talk to her about?" Remus asked.Sirius gave a faint smile. "Whether I'm capable of keeping your secret. Of course."Remus nudged him. "Really, what did you tell her?"Sirius looked around then bent in close. "I told her I wasn't my family, all right? I told her I—I take more pride in being a Marauder than I ever did being a Black. I told her... how important you are to me. I also answered her questions.""What questions?" Peter asked, knowing he'd be called in next, rather like they were being given individual lectures from a teacher."She asked why I told you and James. Why I didn't tell Remus from the start." Sirius turned his head away, sounding awkward as he said, "Why I didn't allow the spells to be put on my curtains, and why I always go to you when you have nightmares. Didn't realize she knew that.""I can't control what she sees," Remus said apologetically.Sirius rolled his eyes towards him. "It's fine. A bit embarrassing, but fine." He ran his fingers restlessly through his hair. "Stuff like that. Basically quizzed me to an inch of my life about how loyal I am to Remy." He paused and then said, "I told her about the oath.""You WHAT?!" Remus half-shrieked, heart hammering in his chest. "That—she—""It proves we're loyal."Remus grabbed Sirius's arm. "It proves you're idiots!" He wondered what Fawley's reaction to that was, surprised she didn't just go straight to Dumbledore after hearing it!Sirius gave him a broad grin. "We may be idiots, Remy, but we're loyal idiots."Remus groaned while Peter nodded before resting his cheek back on Remus's shoulder. "She's gotta see how much we care and how much we wanna protect you.""I believe she's going to see you are all idiots," he grumbled. "Is that why you did the oath? To—to prove to her—""No!" Sirius snapped. "Absolutely not. We did it because we care about you, and we wanted to have—wanted to do it out of our loyalty to you. It is nothing to do with Fawley and everything to do with you, okay?"Remus gave a small nod, and left it at that.James was with Miss Fawley a lot shorter than Sirius was, and when he came out, Peter went in."Boy, she's a nosy one," James grumbled, stretching his legs out. "I think it went well though. Nobody can resist the ol' Potter charm."Peter was only in there three minutes tops. His face was bright pink when the door opened again and he scurried over to join his friends. Sirius and James stood with Remus but Fawley shook her head, stating she needed to speak to Remus again. James squeezed Remus's hand before he went over, trying not to feel sick.The door swung shut behind him.Remus went over to the sofa and sat, waiting for the verdict. Fawley approached him as one might a skittish animal, at least that's how it seemed to him. "Remus." She sat next to him, taking his hand gently. "It isn't safe."He turned his head away from her, rage and depression battling it out inside his head."However."He froze, then slowly looked back at her. However?"This isn't an easy black and white decision. On one hand, if we go to Albus, we will be protecting you. On the other hand... as much as I hate to agree with anything a Black says, I know perfectly well removing you from Hogwarts will be detrimental to you. To your mental health." She rubbed the bridge of her nose. "Your parents have done questionable things in the name of keeping you safe. Things I don't agree with. Which is worse? Physically harming a child, or mentally and emotionally harming a child? Could I really say I am doing the right thing by taking you out of your element? By taking you away what's given you essentially water and light to a plant? You've changed for the better in the past year, Remus. Coming to school has done you so much good. They have done you so much good."Remus was so confused. He didn't understand. What was she saying? That she was going to let this continue? Or that she wasn't?She got back up and began pacing, her cane clacking against the stone. "I don't trust them. Potter's too cocky, Pettigrew's too nervous, and Black—well, Black is a Black.""Would you trust him if he weren't?" Remus couldn't help but whisper, not wanting to break her process of thought but having to speak up in defense of Sirius."I would trust him more if he weren't," she admitted, "but not fully. Disregarding my personal feelings towards them, there is no doubting their love for you. I don't think I've ever seen young children with such an intense bond. Frankly, it's a little disconcerting. I knew the four of you were close but it seems like since I last met with you things have escalated at a frightening rate. That... blood oath they took... could potentially be—""I—I know, I tried t-t-to talk them out of it—""I know it isn't your fault..."Remus watched her walking back and forth, resisting the urge to shout at her to just tell him her decision. He kept his mouth clamped tightly shut, body practically vibrating with anticipation."I came here to be your tutor," she went on, and he tried not to groan. "I try not to overstep myself. That is one reason I never told anyone about your pranks, because that is a betrayal of trust. It's not my duty to snitch on you. Unless, as I've stated before, it's when great harm is placed on another. Either someone hurting you, or you've hurt someone. Which comes back to the point Black made. Forcing you to drop out would do great harm."He bit his bottom lip now, teeth digging in until there was a sharp burst of pain and blood seeped onto his tongue."I don't trust them," she said again and finally stopped moving, facing him, "but that is my opinion, not yours. It's very clear you trust them, and that they feel at this moment in time they are extremely loyal to you. You are young, but you know exactly what will happen if they ever break that trust. If you are that determined... then I find it rather hard to purposely lock you away from everything on the chance something might happen.""M—Miss Fawley?"She bowed her head. "I'm not going to go to Albus."

Remus leapt to his feet, nearly falling flat on his face. "WHAT?! R—really? Really? Rea—really? Really?" He was saying the same thing over and over but didn't know how to say anything else, everything had been blasted clean out of his brain."Yes," she said then gave a short laugh as he hugged her. "Oh, Remus, I'm not happy with this, but I'll go with your decision unless it starts turning out for the worse, all right? If I see any hint of things crumbling, I may step in to prevent a disaster.""Yes, yes, yes I—I understand—I—oh!" He hugged her tighter, being careful not to hug too tightly. He began to cry. "Thank you. Thank you. Th-thank you, Miss Fawley." He began sobbing, like a little child, but was too overwhelmed with joy to feel too ashamed. "Thank you."Her hand settled on his head. "I think, all things considered, we should put our lesson off for another week."Remus laughed, falling back from her and rubbing his eyes on his sleeves. "Thank you. I can't even... oh, oh Miss Fawley...""Be careful—""I will. I promise. I will. They're—th-thank you." He couldn't believe it. She had—she—he was—He whirled around, stumbling to the door, falling over finally. He just scrambled back up and yanked the door open so hard the knob slammed into the stone wall. James, Sirius, and Peter all looked at him, getting to their feet.He took in a deep breath and simply said, "Yes."They gave cries of joy and were suddenly on him, squashing him between them as they hugged him, all jumping, laughing, and shrieking with jubilation and triumph, and Remus laughed, jumped, and hugged as well but then he just sort of stood there in a daze. I'm staying. One of them put their arms around him and half-spun him, then he faintly heard Sirius say something about how none of them really ate supper, and then Pete suggested raiding the kitchens. Then they started walking off, and it took a couple seconds for them to realize Remus was still standing there.James waved his hand in front of Remus's face. He blinked then jerked back, startled. "You all right?""Um. I—I don't know," Remus admitted.James put his arm around him. "Come on. You two get some food, I'll get him to the dorms." He began walking, pulling Remus along. Remus stumbled, allowing himself to be led, completely out of it that James could have easily led him right into a wall and he would walked right into it. James noticed that Remus was not very present and stopped in his tracks. Remus bumped into him. "You sure you're okay?" he asked, concerned."I... I just... can't believe... she—she—she agreed?"James smiled. "Yeah. Come on, hop on.""Huh?"He turned, squatting a little. "You're worse than usual, Brains. I'll carry you.""No, I'm—""Unable to walk on your own. Come on."Remus put his arms around James's neck and James stood up, grabbing Remus's legs. He hitched him a little higher then began half-walking, half-galloping. Remus laughed. "You'll hurt yourself."James snorted. "You weigh like, five pounds. My broom weighs more than you!""Don't make me smack you.""I'm your horse right now, that's animal abuse."Remus just smiled, not saying anything in response, just watching the back of James's head. James Potter was a prankster, a jokester, a show-off... arrogant and cocky... yet he had... immediately accepted Remus and fought for him to stay in school. He could still see James standing before Fawley, unafraid. "Thank you," he whispered."Eh? Aw, no problem, little buddy. You were practically falling over every step anyway."Remus didn't correct him on what he was thanking him for, just shifted his arms and went back to trying to grasp the fact he was staying. Staying! His friends knew and he was staying, Fawley—and he was staying!James carried him up to the portrait of the Fat Lady then deposited him on the floor, giving the password. He helped Remus through and immediately Remus knew something was up. The entire atmosphere of the common room was... different. Giddier. Girls were giggling even more than usual, and a lot of the boys seemed keyed up about something. It was so bad even James noticed."We miss something?" he asked, scanning the room. He stopped when he saw Colgate curled up in an armchair, nose deep in a book. "Come on." She looked up as they approached, and immediately dissolved into giggles. "Hey, is—did something happen?"Colgate raised her book to her mouth, giggling even more. "Oooh, you weren't in the Great Hall when Dumbledore made the announcement!""What announcement?" James asked, hands on hips.She sank down in her seat, making a strange squealing sort of sound. "A dance!" she gasped out."A... what?" James and Remus exchanged looks."Dance!" She sat upright now, eyes shining. "A proper dance! You know, boys and girls going together? Unfortunately it's just for fourth years and up, though if a fourth year or up asks someone younger they can go.""Oh," Remus said, disappointed it was something so boring."Oh," James said, sounding disappointed it was something so boring."Uh-huh." Colgate stood up then sat back down so her feet were tucked up underneath her. She smoothed her skirt out. "It's on the sixteenth. Of December.""That's the day we go home for the holidays, isn't it?" James asked."Yeah, but Dumbledore said anyone staying for the dance can go home on the seventeenth," she explained. "I kinda want to stay... I mean, I won't be able to go but I really want to see the decorations and some of the dresses." She gave a longing sigh.James scoffed. "Right, well, c'mon Remus, we've got stuff to do." He walked over to the stairs without another word, and Remus gave Colgate a small, dazed wave before hurrying after him.At least talking to Colgate had shaken him a little bit out of his shock, but he still wasn't fully recovered. Once up in the dorm he excused himself to go to the bathroom but instead of the toilet he went into one of the shower stalls, curling up on the floor and crying into his hands. I'm staying. They know, and I'm staying. She's letting this happen. He wanted to go back to Fawley and thank her again, and again, and again. He replayed her words in his head, trying to figure out precisely what convinced her. Whether it was his own pleading to remain at school, or what the other Marauders said.He knew that at any point she could change her mind. But. He was staying, for now.By the time he calmed down, washed his face, and returned to the dorm Sirius and Peter were back with food. Remus grinned, bouncing over to James's bed where all the food was. He climbed up and began filling up a plate while James was putting curtains up over the door, to muffle their sounds. The topic of conversation was, unfortunately, the dance. Sirius seemed super excited about, ignoring the fact completely he couldn't go."First of all, an older girl will ask me," he said, pointing his fork at James who had mentioned the age limit. "Second of all, we're the Marauders. Sneaking into things is our fort!""Forte," Remus mumbled."Thirdly... ummm... well, no third, mostly the second." Sirius stabbed a piece of chicken and began waving it around. "We're sneaking in.""And playing a prank?" James asked, jumping back onto the bed, sending some of the food off the large tray.Sirius broke into a grin. "Oh. Without a doubt!""I can't," Peter said and everyone looked at him. "James said Colgate said it's after we leave for the holidays. Since I'm too young to go to the dance I don't think my parents will let me stay.""Yeah, I wouldn't be able to put off returning home," added Remus, trying to imagine the outrage from his mother if he attempted such a request! "I guess you two are on your own."Sirius made a face. "Thinking about it, my mother probably wouldn't be too pleased."James sighed. "Mine wouldn't care, but without you lot it wouldn't be any fun! Anyway..." He leaned over to his desk, pulling out a bottle of butterbeer. "Ta-da!" He twisted the cap off, pouring the liquid into the cups. They frothed up nicely. "We've got something more important than a stupid dance to think about right now." He handed the cups around and some of Remus's sloshed since his hands were still a bit shaky. "To Remus," James said, and Remus flushed a little."No, to—to you," he said, giving them each a smile. "You were all amazing back there. I can't believe you somehow convinced her..." He wanted to say that they were like knights in shining armor, but that'd be super silly so he didn't. "You did it.""Course we did," James replied with absolute self importance.Sirius laughed then looked over at Peter. "She didn't talk to you very long... what did she ask you?"Peter shrugged, sipping at his drink. "Um, just some stuff like why I felt like I could keep your secret, why I was okay with being 'round a—you-know-what. I guess she didn't think much of me.""Better than hating you," Sirius muttered into his cup. "What about you, Jimmy? What she ask you?""Eh, same things really," he replied with a shrug. "Asked me some intense stuff though.""Like what?" Sirius wanted to know.James looked at him then at Remus then down into his cup of butterbeer. "She asked if I ever had to choose between siding with you or protecting Remus which I'd do." Sirius raised his eyebrows while Remus clutched at his cup. They both wanted to know the answer, but neither dared speak up. James smiled and said, "I told her, I said, 'siding with Sirius pretty much means protecting Remus anyway'." He began laughing. "She didn't like that. Kept telling me to answer her, and I said that I did.""I think the hardest thing she asked me was what I'd do if the Ministry tried to question me if Remus is a werewolf or not," Peter said. Everyone gave him curious looks. Pete smiled. "I thought about it for a moment then told her it's a good thing my grades aren't too great. She asked me what I meant and I said it means I can probably get away with..." Peter put on a glazed-eye, dumb look while he scratched his head. "Um, what's a werewolf?"Sirius, James, and Pete laughed at that, Sirius smacking Peter's arm."Did she say anything about your family, Sirius?" James asked once they calmed down.Sirius's smile faded into a scowl. "Of course she did. Told me flat out she doesn't trust me, because of my bloodline. Though she seemed surprised I didn't know my aunt killed her sister." The words jarred Remus and he stared at Sirius. "Yeah, she asked me about my aunt and I said I didn't know what she was talking about. I guess she thought it was a story told 'round my family but it's not really. I had no idea Fawley was involved. I told her I understood why she really hated us, then. I think she mighta been a bit disappointed I didn't put up a fight over her hatred of me."Pete's eyes got big. "You didn't argue with her?""No point. She has her views on what a Black is. Unfortunately, it's not far off the mark." He tipped his head way back to chug the last of his drink then wiped his mouth off on his sleeve."It is for you," Remus said softly and Sirius gave him a small smile."SO!" James said loudly causing Remus to jump, knocking some potatoes off his plate, sending them rolling to the floor. "How do you feel now, Remy?""Honestly, very shocked," he replied. "I had zero expectations I'd still be here. I could not see her allowing you to know my secret."Sirius reached over, messing up his hair. Remus grunted and pulled back, smoothing down his hair."You really had no hope?" James asked."No. I tried to. I... really tried. But I didn't.""You've spent the past several days acting normal when you were thinking you'd be leaving?" Sirius asked.Remus couldn't help but smile. "I'm a little used to acting normal when things inside of me are caving in to despair."None of them spoke then James let out a low whistle. "Merlin."He blushed, feeling stupid for admitting to such a thing. Even though they knew the truth didn't mean he should reveal everything abut himself. "It's—I meant—I'm not really—I shouldn't have—""Hey." Sirius bumped his shoulder against Remus's. "It's fine to say things like that. You can be honest with us, about... what it's like.""Yeah," Peter said brightly. "I mean, we know so you can say whatever now."Remus sniffled a little and might have started crying again if James didn't go, "You're going to make him cry." So instead Remus glared at James who fluttered his eyelashes at him. "Nothing wrong with crying. Ow!" he yelped as Remus straightened his leg to kick at James's shoe. "But really, say whatever you want. Even if it's stuff like what you just did. I mean, you don't have anyone to talk to this about, right? Except Fawley?""N... no..." He set his cup down and then tucked his hands under his legs. "You know... I've wished for something like this for over a year. Someone my own age I could t—talk to. About... things.""Now you do," Peter said after he realized Remus wasn't going to say anything else. "You got three of'em.""What sort of things have you been wanting to ask?" James wanted to know.Remus looked back down, not sure how to respond to that, because what he wanted to know was stuff he didn't think he should ask about. Things involving the crazy feelings he sometimes had. "I do have... a question. I wanted to ask before but..." Remus didn't lift his head, didn't really want to see their faces as he spoke. "What was it like, when you realized... or were told? About—about me? Your initial... thoughts? I know you guys said stuff about... being surprised and... well, I just was wondering.""I didn't believe it for a while," Sirius told him. "I think that's why it took me so long. I really just kept denying it, like—what Peter said before about how he always thought werewolves were these big muscled people... I thought so too. I was raised on the whole... brute image. You're so small and sickly instead of giant and scary. No offense. Plus you're so... sweet. And kind. And—" Sirius stopped suddenly, and coughed. "Anyway, it's just... it was hard for me to match you up with what I assumed werewolves were. I was a little scared, for a little bit, because just all of a sudden I realized you were one but that didn't last long at all, because it's you.""I felt the same way, when Sirius told me," Peter said."Yeah, same here," James agreed. "I had that whoa moment then... okay. I mean, I wasn't just 'okay' but I wasn't frightened or scared or anything." He pushed his fingers through his hair, a crooked smile on his face. "I didn't believe Sirius at first. I kinda laughed at him, when he said you were a werewolf. My parents never told me much about werewolves but in all the stories they're huge and mean and don't even really look human most the time. Then when I accepted it, it just made everything make sense. I mean, I did notice it seemed pretty regular when you got sick, or your mum got sick." He paused for a moment then said, "It was a relief.""A—a relief?" Remus asked, confused.James's smile got a little tight. "Finding out you're a werewolf is a lot better than thinking you were dying."Nobody spoke for a moment after that then Remus looked at Peter. "I didn't believe it till we went to the hospital wing, under the cloak, really. There's nothing about you that really seems like a werewolf. I still kinda didn't believe it until you said you were. It's still kinda hard to think of you like that.""You know... I think given time I mighta figured it out," James said. "There were a couple times I knew you were sick during the full moon, but it didn't occur to me they were connected. Maybe after another year I would have.""I never would have," Peter said, making a face."I hope nobody else does," Remus murmured.James kicked his foot very gently. "Hey, nobody else spends as much time with you as we do. I do have another question for you, though, if that's okay. I've been thinking about it for a while." Remus nodded, unsure as to what it could be. "You said—you said before that you don't remember what it's like... when you're... um... transformed.""That's right...""I was just... wondering what it was like when you transform, then transform back," James said.Remus tilted his head. "Painful—""I meant, for your mind," James went on, moving his legs so he was in a kneeling position. "Is it like falling asleep and waking up?"Remus straightened up a little, kinda surprised by this question. It wasn't something he'd thought much about, much less be asked about. He didn't think his parents had ever once asked about that part of the experience. They sometimes asked about the before and during and after, but never the actual transitioning. "No," he finally said, tugging at the sleeve of his robe. "It's kinda like... um..." He struggled to figure out the best way to describe it. "Okay, you know how sometimes you sorta stop being... present in your body? It's a little like—""Wait, stop being what?" James asked."Stop being like... present... in your body?" Remus repeated, not sure how else to explain the feeling. "You know? When nothing around you feels real and it's all kinda... distant?" James and Peter were staring at him like he had suddenly just turned into Snape or something. Sirius was frowning, not looking quite as weirded out. "Um." Remus gulped and ducked his head, wondering if this was something normal humans didn't experience. "You... don't... g-get that, do you?""No," James and Peter chorused. Remus wanted to curl up into the smallest ball possible and disappear."Not... quite," Sirius said, carefully choosing his words. "But I've experienced something similar, I think."James raised his eyebrows at Sirius. "You what?"Sirius shrugged. "Once or twice. Not the same thing that Remus is describing though." Then suddenly his cheeks went rather pink and he tried to drink out of his cup but all his butterbeer was gone, so he took James's cup and drank that instead, obviously needing something to focus on besides what he just said. When he realized James was still staring at him (and Remus trying not to) he set the cup down. "I've had some... not so pleasant experiences in my life, and sometimes I kinda... go blank, I guess?"Remus felt relief flooding through his body because it made him feel like less of a freak, that someone else—someone undoubtedly human—went through something similar. It wasn't quite the same but close enough that he didn't feel utterly alone. Then relief was replaced with concern. Not so pleasant experiences?"So you do that?" Peter asked Remus."Um, sorta. It's... well, it's like... everything around me is getting farther away..." He traced designs on the blanket, the fabric feeling strange under his fingertip. "I'm in a lot of pain, when I transform. Mostly what's going on in my head is—is wanting the pain to stop. Then everything's sorta... fading. Like—this—this isn't—I'm sorry.""No, you can tell us," Sirius said. "If you want to.""If you don't want to it's fine," Peter added."It's up to you," finished James.Remus took in a deep breath and bent forward again, hiding his face against his legs again. "The wolf... gets stronger. It starts taking over. It sort've feels like I'm shrinking into nothing, and then usually the next thing I know is pain, when I'm transforming back into—into... not a wolf.""And nothing in between?" Sirius asked."Not... really. I sometimes remember vague feelings of... anger and fury." His voice broke a little and his body began trembling.Sirius reached over, pressing a hand against his upper arm. "Hey, don't make yourself tell us what you're not okay telling us."Remus sniffled. "It's more that it's embarrassing. It's... I'm n-not used to talking about it either. My whole life was spent being told don't talk about this to anyone and it's—well, it is difficult. But. I mean. You know and I—I think I'd rather you ask me for answers than try to surmise what might be, if that makes sense.""No matter what you tell us, we won't think anything bad about you," Peter promised."Unless you told us SURPRISE!" James shouted, causing the other three to jump. "You're a Slytherin in disguise! Then I might not be so favorable.""Well..." Remus couldn't help but smirk. "I do like the color green.""Ooof," James moaned. "Treading on thin ice there, buddy. See, werewolf I can handle. Slytherin... not so much."Remus kicked at him and they both laughed, Remus feeling a lot more comfortable. "Thank you. Again. For—for everything.""One for all, all for one, and four to the end," Sirius said."Is that really our new motto?" James grumbled."Can it be a 'new' motto if we never had an old one?" Peter asked."Probably?" James scratched his head. "Brains, I'll have to go to you for that one.""It depends on the context," said Remus. "For instance if you invented a new potion you could advertise it as new despite it not being based on an older potion. However... when it comes to a motto, I do believe we'd have to have an old one to have a new one.""Cool so now we have a motto, we can make a new one," James said, shooting a look at Sirius who stuck his tongue out."Hey, nothing wrong with all for one, one for all, and four to the end," Sirius said then stuck his hand up. "Show of hands, come on."Peter put his up with some trepidation. "I kinda like it."Remus put his up. "Actually, I like it too."James sighed then shoved his glasses back up. "Fine, fine. That'll be our motto."Shifting into a lighter mood felt good to Remus, and he got off the bed so he could turn the radio on. He didn't mind talking seriously but he just needed something else right now. He shifted through the stations until he got to the rock station then flopped back onto James's bed. The conversation shifted into jokes and teasing, tossing food at each other (and James crashing off the bed rather painfully to try to catch a carrot in his mouth), and it felt so good.However that night Remus could barely sleep. He kept tossing and turning, sitting upright multiple times whenever realization settled around him. Mostly he felt happy, sometimes he felt scared. Scared because now what? Ever since he had calmed down after the initial panic all he thought was, well soon I'll be gone, I won't be here. Now he was here to stay.How was he going to get through every single day with them knowing? He trusted them. Oh, without a doubt he trusted them. But it was still frightening.He fell backwards into bed, letting out a quiet breath. This is going to be so hard.

Author's Note: I realized yesterday I never once described Cassandra Inkwood in Shifting Lines (except a short line in Cath's one shot). So I have edited a few chapters to include the fact she is black: Book One: Chapter Eleven, A Griffin-Door, Chapter Thirty-Seven, His Blood Is Black. Book Two: Chapter Eight, Mature Enough. I could have sworn I described her but I searched through multiple chapters and realized I hadn't. Sorry about that! But of course since I made alterations to the chapters that aren't just fixing em dashes or grammatical errors I wanted to let you know. Also in this chapter there is some... body talk. Nothing really explicit. But if it's the sort of thing you need a trigger about please let me know so I can include them in future chapters, otherwise I won't be./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\The past several days hadn't really felt real to Remus; they had felt kinda like a dream. When he woke up Thursday reality hit him like a ton of bricks and that, coupled with his lack of sleep, made him just want to crawl under his bed. He managed to force himself into a uniform and go down to breakfast. All the chatter around him was just noise, even his friends. He was vaguely aware of them talking but none of it really made sense. James mentioned Sirius's birthday and Remus made himself focus to know what was going on, but even they didn't really know since Fridays were a busy day. Sirius said they could just celebrate in the night, stay up super late.Once classes begin, I'll be fine, he told himself but after he took his seat in Herbology he had difficult paying attention. Sprout didn't even sound like a person, she sounded kinda buzzy. Noise. Not English. Plus he barely remembered what they covered Tuesday or the previous Thursday (the only thing he did remember was Bones and Pierce giving him the get well card, which he had on his desk on his dorm). He felt lost and confused to the point when Sprout dismissed class she had him stay behind."You haven't seemed very present the past few classes," she said as he stood awkwardly in front of her table, intensely paying attention to her words so they didn't get lost in his fog. "Is everything okay?""I... d-d-didn't have a very good... last week..." he mumbled.Sprout frowned. She knew he was a werewolf but Remus realized that Professors Sprout and Flitwick had never once really mentioned it, or brought it up. He spoke about it with McGonagall somewhat, and had a couple vague incidents with Slughorn... and of course Prewett. But he really had no idea how Sprout or Flitwick really felt, except they didn't treat him unfairly like Dedenne had so they didn't hate him.What are you thinking? he wondered, looking up into Sprout's face."I heard you ended up in the hospital wing," she said with a slow nod. "Are you doing any better?""A—a bit, it's just... I guess I've m-missed a lot, and last week I... I was having trouble..." He shifted his weight, glancing at the doors, not wanting to be there. How ironic would it be after fighting to stay at Hogwarts his grades took a nosedive? "I'll do b-better though, Professor. I—I promise. I'm in a st-study group, and—" he broke off and quickly looked down at his raggedy trainers. "I'll do better," he whispered.Sprout gave a 'huh' sound and he thought she might say he had a lot of work to do, but instead she said, "Oh, I know you will. You're top in your year."Remus looked up, a little startled. Was he best in Herbology? "I... am?""If we're talking strictly knowledge and grades, yes," she said. "You do have a nice touch with plants, though there are other students who have much more of a green thumb than you do. A more natural..." she trailed off, trying to think of the right word."Affinity?" he offered with a whisper.Sprout smiled. "A more natural affinity with plants than you do, but as I said, your knowledge is outstanding. I didn't keep you back to tell you off, I kept you back because I could tell something was wrong."He blushed slightly and looked back down. "I'm s-sorry. I'm... st-starting to feel better though.""All right..." She stood up with a grunt and walked him over to the door. "I'm not your Head of House, Mr. Lupin, but I'm here for you, for all my students, regardless of what uniform they wear.""Thank you, Professor."Remus left the greenhouse, rushing over to where his friends had waited for him, promising them everything was fine. He felt rather happy as they headed to the castle. First Prewett telling him he was so good in Defense, and now Sprout saying his knowledge was outstanding. He was glad she mentioned other students were more connected to the class because while he liked Herbology well enough he knew Buckling loved plants, and Lily was pretty good even if she thought she wasn't, and he had heard that Toots from Ravenclaw was really good too.He knew he got good grades in all the classes except for Potions; he got top marks, but he wondered how many he was top-top in. Then he felt heat flooding his face at that conceited thought. James would definitely go around asking the teachers (if he cared to do that), but Remus would never be able to ask. Besides, it didn't really matter if he was top-top, what mattered was he knew he got great grades and did well in (almost) every class.He frowned, slowing his pace a little. In his first year he had tried to explore ways to prevent the scents of Potions class getting to him. He hadn't really done much research into it this year. I should do that this weekend, he decided. If the smells didn't bother him so much maybe he'd do a little better in that class."Reeemmuuusss!" Peter ran over, grabbing his arm. "James is being mean.""I am not!" James huffed."You called me a puffskein!""You are a puffskein! You eat anything."Peter glowered. "I am not a puffskein.""And you're adorable," James added with a Potter smile. "Like a puffskein.""You're just saying that to make me feel better!" Peter grumbled. James just shrugged. "Fine, if—if I'm a puffskein, you're a flobberworm."James snorted inward and then pressed mucus out from his lips."EWWWWWW!" Peter and Remus both squealed, scattering as James ran towards them, his snot dropping down. Remus crashed against Sirius who was laughing, watching as James chased Peter around. Then both boys ran right into a a group of Hufflepuff girls turning the corner, James, Peter, and multiple Hufflepuffs falling to the floor. There were a lot of shrieks, annoyed sounds, and some giggles.Then one of the girls screamed when she got up. "WHAT IS ON MY ARM?!" she demanded, staring in horror at a glistening patch on her robes sleeve."Um." James wiped his mouth off. "Flobberworm mucus," he said quickly. Sirius snorted and bent forward, pressing his face against Remus's shoulder to suppress the laughter. Remus pressed his lips tight together, trying not to laugh as well."THAT'S SO DISGUSTING!" she screamed, whirling on James while the other girls in the group shrieked with disgust. "You're so GROSS! What is WRONG with you?!""I didn't do nothing, you're the one who turned the corner without looking!" James grumbled."I'm not the one walking around with flobberworm mucus!" she snapped back. She wiped the snot onto James's arm then stormed off, her friends following, all of them shooting dirty looks over their shoulders.James blew a raspberry then he and Peter returned to Sirius and Remus. "Honestly." James tugged at his robes, straightening them out. "Girls."Sirius gave a slight gasp. "Girls!" he hissed out then took a few long strides after them. "HEY!" he called out, hands cupped around his mouth. The girls stopped and turned around, looking down their noses at him. "Are you third years or fourth?""Third," said one."Oh. Never mind." He flapped his hand dismissively. "Carry on.""What was that about?" Pete asked.Sirius jammed his hands in his pockets, grinning. "I need a fourth year girl.""Why?" James demanded."To ask me to the dance!"James and Remus both snorted while Peter's mouth hung open."Okay, you really think a fourth year is going to ask you to the dance?" James asked while Remus turned his laughter into a cough.Sirius was glaring at Remus. "Yes! I mean come on." He flourished his arms. "I'm gorgeous. And I'm turning thirteen tomorrow, so I'm practically a fourth year anyway.""In two years," Remus muttered."At least I look thirteen and not ten."Remus scoffed, face flaming up. "I look twelve, I'm merely... small.""You know, Remus is the one out of us that has the most 'sperience with girls," Peter pointed out. All three of them just stared at him. "What? He does. He talks to Evans all the times, and hangs out with Colgate and Inkwood, and there's girls in his study group. I mean, he's practically dating Evans.""That's true," James said."Is not!" Remus snapped, face going even hotter. "We're not—it's not—we aren't—""Evans isn't a fourth year girl," Sirius said."No!" James gasped, mock shock.Sirius rolled his eyes. "Look, my point is, to go to the dance you need to get a fourth year girl to ask and out of all of us here I think I'm the most likely candidate.""I could probably get a fourth year girl to ask me to the dance," James protested. "I'm on the team now. Girls go nuts over that.""You've got a point there," Sirius said, sounding a little jealous."But I don't want to. The dance sounds so boring. I mean, the only reason I'd go is to prank people, and if none of you are there even that's not as fun. Anyway, the dance is forever away. We've got loads more important things! Like your birthday tomorrow, then the Quidditch game next week!""Oh!" Remus said, remembering something. "Er, I forgot that I need to take an exam with Professor Prewett Saturday," he explained. "With everything that's happened I put it in the back of my mind and... I haven't studied. Oh, Merlin, I—I haven't studied! I-I didn't think I'd be here." Panic began to set in, his hands flying to his face. He hadn't done a stitch of studying for this and it was barely forty-eight hours away!"Snap out of it!" James said, grabbing Remus by the shoulders. "Isn't it a first year exam?" Remus looked up into his face and nodded. "Well, there you go. You'll do fine.""Yeah, you could probably pass a third year exam without any studying," Peter said."You're not going to skip birthday stuff tomorrow for studying, are you?" Sirius asked, forehead wrinkling."N—no of course not," Remus promised, wishing (a little) that he could. "I mean, I have study group but we're celebrating in the evening after, right? Yes, that will work out. I can study plenty today, and a little tomorrow in the day, and on Saturday morning."Sirius put his arm around Remus's shoulder. "Good, because my birthday would suck without you." He gave Remus a noogie and Remus yelped, flailing, struggling to get away. He finally managed and stumbled back, fixing his hair while Sirius smirked."How'd you like it if I messed your hair up?" Remus demanded, not particularly put out because Sirius doing this to him knowing what he was felt really comforting."You're too short," Sirius teased."Oh. Oh." Remus got his wand out, waving it a little. "I seem to remember messing up your hair pretty bad last month."Sirius's eyes went huge and his hands went up to protect his hair. "Don't you dare curl my hair!""Come here—""NO! LUPIN GO AWAY!""COME HERE, BLACK!"Remus chased him down the hall, shooting out the curling hair spell but purposely missing. Sirius yelled obscenities as well as threats towards Remus's fingers if he managed; Remus heard loud, heavy footsteps and knew Hagrid was approaching but didn't manage to get a warning out before Sirius barreled headfirst against the groundskeeper. Sirius tumbled backwards as Remus came to a screeching halt."Yer not supposed to be running in the halls," Hagrid said, reaching down to pick Sirius up from the floor."Um, yeah, I uh, saw something that scared me," Sirius said awkwardly."What was it?" Hagrid asked."Um. A... spider. Yeah, a huge spider."Remus thought Hagrid would just laugh but to his surprise Hagrid actually seemed a little... nervous? "Giant spider? How big?""Huge!" Sirius said, spreading his arms arm."Where did yeh see it?" Hagrid asked."Back there." Sirius pointed down the corridor.His response wasn't what Hagrid seemed to be expecting as his nervousness dissipated and he straightened up a bit; whatever he had been worried about was now gone. "Right. I'll let yeh off this time but if I catch yeh running in the school again yeh'll be in trouble.""Yes sir," Sirius said. Hagrid gave the others a curious glance then headed out, mumbling to himself about spiders. Sirius whirled around, obviously suppressing laughter. "Oops."Peter was still looking after Hagrid. "What was that about?""Me running into him?" Sirius asked, brushing himself off from his fall."No, the—the weirdness. You noticed that too, right?" Peter looked at Sirius with concern."I did," Remus promised, and Peter gave a relieved sigh.James nodded as they began walking again, returning to their journey to the dorms which had been derailed twice now. "Yeah, it was kinda like he actually believed the whole giant spider thing. That was weird."Sirius put his hands in his pockets, shrugging. "Maybe the rumors of giant spiders around here is true.""Hagrid knows the most about the forest," James agreed.Remus moaned, smacking his forehead. He wondered if they ever paid any kind of attention, or retained anything they learned beyond offensive spells, or spells they could use for pranks. "I've said before, Acromantula are not found in Europe." Though he had to admit, Hagrid sure had acted weird about it./\/\/\/\/\That night Remus didn't go to Quidditch practice; he stayed in the dorm, under his bed, needing to be alone. The others didn't really bother him about it, nor did they try too hard when they came back to get him to hang out with them. They seemed to understand he was really overwhelmed and just needed some space. So he read, and for some reason kept thinking about Professor Prewett dressed up like a pirate; the image kept coming back into his head, disrupting his reading, until he gave up and took a nap. He thought he also dreamed about Prewett as a pirate but when he woke up he figured it was just misremembering things.Friday went fairly typical for the most part, with a morning full of classes. Potions was awful for Remus, they were using some smelly ingredients that burned his nose and made his eyes water. They were working alone too, which meant Remus got a really poor grade instead of a kinda poor grade. At least Charms went well. They were working on the freezing charm, immobilizing things. Flitwick lectured about it then gave everyone boxes with a beetle.Remus looked down at the little shiny beetle scuttling around and took in a deep breath, drawing on his inner self. This was one of the spells he had practiced before although never with a living creature, so he wasn't sure if it would work. "Immobulus!" The beetle immediately froze."Very good, Mr. Lupin, five points to Gryffindor," Flitwick said, and Remus beamed. Flitwick had him practice on the beetle a few more times, then upgraded him to a large spider, then a frog, a mouse; Remus froze them all. By the time class was dismissed he had been freezing a rabbit with no issue while most everyone else was still on the beetle. Lily had been starting the frog, while James and Magpie were on the large spiders."You are amazing!" James said, throwing an arm around Remus as they left class. "If the class was any longer you'd be freezing elephants.""Could you freeze a person?" Pete asked."Probably not yet," Remus admitted, "though I imagine that is what we're working towards. We—"Sirius pushed his way between James and Remus, arms around both of them. "Let's talk about something more fun like the fact I actually read some of our book and the next spell coming up is the tickling charm!"'What are you doing, reading ahead?" James asked, elbowing him. "Turning into Remus?"Sirius snorted. "Yeah right." He let go of them to rummage around in his bag, producing the Charms book. "I was doodling. See?" He opened it up to the tickling charm, and on the image of the wizard doubled over clutching his stomach supposed to be laughing, Sirius drew to make it look like the guy was vomiting."That's so gross!" Peter whined."That is disgusting," agreed Remus."Ric-tu-sempa," Sirius read out then pushed his book into James's hands, getting his wand out. "Rictasempera!" he exclaimed, pointing his wand at Peter who squeaked and dove behind Remus."You're not supposed to be using magic in the corridors," Colgate called out from down the hall where she was walking with Lily and Inkwood.Sirius rolled his eyes. "Riccosemper!" he said, pointing at Colgate.Lily just raised her eyebrows. "Right. You read it out two seconds ago and already forgot."Sirius crinkled his nose up and flourished his wand again. "Rictersempa."Remus lowered Sirius's arm, reminding him how much trouble he could get in with so many people around and did he want to get detention on his birthday? Sirius tucked his wand away, and the four Marauders headed to the Great Hall. They didn't have any intention of staying; instead they gathered up some food to take outside. It was kinda chilly but the sun was bright so sitting on the grounds wasn't too cold. They ate, chattered, threw food at each other, tossed food into the lake for the squid, then questioned Sirius what it was like being an Actual and Proper Teenager."No different," Sirius sighed, stretching his legs out, and the three others frowned. "I mean, I woke up expecting to feel different but I don't.""That's disappointing," muttered Peter, breaking up a bit of bread into tiny little pieces."Oh, very disappointing," said Sirius as he propped himself back against his elbows, tipping his head up towards the sun. "Everything just feels so... confusing, you know? I was hoping maybe I'd figure something out today. Just, wake up and be oh! Or at least something changed. But no, it's the same stupid everything I had yesterday." He looked down at his body with a rather disgusted face."What happened to Mr. Most-Beautiful-Best-Looking-Taking-A-Fourth-Year-Out?" teased James.Sirius let out a long sigh then moved his arms so he could flop completely back onto the grass. "I am very good looking. Not saying I'm not. Just... I expected... you know... something different?""What?" Peter asked.Sirius actually began to look embarrassed. "You know. Things.""What things?" Remus asked."Things!" Sirius was actually turning pink now."Things," James echoed, confused. "Just... things."Sirius sat upright, face beet red. "My cock, all right? I thought I'd be bigger! Okay? HAPPY NOW?!"Remus ducked his head low, quickly shoving the remainder of his sandwich in his mouth to stop from laughing because he knew if he allowed even the slightest giggle out Sirius would be extremely hurt, but instead he thought he might end up choking himself. Peter snorted and stuffed part of his robes into his mouth, while James outright laughed."SHUT! UP!" Sirius grabbed a handful of crisps and threw them at James."We are gonna be learning the engorging charm soon," Peter said, trying hard not to bust up saying this.Sirius screeched with rage and tackled a screaming Peter, pinning him down while he dumped his drink down Peter's shirt, while Remus actually did begin choking hard on his sandwich; James scrambled over to whack him on the back until he spit it out. Remus took in a deep gasp of air then began laughing, falling backwards, pulling his vest up to cover his face while he rolled back and forth."NO!" he cried out, still laughing, as Sirius grabbed his ankles and began dragging him towards the lake. "NONONO!" He began kicking and flailing, still laughing. "I'M SORRRRRYYYYY! I WAS LAUGHING AT WHAT PETER SAID! NOT YOU!" Sirius stopped pulling and Remus rolled over, pressing his hands against his face now, trying to stop from laughing."I hate you all!" Sirius grumbled. "Last time I share something personal with you!""Sorry, sorry!" James wheezed, slapping Sirius on the back. "I am, mate. I get you. I think we just weren't... expecting... that.""Mmhm.""I am sorry too!" Peter said."Me too," Remus said, muffled since his hands were still on his face. "I'm sorry."James was right, Remus had not expected anything about penises. He remembered over the summer, his father trying to talk to him about... things. He wondered if their parents tried talking to them about that stuff. Then he considered Sirius's words and wondered about his own penis. He knew it would... change over time. It had changed. A lot. But. Was it supposed to get big-bigger? How big was it supposed to get? How big was he supposed to be? The only one he had to compare to was James who was the only one who would walk around unabashedly naked. Remus was smaller than James, he knew that, but hadn't really thought anything of it until now. Was he normal? Abnormal? Too small?There wasn't anyone he could ask though. He figured boys were supposed to talk to their dads but he cringed with absolute humiliation at the thought of asking his father questions about his genitalia. He cringed imagining talking to anyone about it, period! There were probably books. Were there books in the library? Not that he could ever check them out! Oh MERLIN! He went brilliant red picturing himself checking out a book about bodies with Farrow staring at him, judging him.Maybe I should sneak in with them, Remus thought as they got up, gathering their things, needing to head in to get to class, Sirius still complaining about how mean they were. He could find a book in Hogsmeade, and had the two galleons from winning that slime-licking bet with Sirius and James. But sneaking into Hogsmeade was so wrong! But he could NEVER in a MILLION years ask one of his friends to get a book.Remus twisted his fingers into the strap of his satchel, chewing at his bottom lip. Sneaking in was wrong. But... he felt very curious now, and wanted to get a book to help him maybe figure this out... of course... he did go into Hogsmeade all the time, technically... Would he be able to wait until the holidays and ask his parents to take him to a bookstore? That was a month and a half away! Plus his parents would want to know where he got the money and probably what he bought.Perhaps... I should... sneak in...Just to the bookstore, that's all.That wouldn't be too awful... would it?/\/\/\/\/\The Marauders stayed up super late that night. James made an excursion to the kitchens to bring back some cake and at around eleven pm they sat in the common room singing 'For He's A Jolly Good Fellow' (a couple of the older students still awake also sang), then Sirius blew out the candles while they cheered, then they dug into the slices with gusto, Remus especially since according to Madame Pomfrey he still needed to gain weight from what happened during his last transformation; he had seen her the night before and she was disappointed that he wasn't back to where he had been before, so he was trying his best to stuff his face. Once the cake was gone it was time for presents.Sirius decided to open Regulus's present first. Regulus had approached him during supper, shoving a wrapped present into his hands before hurrying back to the Slytherin table. The present turned out to be a really nice pair of winter boots; thankfully Peter gave Sirius candy and a framed photo of the four Marauders because it made Remus feel a little better about giving him something handmade though he still felt ill when Sirius opened up his."Gryffindor hat!" he exclaimed, pulling it on. "And some chocolate. Thanks, Remy!"Remus had no intention of admitting he had made the hat himself but James took the hat and began turning it round and round. "Where'd you get this? I like the lion paw on the front."Remus mumbled incoherently."What?""I—I m-m-made it," he whispered."You made it?" Peter asked, a little surprised.Remus nodded. "I w-was a little bored in the summer so—so Mum taught me to knit." He shrugged and bowed his head so his hair covered his face, trying to act like he didn't really care even though he did definitely care whether or not they thought it was pathetic of him."That's so neat!" James exclaimed."I can't believe you can do stuff like this," said Sirius, taking his hat back."Remus, that's super!" Peter said.Remus glanced up, expecting amusement in their faces but they looked earnest. "You don't think it's dumb?""No!" Sirius yanked the hat back on and struck a pose. "It makes it even more better knowing you actually made it.""You even did the lion paw?" James asked. Remus nodded again. "Whoa. Didn't know you had talent like that!"Remus blushed, pulling more hair over his face. "Th—thank you." It felt super good they were impressed. Even better, they didn't think it was dumb!Sirius's last present was from James, and it was a bunch of stuff. Some Montrose Magpies posters, a red paisley shirt with a super pointy collar, brightly patterned socks, a set of very nice paints, a new deck of cards, a jar of Sleekeazy's Hair Potion, and a new Gryffindor style satchel for school. It was a lot of nice stuff and made Remus feel a little awkward for not doing more, but then again James did have a lot of money and Remus did not, and Sirius loved the hat so he supposed it was all right."Be right back!" Sirius said, dashing up the stairs. He reappeared a moment later in his new shirt and socks (and still had the hat on). He flopped back down, sticking his feet out and wriggling his toes. "Thank you guys for everything." He picked up the framed photo Peter gave him. "I think this is the best picture of us ever."Peter, who had been looking about as awkward as Remus felt, smiled. "I thought so too. I'm glad you like it.""I love it." Sirius looked back up, grinning, entire face shining with happiness. "You guys are so amazing. I dunno what I'd do without you. This is probably my best birthday ever. I thought last year's was good but..." He glanced at Remus. "This year you're here too, and we're the Marauders. So it's even better."They poured butterbeer and clinked their glasses together, cheering Sirius. After some more jokes and laughter, Sirius ripped into the new deck of cards and they began playing Jarvey. Once the common room emptied they moved closer to the fireplace and James turned on the radio that was always on the mantle. He and Sirius began dancing while Peter and Remus continued playing cards until the others pulled them to their feet. Remus protested but Sirius had a death grip on his wrist and he was unable to escape. Sirius spun him around and tried to get him to boogie."I'm not good!" Remus whined as he crashed back into Peter.Peter took over holding his arms, trying to get him to move. "It's easy though. Even I can dance. Okay, um, not so well, but still.""You've danced before," James pointed out."Maybe once..." Peter bumped his hip against him and Remus stumbled back, trying not to make it too dramatic looking. "Owwwww I think I twisted my ankle!" Remus pulled away, collapsing back onto the sofa, leaning down to rub his ankle.James folded his arms. He glanced around then bent in to whisper, "Nice try but you already told us you heal up."Remus scowled. "Drat. Was hoping you forgot." They couldn't remember their homework assignment from five minutes ago but they could remember that?"Aw, come on, Brains!" Sirius said, spinning in wild circles, hair flying out. "What if there's another dance when we're old enough to go?""Um, I won't go," Remus muttered, hunkering down onto the couch, folding his limbs as close to his body as he could get them in order to prevent his friends from hauling him back to his feet.He still didn't get the whole dance thing. Even if he could dance he wouldn't want to go! If it was just something where he could go with his friends that'd be a bit different. He could see himself going with one of the Marauders. But asking a girl to the dance? Ugh. He thought back to the Slug Club Christmas party, where Lily had begged him to go and as it turned out she had assumed it would be a dancing sort of party and she had wanted Remus to go so she'd have someone to dance with. It had really freaked him out a bit when Lily confessed that to him because even dancing with Lily seemed... itchy. Why couldn't he go with a guy? He thought he'd prefer Sirius but knew Sirius wanted to go with a girl, so why couldn't he just go with James or Peter? That'd be so much easier. And nicer.

Author's Note: Hey everyone! So I thought it'd be fun to start a discord server! It's for Shifting Lines but it's also a place to just hang out in. Show off art projects, talk about whatever, share moments in video games, etc, etc. I'll also be posting sneak peeks and stuff :) It's already open so if you wanna come join us I posted the link on my profile (it might take a few minutes for it to show up), or you can leave a message and I'll PM the link to you (though again, I cannot reply to guest accounts). I hope to see you there! Or not haha that's fine too! It can get pretty chaotic in there so it's 100% fine if you just want to lurk and mute any of the channels not related to the story! Don't feel obliged to chat if you don't want to!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus slept in Saturday morning. By the time he woke up Sirius was already off in detention, and James and Peter were off at James's practice. After a quick breakfast, Remus went to the library for some more cramming before his exam and soon heard footsteps approaching. He looked up, smiling at the sight of Aegis."M-morning.""Good morning," Aegis replied. "Mind if I join you?""Not at all." Remus moved his books to make some room.Aegis sat down next to him, spreading his own things out. "Are you doing better?""Better?" Remus was a little confused.Aegis tilted his head. "You were quite unwell last week. I know you were considering the possibility of needing to drop out."Remus blushed, realizing he hadn't really spoken to Aegis about his 'decision'. The past few days had been so strange and long, everything seemed blurry. "I—I think I just had a bad week, last week. I have b-been doing a lot better.""That is so good to hear. So you're staying?""Yeah, I th-think so," he said, trying not to feel guilty. "I guess if I g-get a really bad relapse again I might but... as of right now I'm f-feeling good."Aegis smiled. "That's great. I'm glad you're not leaving. School would be infinitely less pleasant without you. Are you going to look back into those secret passages again since you're doing better?""Ooh." Remus perked up, realizing he'd be able to go back to researching the pits! "Definitely. I m-mean, not at the moment, but I will perhaps tomorrow. If you were interested in, um, sti-still helping—""Of course," Aegis replied, not even waiting for Remus to finish his sentence. "They've been on my mind a lot. Actually, I've been looking a little more into them on my own." His cheeks went faintly pink at this confession. "I might have found something.""You did? What?"Aegis folded his arms on the table and bent in. "Is it on the southern side of the castle?"Remus furrowed his brow, squinting, trying to imagine the passages. "Erm. I... I think so...? Why?""There is a section of castle on that side with no rooms, it's solid stone—at least, that's what it supposedly is. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a raised foundation or not. It seems strange that they would simply not use a section of the castle for rooms..."Remus stared at Aegis. "That d-doesn't make any sense at all.""That's what I thought too. I got to thinking perhaps it isn't so-called 'raised foundation' but something previous generations did, or even the founders." Aegis looked over his shoulder then bent in so close their faces were hardly an inch apart. "Have you heard about Slytherin's secret chamber?"Remus's eyes went huge. Of course he had! Anyone who read about Hogwarts history knew. "You th-think...?""I don't think the passages are, however perhaps they are above it."Remus breathed slowly, eyes locked on Aegis's blue ones. The fabled Chamber of Secrets? It sounded... preposterous. However... why else would there be such a large portion of the castle sealed off? He pictured the passages again, the deep pits. Had someone been blasting through the floor to find an entrance? "Isn't the Chamber in the dungeons, though?"Aegis pulled back, shrugging. "Supposedly. However, nobody knows for sure."Remus swallowed, adventure and excitement creeping through his body. "All right, we n-need to figure out exactly what section of the castle is blocked off and if it's c-close or at where the pits are."Aegis grinned. "After lunch?""Yes! Oh. Oh, no, I—I can't," Remus moaned, forgetting entirely why he had come to the library in the first place! "I have a makeup exam with P-Professor Prewett at one. It sh-shouldn't last long though. Maybe afterwards we c-can?""That is fine with me," Aegis said, settling fully back in his seat. "A makeup exam? From when you were sick?""Er. N—not exactly." Remus looked down at the book in front of him, feeling embarrassed. He had told Lily and the Marauders, and thought he should tell Aegis, so he did. He told him the same thing he told Lily: that Dedenne hated his father, was unfair to him, gave him purposefully terrible grades, etc, etc. He told him about Prewett wanting to help him fix things, so he was retaking the first year exams. "This one would b-be the ones before the Easter holidays, and—and on the eighteenth I'll be t-taking the end-of-year ones.'Aegis listened to all of this with a serious face, nodding. When Remus finished talking he clapped his hands a couple times. "That's so good of him! I like Professor Prewett. It makes me glad that he's being so kind. Although it's distressing to hear how Professor Dedenne treated you. That makes me so angry. How come you never went to anyone about it?""Er." He ducked his head low, pretending to focus on notes he was taking, carefully scratching his quill along the parchment. "It just... I—I thought... I mean, she was a t-teacher, and I...""You can stand up for others but you cannot stand up for yourself," Aegis said flatly.Remus scowled. "No! Th-that's not—I—I can—I can st-stand up for my—myself! I can—I—I... can't... stand up for myself. No. You're right."Aegis studied him for several seconds then, "You are one of the bravest Gryffindors I know, yet quite timid."Remus laughed at that, how true it was; at least the second part. Sometimes the first part. "That's true.""You are worthy," Aegis said, words striking Remus's chest. "I know... it can be... very easy to believe otherwise... especially when others make you feel that way... but you are."Remus suspected it wasn't just Remus Aegis was talking about. "Do you feel that way about yourself?" he inquired, remembering how anxious Aegis had been after the interaction with Malfoy.Aegis turned his head away, looking down at the book he had on the table in front of him, his slender shoulders stiff under his weekend clothing; a pale blue button-up that nearly matched his eyes, and white pants that Remus couldn't figure out he kept so pristine and clean."I've got... things... against me," Aegis said slowly, touching the open page of the book, tracing along the picture. "It's difficult to see myself in a positive light.""I—I'm sorry, I didn't—I shouldn't have asked."Aegis smiled but kept looking at the book. "It's all right. I suppose the easiest way to explain is it is similar to the problems Mr. Black has. Unfortunate bloodlines." He finally glanced back up. "Has he told you? About me?""Sirius?" Remus frowned. "No. I know he doesn't l-like you... but he's never said anything. I really don't know much about families, I don't know about wh—the Silverlockes, what... that might mean or—""Oh! No, not the Silverlockes," Aegis said quickly. "They're wonderful. I love that part of my family dearly. I don't think you've met my cousin, have you?" Remus shook his head. "You should meet her. She's a little like you, absolutely brilliant, one of the top in her year; a year ahead of us, she's—she's a third year. You'd like her. Actually, I was thinking perhaps she could come in to study group one evening when next term starts, to talk about the electives... to sort of... help us out, give us advice.""That'd be great," Remus said. "I've been anxious about them.""Same. On the bright side, the electives are shared between all houses so if we take the same classes we'd be together." Aegis smiled. "Do you have any idea of what you'd like?""Ugh, n-not yet. I dunno." He tugged at the parchment, tearing a little corner off. "They all sound so interesting. I—I know my friends are considering Muggle Studies."Aegis's eyebrows arched high. "Misters Black and Potter? Muggle Studies?"Remus rolled his eyes. "It's rumored to be the softest, easiest elective.""Ah. All right, yes, that makes more sense." They both laughed at that. "Are you considering it as well?"Remus sighed, stretching his arms out across the table, dropping his cheek against his arms. "I don't know. Yes? Not just to—to be with them but because I-I think it'd be really fascinating, although I was raised fairly Muggle.""You're half-and-half, correct?" Aegis asked and Remus nodded. "I thought that's what I heard. Er, unfortunately, part of being in Slytherin means hearing alllll about bloodlines," he went on to explain, sounding frustrated.Remus figured changing the subject would be the best course. "What electives are you considering?""Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, Care of Magical Creatures, probably," he answered. "We're only supposed to take two though.""Yeah..." Remus thought that wasn't fair, having to only pick two. He wanted all of them! "Ancient Runes really sounds fun."Aegis's eyes lit up. "I think so too! That's what my Uncle Minos does, at the Ministry. Works with runes. Pandora—my cousin—she takes the class. She loves it.""If we both take it then at least we'd have each other if none of our other friends take it," said Remus, then realized he wasn't sure who Aegis was friends with in Slytherin."That would be wonderful," Aegis said, then covered his mouth. "I'm keeping you from studying for your test. I'm so sorry—""Oh, it's—it's okay." Remus had forgotten again about it. "I still have..." He twisted in his seat, trying to find a clock.Aegis checked his watch. "It's eleven-thirty.""An hour and a half. I had a big breakfast, so I can skip lunch.""You should not skip meals!" Aegis chided."I ate at a-around an hour ago," he explained, and Aegis looked relieved. "Should we meet up somewhere at maybe..." He thought of his first exam with Prewett. "Two-thirty?" He doubted he'd even need an hour, but wanted extra time to be sure. Aegis agreed, and they made plans to meet up in the entrance hall to do some sleuthing./\/\/\/\/\Remus got out of his exam by one-forty, with a passing grade of 112%. James's practice was almost over however since he was meeting Aegis at two-thirty he opted to just wait in the entrance hall, reading. At two-ten the Marauders came in, James swaggering in his Quidditch uniform since this was the first time he wore it for anything other than showing off."How'd the exam go?" James asked, throwing himself onto the bench next to Remus."Very good, I passed," Remus said. "How did practice go?""Really good!" James grinned, wiping sweat off his forehead. "I'm so excited for next week, and so scared.""You'll do amazing," Peter said. "I mean, you're the best ever."James beamed, messing up his sweaty hair. "I don't know if best ever buuuuut I am pretty good. For a second year. I mean, I'm just gonna keep getting better.""You're gonna make it on a professional team," Peter said."James, I can see your head getting bigger as we speak," Sirius teased, dancing away as James kicked at him. "So, any plans for the day?""It's kinda nice out, we could go to Fort Dragon," suggested Peter."I—I can't," Remus said and everyone looked at him. "I'm meeting Aegis in fifteen minutes, to... to research some things." He wasn't sure how they'd feel if he told them he was researching the pits passage with Aegis.Sirius gave him a rather cutting look. "You're spending the day with a Slytherin?" He sounded very suspicious, and a touch unhappy.Remus tried to give him a fierce glare but as soon as their eyes met Sirius glanced away. "Yeah. He's my friend." Sirius folded his arms, not saying anything else. "I'm not sure how long we'll be so... I guess I'll try to find you when we're done." He shifted in his seat, getting a weird feeling from Sirius. "Are you all right?" he asked."Mm, yeah, fine," Sirius muttered, looking down at his feet as he scuffed at the floor.Remus looked at James and Peter, both whom shrugged. They weren't sure what had gotten Sirius's wand in a knot either. Was it really only because Remus was hanging out with a Slytherin? "Okay. I, um, g—guess I'll see you guys later then."The other Marauders headed off, James casting a puzzled expression back at Remus who shrugged in return. Once they were gone he stretched his legs out and waited for about five more minutes before Aegis showed up, hauling a rather large book as he jogged over to where Remus sat."I checked this out," he said, dropping the book on the bench and sitting down. Hogwarts, A History."We've read through this before and d-didn't find out anything about the—" Remus paused, remembering there were others wandering around the entrance hall, and dropped his voice low, "—passage."Aegis pulled the book into his lap, flipping through it. "I did not check it out for that, I checked it out for this." He found the page he wanted and pushed the book over to Remus.The legend of the Chamber of Secrets. Remus read through it quickly, mostly to remind himself of what the book said as he had read it multiple times before. He hadn't paid much attention to this though. "You really think it might be what it—it is?" he whispered, shutting the book.Aegis slid closer, tilting his head in. "The Chamber's been opened before.""What?!" Remus asked loudly then clapped his hand over his mouth as a few students looked his way. "Erm, c—come on, let's go somewhere more private." They went down several corridors until Remus opened up a secret passageway, and they climbed in. "Lumos." They settled down, and Aegis opened the book back up to the legend. "All right, wh-when was it opened?""That, I'm not too sure of," Aegis sighed, tucking his long blonde hair behind his ear as he bent in to look at the words. His hair just fell forward, brushing against the pages. "It's merely rumors. Some of the older students saying things that could just be made up to make themselves look cooler. They say it was opened before, and a Muggleborn was murdered."Remus wrapped his arms around his knees. "It's just a legend so it can't have been opened.""I don't know. Creating a huge chamber and sealing up a monster that kills Muggleborns seems like something Slytherin would have done," Aegis murmured, still studying the pages."Well... why don't we nose around and try to figure out what the passage is above?" Remus said, resting his chin on his arms. "I... guess I should sh—show you the p-passages, then, and we can go from there."Aegis tried to hide how excited he was. "You don't need to, I understand your friends would be distraught if you revealed them to me."Remus blew some hair from his face, knowing he was right. "Who's... to say... I showed you and you didn't find them on your own?"Aegis snorted, and choked a little. "You're willing to lie?""Not lie, merely... stretch the truth. A lot."Aegis tucked the book into his bag and they headed out, Remus figuring the best option would be the entrance in the trophy room. As they walked they discussed the best way to figure out how to figure out exactly what the passages were above. By the time they reached the trophy room they decided since neither of them knew any measuring spells and they didn't want to take the time to research them, the easiest thing would be to use their own steps to count. But first, the passages."Beati pacifici," Remus said, and Scrumgour's portrait moved aside.They both lit up their wands as soon as the portrait closed behind them, heading down the corridor until they got to the first bit. Aegis knelt down, reaching his arm down as far as it would go. "I wish there were a way for us to go down there. I assume you used Mr. Potter's broom?""Mmhm." Remus didn't get too close to the edge. He had been down one of them before but it didn't stop the creepy, twisty feeling in his stomach. "They got down... well, the one we went d-down seemed t-to go down a floor and a half.""And it was only stone?""Yes.""Fascinating." Aegis stood up, hands on his hips. "It looks blasted. It does not seem as though it were... naturally made." He crouched back down and ran his fingers along the edge. "It's rough, and broken. It was not built this way."After he studied the edge for another moment he stood up, tucking his wand into his pocket. Remus got out his quill and some parchment as Aegis stood with his back to the pit. "Ready?""Let's d-do it."Aegis began walking, placing his feet directly in front of the other, counting as he went. He went slow and careful while Remus scratched marks for each step. It took a lot to reach the portrait and they counted the marks, just to double check, then scrambled out into the trophy room. Aegis began doing the same, walking to the wall by the door."This is going to take forever!" Aegis moaned once they got those numbers recorded. "We have to count to the stairs, too.""I know," Remus murmured, circling the two numbers, something nagging at his brain. He looked up, brow furrowed as he stared at the distant window. "H... hold on." He handed the parchment to Aegis then ran across the trophy room to the windows, leaning out, ignoring the dizzying feeling. "OH! OH!" he shouted, spinning around."What is it?""C—come on, I'll show you! It's s-so obvious! I'm so stupid!" He grabbed Aegis's hand without thinking and began pulling him along until he realized, and quickly let go. Aegis hadn't seemed bothered by it, but Remus felt absolutely awful. He hardly knew Aegis, and physically touching him was still squidgy. The familiar thoughts of, you're a monster, you touched him and you're a monster rose up in his head, and he felt nauseated.They ran down the hallway, Remus in the lead until he tripped and crashed into the ground. Aegis yelped but Remus promised he was fine, getting up, ignoring the pain in his elbow where he had struck the stone hard. He reiterated that he was fine then kept going, weaving through the school until they burst outside."Where are we going?" Aegis asked as he dogged Remus's fast steps."You'll see!" He ran around the castle (tripping twice more) then pointed. "There!"They stood panting, Aegis bending forward, hands on his thighs. "All right?""That's the south-east side of the castle, right? Those windows look into the—the trophy room?""Uh-huh?"Remus gestured. "It's rock. It's not the castle! The—the third floor, look!" He pointed to where the castle jutted out over rocks. "The third floor starts on the rock. It's not built over part of the castle, it's built over part of the mountain and they didn't—didn't get rid of the mountain. There isn't any—any floors underneath, only mountain! Those pits, they're—they're going down into the mountain!"Aegis studied the castle, still panting. "That is absolutely brilliant. Although I suppose that kills my theory of the Chamber—""No it doesn't." Remus turned to face him. "Maybe Slytherin did put the Chamber there. In the mountain. Or—or maybe whoever blasted those pits was looking for the Chamber."Aegis pushed his hair back from his sweaty face. "That is a possibility. We need to find out when the passages were sealed off. Would the painting of Scrimgeour tell us?""Well, he w-was headmaster until 1909," Remus said, shivering now since it was pretty cold outside and he wasn't wearing a jacket. "So either they were sealed up around that time and his portrait was put there to g-guard, or they changed out the portrait guarding.""I think we should go ask him," said Aegis.They headed back to the trophy room but as soon as they reached the second floor they were interrupted by a couple of older Slytherins. "Hey, Silverlocke!"Aegis turned then a flash of fear crossed his face, very briefly. Remus looked back at the Slytherins, none of whom he recognized."What are you doing, hanging with a Gryffindor?" demanded one of them, folding his arms. "Aren't you enough of a disgrace?"Aegis just turned back around, walking forward. Remus hesitated then followed. The Slytherins followed too, both of them hurling insults."Hey, you walking away from us? You dare walk away from us? Think you're better than us? You're less, you're less, and scrabbling around with filthy half-bloods proves it. You pretend to be a Slytherin but you're not, you're nothing."Remus whirled back around, yanking his wand out which stopped them in their tracks. Aegis seized Remus's wrist. "Don't," he whispered.The Slytherins' laughter echoed down the hall as Aegis pulled him away. Remus followed, fuming with anger. He remembered Malfoy again, Sirius's distaste of Aegis, and what he had said that very morning, about 'unfortunate bloodlines', but not the Silverlocke part of his blood. He thought hard trying to remember if he saw Aegis ever spend time with anyone in particular... and couldn't. Not that he really paid much attention to Aegis's social life as they were in different houses so keeping tabs wasn't exactly easy, however Remus wondered if Aegis even had any friends in his own house.He knew if he asked Sirius, Sirius would tell him about whatever the bloodline thing meant, but he didn't want to go behind Aegis's back. Nor did he want to ask Aegis directly despite burning curiosity. So, he didn't say anything as they returned to the trophy room."Sorry f-for trying to attack them," he finally said as they approached Scrimgeour's portrait."It is all right," Aegis replied. "I appreciate it."Scrimgeour informed them he was painted in 1906 and hung up in 1910. As far as he knew another painting had guarded the passage beforehand so he had no idea when it was sealed off, as far as he knew it had been sealed off from the get go. Remus and Aegis thanked him then went went into the passage, going to that first pit to examine the edges again as they discussed everything."There are some pots and paintings throughout the corridors," Remus said, "and maybe we can date the p-passageway based on them. If th—they're, say, f-fifteenth century we know the p-passage was open until at l-least then."Aegis raised his eyebrows. "Are you able to that?""Errr... I m—mean, um, I c-can't really do th—that myself," he admitted, tugging at his sleeve. "But I can do r-research.""We," Aegis said and Remus grinned.It was pretty much time for supper, and they didn't really have anything more to do with the passages so they went to the Great Hall, both of them feeling very good about all they accomplished. It hadn't been too much, but he was very intrigued at the idea of the Chamber even if he wasn't sure whether it existed or not. It was definitely a mystery.

Loud noises dragged Remus out of his sleep in the morning. He moaned and tried to bury his head under his pillow then gave up, yanking his curtains open. He complained about being woken up so early and James—bouncing on his bed—began laughing, stating it was nearly eleven. Remus blinked a few times then squinted at the clock. 10:47am."Still early," he grumbled, rubbing his eyes."Your hair's worse than James's," Sirius teased."Didn't think possible," Remus yawned, stretching his arms out. He stretched them way above his head, his shirt riding up a little, and he thought he heard Sirius make a weird noise but when he finished stretching Sirius was back to reading his comic book. He must made the weird noise at whatever was going on there. "Did you guys eat already?""Uh-huh," Peter said. "You've seemed so tired all weekend we thought you should sleep in.""Oh. Er, thank you, I appreciate that." He got out of bed, getting his bag of toiletries, then rummaged through his wardrobe for some clean clothes which didn't take long since he hardly had any clothes (90% of the wardrobe, which he shared with Sirius, was full of Sirius's clothes). "Sirius did... you put dirty socks back in this drawer?" he asked, crinkling his nose up."Maybe. Why?""It stinks."Sirius strolled over and bent down, sniffing at the drawer. "No it doesn't."Remus pushed his hand way to the back and yanked out the offensive pieces of clothing, brandishing them. They were clearly dirty. "Hidden, you hid them."Sirius took them, grinning sheepishly. "I—er, I forgot about them is all." He sniffed at the socks then tossed them in the laundry bin. "Whoops."How can someone so beautiful be so disgusting? Remus wondered as he went to the bathroom to get ready for the day. Then again, James and Peter did stuff like that. He wondered if he should start wearing dirty socks and throwing his undergarments on the floor to be more like them? But ugh no, that was gross and it stank! Maybe if he didn't have such a sensitive nose he'd be more inclined. After all, he left other stuff strewn about all the time...He trudged back into the dorm, immediately feeling Sirius staring at him. He glanced over and Sirius quickly looked away, as if he didn't want to be caught looking at Remus which was bizarre and sent a momentary flare of panic through Remus. Does he know? he thought then stopped in his tracks realizing, yes. He knew. They all knew. They knew! He was so shocked, he dropped his bag."You okay?" Peter asked, seeing that Remus was frozen in place."Whoa, Remy?" Sirius asked when Remus didn't say anything.Remus blinked as Peter poked him, coming back to reality. "I—I guess..." He shook his head and picked his bag back up. "Just... it's so weird to think you guys know. About my—you know what.""It's been almost two weeks," James said, bouncing on his bed again.Remus smiled at him, kneeling down on the floor, using going through his bag as an excuse but really it was because he was getting kinda dizzy, as well as overwhelmed. They knew, they knew. "Yes, and it's probably going to be two decades before I'm all right with you knowing.""You... aren't okay with us knowing?" Peter asked, sounding hurt."No. I mean. Sorta." He sighed, sitting back on his heels. "It's strange to me. I—I'm not... trying to say it's not okay. It's just going to take me a very long time to get used to it.""Well, when you're twenty-two you will be," James said then made a face. "I mean, thirty-two. I know what a decade is, don't look at me like that!"Remus pulled on CLEAN socks and his old, battered trainers, then left to eat. Peter went with him, hungry again since, in his words, he hadn't eaten much at breakfast."Could you help me with Astronomy?" Pete asked as soon as they sat down. "I'm having so much trouble, and I'm pretty sure Sirius was lying about what we're supposed to be doing."Remus eyed him. "What did Sirius say?""We're supposed to be doing an essay on Uranus," Peter said, and Remus snorted. "I thought we were supposed to be working on one about Pluto though. That's what I wrote. It's no good but that's what I wrote.""We are," Remus reassured him. "I'll look at it later."Peter slumped down, sighing with relief. "Merlin, I don't know what I'd do without you.""You'd do fine," he said then before Peter could argue explained, "You're good. You may not get things immediately but that does not change the fact you're a perfectly competent wizard.""I'm glad I have friends like you.""Me too. You're a super friend." Then an idea struck him. "Hey, could you possibly help me with a research project?""Me?" Peter was so surprised me dropped his spoon. "Me? Research? You want me?""Yes. I'd like to..." Remus dropped his voice and leaned across the table. "To... try and possibly figure out when the passages might have been sealed. The... pits?" Peter's mouth formed an O. "I was thinking you could perhaps take some photographs of the pots, and some of the paintings? I think if I can figure out the general time period of when those were made, I'll have a better of idea of when they were closed off, and having photos of them at hand will be an enormous help.""Oooh. Yes! Yeah, I—I can do it!" He straightened up, looking super excited. "You can figure out when things were made?""I am hoping I can.""That's so cool."After they were done eating, Remus decided he wanted to see if Lily wanted to do something since he hadn't spent much time with her lately. Peter left while Remus waited in the Great Hall reading until she showed up for lunch; she was quite ecstatic to spend the day with him, and admitted she had been feeling a little blue that he'd been so wrapped up with the Marauders lately, which made him feel guilty.Almost as soon as they left the Hall, though, Snape encountered them. He asked to talk to Lily for a moment and they went down a little ways from Remus, obviously assuming he was out of hearing. He sat down, getting a book out of his satchel to pretend to read while listening in. Snape wanted to spend the afternoon with Lily. She said she was sorry, but she made plans with Remus. Snape didn't really take too kindly to that."He's a Gryffindor, you can spend a lot more time with him than you can with me! We hardly get to spend time with one another," he complained bitterly."I haven't seen him much lately, outside class and study group—""That's not my fault."Lily scoffed. "Sev, I tried to hang out with you last week and you were busy, so why should I drop things if you can't—""I'm not saying drop everything when I have time, I know that's not fair. I don't ask to spend time together on the nights you do that study group thing. It's only you're not really doing anything important right now."Remus gripped his book tightly at that, frowning."I'm hanging out with Remus," she said flatly."Which can't you do after curfew when we're stuck in our common rooms? Please? I—I really need you right now."Lily was very quiet for a few seconds. "Did something happen?""Yes."Remus bit his bottom lip, waiting for Lily's reply. "Are you okay?""I... suppose."Lily sighed. "All right. Just a moment." Remus grit his teeth, trying not to look annoyed as Lily returned to him. "Hey, um, Remus?"He glanced up. "Yeah?""Um. Sev—he needs to talk to me about some things right now. Is it okay is we hang out later?"Remus closed his book. "Yeah. That's fine." He hoped he didn't sound too disappointed. "I'll see you around."Lily hesitated as he stood up then gave him a hug. "I'm sorry. He just needs a friend right now.""It's fine," he promised her, hugging back.He watched her walk off with Snape and could feel Snape's smugness. He glared at Snape's back then stormed off to the dorms, hoping to find his friends but of course Peter already told them he was hanging out with Lily so they weren't anywhere to be found. He moped around the dorms for a while then went to the library to work on his essays, feeling very grouchy, angry at Snape. He knew Snape had been lying just to get Lily to go with him!He very slowly got through one and a half essays then threw his quill down, unable to concentrate. He sat back in his chair, arms folded, glaring at the parchment in front of him. Maybe Snape really did need a friend. Maybe something awful happened and he needed to vent.Yeah, and maybe tomorrow the Ministry will announce werewolves are humans.Remus pushed all his stuff into his bag and stormed out of the library./\/\/\/\/\Remus did consider just hiding out in his dorm but knew that was absolutely petty, so he stayed in the common room for most the afternoon, reading a book, trying to ignore the noisiness of all the other students. It was a grey, chilly, damp sort of day so the common room was fairly crowded. He curled up in a corner armchair, focusing hard on the story (though at one point he overheard a quiet argument between two girls about one of their boyfriends cheating on her which was rather interesting).Eventually Lily came into the common room, glancing around. "Remus!" She hurried over, flinging herself into the chair next to his. "I'm glad I found you.""I wasn't sure how long you'd be so I thought I'd just wait here."Lily folded her arms over one of the chair's arms and rested her chin against them. "I appreciate it. I really am sorry.""It's all right." He picked at the edge of the book, trying hard not to sound snarky as he said, "Is Snape doing better?"Lily looked away. "Er, yes," she said in a voice that made Remus figure he was right, Snape had made up a bunch of Hippogriff poop to sway her. He wondered what she was thinking. "What do you want to do?"He didn't really have any idea and neither did she, so they wound up leaving the common room and wandering through the halls, talking about various things until they got on the subject of things they did as kids. Lily was taken aback when he said he spent most his time by himself, and he really hadn't played many games other than pretend. After more discussion they snuck into a classroom to swipe some chalk then went to a rarely used corridor where Lily drew a bunch of boxes, explaining the rules of hopscotch. As neither of them had anything to use as markers, Remus tore some parchment up, and transfigured little balls of paper into something sorta stone-line well enough to use.He sucked at hopscotch! It was difficult to balance on one leg and to hop forward on the same leg, so when his stone fell that way he usually ended up falling over. Lily was awesome, breezing through, hopping from foot to foot."Yeah, yeah, you have superior balance," he said and she stuck her tongue out at him, giggling. The next time she tried he flicked his wand out, making the stone slide to a different box. Lily flailed and fell over."I saw that!" she accused while he laughed. "Huh. That'd be an interesting twist to it! I wonder if there's a wizarding version of this?""What other games did you play?" Remus asked.Lily shrugged. "I dunno. Tag. Statues. Kick the can. Bulldog. Capture the flag." She spread her hands out. "Some of the more popular kids would play oranges and lemons, and a lot of them played kiss chase.""Kiss chase?!" Remus wrinkled his nose up. "Is it as awful as it sounds?""Probably!" she giggled. "Either all the boys or all the girls would be it, and to catch someone you'd have to kiss them. I never played because no one wanted me to join in, since I was considered a weird kid. None of the boys wanted to have to kiss me."Remus gagged. "Sounds disgusting." Though, that got him to thinking about things. Maybe he could ask Lily. "Can I ask you something?" He waited for her to nod then asked, "Do you—do you ever feel like some of your friends are... growing up more than you are?" He felt anxious asking this, regretting the words as soon as they came out of his mouth.Lily hummed for a moment, kicking at one of the markers they had made while she thought. "Yes. Why? Do you feel that way? Because, honestly, you're the most mature out of all your friends.""I—I'm not. That's the... the problem," he said and she gave him a curious look. "I mean." He should have just ended the conversation. Gone back to talking about kid games! "They sometimes do talk about—about girls. Cute girls.""Mmhm?" Remus shrugged, not saying anything else. "Is that a problem?" Lily asked."Well, you lot are always talking about boys. And—and Sirius wants to go to the dance, and sometimes they talk about stuff like that and..." He trailed off, ducking his head, feeling dumb."You don't?" she asked as she began picking up the markers, depositing them in her pockets. They rattled together every time she moved."I dunno. I don't really... get it.""Get what?"He was blushing now, face heating up. "Girls."The worst possible thing happened: Lily laughed! She laughed! He stared in horror at her then swallowed, feeling rather betrayed. "I'm sorry!" she wheezed. "I'm sorry! The way you said that just—I'm sorry! I don't get boys either!""You don't?""Christ, no."Remus frowned, tugging at his sleeve. "But you've talked about them... you talk about Prewett being cute all the time.""Yeah?""I don't—about girls. Not... yet." He felt sick confessing this, sick that he had started this conversation. It felt like he was confessing something... dirty. He felt like he might throw up."You do know that boys don't mature as quickly as girls, right? And just cause Black is talking about girls doesn't mean you have to. Everyone's different. Cassie is boy crazy, I mean it's all she yammers on about half the time; that or Quidditch." She rolled her eyes dramatically. "Alice and I definitely don't. Not as much, at any rate. Cassie's pretty much ready for a boyfriend, she wants to kiss someone—proper kiss, I mean, not like the cheek kiss I gave you before—meanwhile Alice says she'd die if anyone tried kissing her. Everyone's different.""I th-think I'd die too," Remus muttered.Lily snorted. "See? I think a kiss wouldn't be so bad. Depending on who. I'd die if it was one of your dumb friends.""Die?" Remus gave her an amused look. "I'd more expect murder."Lily bust up laughing harder than she had earlier. "Yeah, you're right about that!""You don't think it's—it's weird I'm not... interested in girls yet?"Lily bumped her shoulder against his gently. "Of course not. Why would it be weird? You overthink things too much."She's right. He continued tugging at his sleeve as they began walking, feeling sicker and sicker. Her words should have reassured him but he felt like something was wrong about this, he just didn't know what. I'm overthinking it, he told himself, trying to ignore the painful stomachache and the hurting in his chest; I'm just overthinking it./\/\/\/\/\Remus thought a lot that night and into the next day about everything. Girls. His body. What was going on. What was wrong with him. He thought, during breakfast which he barely ate, about that hypothetical book he might be able to find. The one that would involve probably breaking major school rules.Sneaking into Hogsmeade... Remus thought about that as Slughorn began lecturing. Did he really want to sneak into Hogsmeade to get a book? Perhaps he could ask Fawley about it...? If he got a book that helped explain things about his changes then there'd be every likelihood of Fawley seeing it in his head. Maybe she wouldn't, but maybe she would. Therefore he might as well give her the galleons and ask her to get him the book... right? That would... maybe work...Except, with what happened the previous week he worried it'd be Too Much. He didn't want to put more on her, ask more of her. She was doing more than he should ever expect, wha with keeping the secret! But there wasn't anyone else he could ask. Was there?He propped his chin on his hand, thinking. Maybe Pomfrey! She'd probably have something! Except she'd want to know why he couldn't use the library. Could I tell her it'd be too embarrassing for Farrow to know?Pomfrey?Or Fawley?Or what if Pomfrey just started telling him things, just started talking about puberty? He'd die!He sighed, and shifted his chin to his other hand, vaguely aware of Slughorn's drawings on the chalkboard. Both options were embarrassing! The least embarrassing option would be breaking a rule he really didn't want to break: sneaking into Hogsmeade.So now the question is which is worse? Sneaking into Hogsmeade, or asking Madame Pomfrey for a book about puberty and hormones and why I don't have any attractions yet and whether my penis is the right size—He started choking on nothing at that thought, knowing instantly he'd sneak into Hogsmeade. No WAY could he ask ANYONE for a book like that! Not even Pomfrey! Period.Ugh, though it made his stomach hurt at the thought of disobeying such a massive rule. Just remember, you're in Hogsmeade once a month anyway, he told himself though it didn't help.He took some parchment and scribbled a note. When are you planning on sneaking into Hogsmeade? Then he began freaking out, thinking Slughorn might somehow catch them passing such an incriminating note! He quickly folded the parchment up and poked it into the fire. He'd ask after class."Oh, oh no," he whispered when Slughorn dismissed class about fifteen minutes later."What's wrong?" Sirius asked.Remus put everything in his satchel, face burning. "I—I didn't take any notes.""What?!" James began laughing loudly, everyone turning to look at him then going back to what they were doing when they realized it was just James. "You?!""Sh—shut up, I had something on my mind!" He approached Lily in the corridor. "Hey, um, did—did you take a lot of notes?"Lily stared at him while Colgate and Inkwood began giggling. "Yes," she said slowly. "Didn't you?"His face burned even more. "Um. Not very good ones. I'm not, er, feeling great today." He shifted his weight, feeling super awkward about all of this. "It wasn't... well, could I borrow yours?""You can borrow ours!" James called out.Remus rolled his eyes, ignoring him. "Please?""Of course," Lily said, pulling her Potions notebook out of her bag. "You can give it back at lunch.""Thank you so much."The Marauders ran off towards their next class, his friends teasing him mercilessly about his lack of notes. He grumbled, but didn't really mind at all them joking about this. He thought it'd be a good time to bring up what had sucked in all his attention: wanting to sneak into Hogsmeade. Then changed his mind, figuring he'd mention it later on. At lunch or something. Preferably when one or more of them was taking a drink, for the shock factor./\/\/\/\/\James spit his water out all over the table and Peter, Sirius began choking on his food, and Peter didn't even notice James's drink on him, he was too busy staring at Remus as though he just shot a bolt of lightning down to the table."WHAT?" James yelled, voice bellowing across the room."I can't say it now," Remus said, since so many were paying attention to them now due to James's outburst.James began pounding on Sirius's back. "You did say what I thought you said?" He gave Sirius a whallop and a chunk of food shot out. "Ew.""Merlin, not like I meant to choke!" grumbled Sirius, pushing the bit of food under his plate. "Remus's fault.""He said it," Peter whispered. "I heard him.""How about we discuss this after we leave the Great Hall?" Remus suggested.The others finally realized they were essentially on display. "Er, right," James agreed then began shoveling food in his mouth. Remus raised his eyebrows then very slowly began eating, ignoring James's annoyed looks.Once they were all finished eating they left, heading to a private corridor where Remus repeated that he was considering going with them into Hogsmeade next time they went. "I d-d-don't want to go m—many places. Just one. The—the bookstore.""Surprise, surprise," James muttered.Remus shot him a look. "Well. I just want a—a book. A specific book. I don't want... Mr. Farrow to know I've checked it out.""Illegal book?" Sirius asked, perking up."No. Not illegal, if it were illegal I'd be unable to buy it! It's..." He shifted from foot to foot, rubbing his elbow, trying to figure what he should say. "Personal.""Is it about... your... you-know-what?" Peter asked."My what?" Remus asked, confused, slightly panicked because the only thing he could think of was penis, since that's what it was for. Was it so obvious?Peter gave him an exasperated look. "Your—your—""Your furry little problem," James put in and Peter nodded."Oh," he said then was about to say yes then narrowed his eyes at James. "I'm sorry, my what?!""Furry little problem!" James said cheerfully. "Perfect way to describe it, eh?""N—not really!" Remus scowled then decided to drop it. "In any case, yes. It's to do with that."It was a very good, plausible excuse, though it felt EXTREMELY bizarre to be using his lycanthropy as a coverup for something, instead of the other way around! Was this really happening, or was it a bad dream? If someone had told him a month ago he'd be doing that, he'd have thought they were completely off their broom!Then he got to thinking about something else while his friends chattered about Hogsmeade.Maybe... I don't... feel the same sort of attractions because of this. He looked down at his hands. Because of what I am. Was that possible? Maybe—maybe werewolves couldn't feel attraction like that, didn't have romantic or... or sexual feelings. Although, he wasn't so sure about the latter because sometimes he did have weird feelings down there which he generally tried to ignore due to the fact about a year and a half, maybe two years ago his mother caught him... exploring himself and totally flipped out, telling him it was no good, it was wrong, don't do that! He had his doubts now that he was a bit older that it was 'no good', and was probably just his mother freaking out, but it still made him uneasy. He wondered if he had let his father finish his talk about masturbation if Lyall would have said it was okay or not okay?Either way, because he did get those feelings down there... did that mean he was capable of sexual feelings? But girls never triggered anything. No urges. No desire to kiss or hold hands, no desire to stare at their hair or legs, definitely nothing but blank thoughts about their chests and curves. Their bodies were just... zero interest. Nothing. He didn't know exactly what he was supposed to be feeling, but he kinnndaaa suspected it wasn't supposed to be 'nothing'.Because I'm a werewolf? he wondered again, flexing his fingers, thinking about the wolf inside him. Maybe it just saw everyone as prey and that leaked into Remus-the-human? If so, then... well, he wasn't sure what to think if that was the case. Lily said it wasn't strange he didn't feel anything about girls yet but...He knew the book wouldn't help with this problem but maybe it could help with some of the other issues, so he definitely still wanted to get it. Which meant sneaking into Hogsmeade. Ugh.

Author's Note: I forgot to mention on Friday's chapter there'd be a bonus chapter today, sorry! I have the week off so I thought I'd get an extra chapter out today and hopefully (but no promises) an extra chapter out next Sunday too! I'll let you know on Friday for sure if there will be. Thank you everyone for your incredible support!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\James wanted to sneak into Hogsmeade right away, but Remus begged him to at least wait until the weekend. He protested, insisting Remus would just change his mind, and said they could go after Transfiguration, have supper in Hogsmeade, his treat. Remus flat out refused. He said the book he wanted to get he really needed, and would definitely go in, he just didn't want it to be on a school night!"So, Friday night? After classes? That's technically not a school night," James pressed. "And Saturday is the game, and Sunday you'll argue it's a school night.""Sunday afternoon," Remus reasoned."Friday night," James argued."You want to sneak in the night before a game?" Remus grumbled. James shrugged."He's going to be antsy anyway Friday night," Sirius pointed out.Peter nodded. "If we sneak into Hogsmeade then less likely chance of him bouncing off the walls."Remus considered it briefly then sighed. "I have study group Friday night. I doubt we can get back before six so... Sunday afternoon?"Reluctantly his friends agreed, James pouting quite a bit that they'd have to wait nearly an entire week. Personally, Remus felt better having plenty of time to try to... mentally build himself up to be able to actually go. Although putting it off till Sunday did run the risk of the game Saturday causing him anxiety issues. He hoped that wouldn't be the case. But there wasn't any other day to go! The only day he didn't have study group or Occlumency was Thursday, and James had practice that night making it a no-go.Hopefully the game isn't too... awful for me, he thought as they headed to History. Would it be too loud? Too awful, with all the people? If Gryffindor won then the after party would be crazy too, though he could hide out in his room with a pillow over his head. Unless James wants me there. If James really did then Remus would stay at the party for a bit. Not too long.He fretted about it all through History and fretted on their way to Transfiguration, then stopped in his tracks. Everyone was stopped in their tracks, mostly on the stairs. The History classroom was on a higher floor than Transfiguration and they had almost reached the first floor, but there was a bottleneck now due to the fact the first floor was flooded. The water came up a few steps too."What happened?"What's going on?""Why is there water everywhere?"Lily, nearer the front of the group, spun around to face the Marauders. "Potter! Black!""Oi!" James complained immediately. "We didn't do it, we were in History! Maybe you were sleeping too heavily to notice but we didn't sneak out!""I was not sleeping," Lily murmured, though her cheeks went a little pink.Down on the floor a prefect waded through the water, seeing the waiting second years. "Classes on this floor and below are canceled for the afternoon," he said, and James and Sirius exchanged high fives."What happened?" Spinnet asked.The Hufflepuff shrugged. "Accident. Hopefully we'll get it cleared up before supper however you might be eating in your common room.""Is it the entire first floor?" Colgate asked."Yup, more or less.""Did Potter and Black do it?" Lily asked, and James made a very rude gesture at her back.The prefect laughed now. "No, we know who did it. Don't worry about it. It was an accident. I guess you can go up to your dorms and wait for your next class, or... just somewhere up higher than this." He waded off down the corridor, water sloshing at his thighs."Told you!" James snapped when Lily turned again."Don't go blaming us for everything!" Sirius growled.Lily scoffed. "Please. Disasters usually equal you two!""Do you blame us too when your mirror breaks?" James teased.Lily's face went bright red, and she stomped her foot. "You are such a disgusting little toerag, James Potter!""Is that a yes?"She got her wand out and a bright light hit James. He yelped, stumbling back, nearly falling over. Lily tucked her wand away. "Hmph. Come on, girls," she said, nose in the air as she, Colgate, and Inkwood marched off.James straightened up, his nose big, round, and cherry red. "What did she...?" Everyone still there began laughing, including Sirius, Peter, and Remus. "What?!""Now you look like the clown you are!" Spinnet said before he and Struthers went off, laughing still.James stared at his friends and Peter managed to point to his own nose, then doubled over laughing. James's hands flew to his face then he gasped, eyes going wide. "That little rat!" He covered his nose. "And how dare you lot laugh!""Honk, honk!" Sirius said, and James punched his arm pretty hard. Sirius jerked back, rubbing the spot. "It could be worse."Remus, managing to suppress some of the laughter, grabbed James's sleeve. "C'mon, let's see if—" he broke off into snickers then took in a deep breath, "—let's see if Pomfrey can fix that.""Can't you?""I can try..." He got out his wand. "Finite incantatum!" The light hit James's face but the only thing that happened was the bright red faded into more of a brownish red, a slightly redder version of his own skin color. He tried a few more time but James's nose remained as round as a ball. "No. Sorry."James ducked his head, hand covering his lower face. "Let's just get to Pomfrey, then."Sirius and Peter still snickered all the way to the hospital wing while Remus did his best not to laugh. Pomfrey was able to fix the issue easily, and as they left the hospital wing James fumed, threatening revenge against Lily. Sirius and Peter were on board with that while Remus wasn't as. He didn't really like the idea of getting into a revenge circle with Lily, and said so."She had no reason to do that to my nose!" whined James, rubbing his nose. "I think it's still a bit red. I did nothing to her.""You basically called her ugly," Remus pointed out, raising his eyebrows."He's got a point," Peter said.James narrowed his eyes. "Something small. Like. Toads in her bag. Can I do that?"Remus sighed, opting not to answer which the others took to mean yes. The others discussed about getting toads or maybe tadpoles into her satchel, then the conversation switched to whether or not they'd be having supper in their common room or not."Ooh right," Peter breathed out. "Hope the Great Hall isn't too flooded. Think the ground floor is full of water too?""It sounded like it was just on the first floor," replied Remus. "I may be wrong though.""We could use secret passages to get down to the ground floor and see," James said, clapping his hands."Shall we risk it?" Remus asked."Eh, worst thing that happens is we get wet," James answered.So they trooped off, using secret passages and stairwells to get down to the first floor, and those secret corridors were a bit damp but otherwise dry, then they went down to the ground floor. They emerged into the main castle to find the floors were just a little wet until they got to the entrance hall. There was a huge waterfall coming down the main staircase, pouring through the entrance hall and right out the door. There wasn't anyone around so they were able to stay where they were to watch the waterfall for a few minutes then they backtracked and headed back up, going to their common room."Maybe the dungeons are flooded too," said Sirius with a giggle. "Maybe the Slytherins are all underwater." Then he hesitated. "Except Reg.""Of course," the others agreed./\/\/\/\/\Ravenclaw didn't lose any points but apparently a handful of sixth year Ravenclaws were practicing the water-making spell and it went very bad and had taken staff ages to get it fixed as well as dried out (the students did have to eat supper in their common rooms). The dungeons were not, to James and Sirius's dismay, flooded."Maybe we can crack the big windows and change that," James whispered."Why do you want to destroy the Slytherin co—" Remus stopped then dropped his head in his hands. "Never mind.""Answered your own question, did you?" Sirius teased, and Remus nodded.On the way to Herbology Peter asked if they'd be going with Remus that night to Occlumency and Remus hesitated, unsure. He admitted it might be better if it was just him tonight, and he could ask her about bringing them in at a later date. He thought if they all piled into the room it would make Miss Fawley uncomfortable, possibly annoyed. He really wasn't sure what to expect at all. He was quite nervous, and began working himself into sickness. It didn't help he had been having a no-touch-skin-scrapey sort of day already (trying not to wince whenever one of his friends nudged him or smacked his back), and dealing with Miss Fawley touching his head was going to be awful. Really all he wanted to do was crawl under his bed.His stomach hurt worse and worse as the day wore on. Maybe she changed her mind? What if she didn't show up at all? What if she decided it was ridiculous and she just... stopped teaching him?He was beyond relieved when he went in at 6 and found Miss Fawley perched on the purple couch. She wasn't smiling, but she was there."H—hello, Miss Fawley," he said, quietly shutting the door behind him."Is it just you?" she asked, cold.Remus winced. "Yes ma'am.""Hmph."Remus waited by the door then when it was clear she wasn't saying anything else he scurried over, sitting down. "How are you?"She folded her hands in her laps. "I won't lie. Not great. I'm still upset over last week. How is that going?""Oh, it's—it's good. They're... fiercely loyal and extremely kind.""Hmph. Do they pester you with questions?"Remus couldn't help but smile at that. "No. They... they'll make sure I'm g-good to answer anything before they ask anything, and we haven't really talked much about it since... last week." He drew his feet up, wrapping his arms around his legs. "It's still very hard for me. Very, very hard. Sometimes I... I just can't believe it's happened. But. I—I don't want to run. I love it at Hogwarts. And... I care about my friends." Fawley didn't reply so Remus plunged forward. "I... I'm still getting used to them knowing, but it's nice that they do. I mean, I'm not letting my guard down." Fawley raised her eyebrows at that. "I'm not. Just because they know doesn't mean I'm going to get... slack..."He didn't want to admit how much he had gotten slack at times this year, he really needed to be even more careful. If Sirius could figure it out, someone else could. Though he doubted anyone paid as much attention to him as Sirius did.Fawley gave out a long sigh and slumped forward. "I'm sorry, Remus. I'm not being very fair. I told you I'd accept this decision, then I come in here with a harsh attitude.""It's okay. I... understand, Miss Fawley. I know you're just worried about me."Fawley gave him a strange look. "I appreciate that however I do want you to understand that just because someone is worried about you does not give them the right to mistreat you..."He had the feeling she was alluding to something but didn't know what. "Er. Yeah," he agreed, and there was an awkward silence. "I don't want you to be mad.""I'm not mad," she promised. "Only worried. But enough about that. You said you came alone, does that mean they don't wish to learn?"He wrung his hands nervously. "Oh, they—they do. I told them it was just probably best if it was only me tonight, I didn't want to... upset you more. I thought maybe we could give it a little bit of time...? I mean, if you—if you want to... teach them."Suddenly he realized he had no idea why Fawley was teaching him... or rather, if she was being paid for it. Nobody had ever talked about payment. Surely she was being paid for this? Or was it out of the goodness of her heart, and affection for a werewolf? Was Dumbledore paying her? If so, why would Dumbledore pay for his lessons? He wanted to ask but thought that might be a little crass. Except he didn't want to give her a tougher load without paying her..."Um," he said quickly, leaning forward. "If you don't want to that's fine. I could—could talk to—" He realized he shouldn't throw James's money in there without talking to James first. James had said he'd be willing to use his allowance to bribe Fawley but that probably had been a joke. "We can talk about it next week?"Fawley listened to all this in silence then nodded. "How about we just continue with our lessons for today?""Yes, please."It had been a couple weeks since his last lesson and it was a jolt when she touched his temples and he was yanked into a memory. It was Halloween night. Him snapping at the others telling them how stupid it was, them ignoring him, their blood spilling onto the cave floor. He wasn't able to resist her at all, or the second time when he was taken back to his freakout the night the Marauders told him they knew. He saw himself hyperventilating and unable to move, Sirius carrying him to the hospital wing.Once they pulled out, Fawley was frowning. "If you're showing me these on purpose...""I'm n-n-not!" he squeaked, rubbing his aching head. "I promise! I—I'd much rather f-forget that last one anyway." He was so embarrassed to see it, to see himself so—so crazy! How did the others put up with him?! Helping him like that... even knowing the truth... being there for him..."Are you all right?" she asked when he sniffled quietly."Yes." He bent forward, pressing his hands against his eyes. "I don't know.""There are times when our reactions are out of our control.""It's just... shameful." His friends seeing him in such a state, unable to breathe properly, unable to act properly, hardly even able to move...He thought she might try to say it was fine, he didn't need to be ashamed. Instead she said, "It's completely understandable to feel that way... I... I am glad your friends are there for you."He sat back, taking in several deep breaths, then said he was ready to try again. He was unable to fight back at all that evening, and thanked her numerous times when they were done. She told him if he wished to bring the others next time so they could at least 'discuss' the possibility of them learning Occlumency that would be fine. He thanked her again then headed back to his dorm, feeling strange.Overall the lesson had been... normal. Not what he really expected. He knew she was angry about things, yet she apologized for being harsh. But there had been... a bit of a gap between them that hadn't been there since they first started, an uncomfortable, uneasy feeling that separated them. Which was not a good sign. But... she wanted to talk to them again, about teaching them, and that was a good sign (he hoped). So overall he really wasn't very sure what to think.He just didn't want Miss Fawley hating him or feeling bitter about things. He liked her, she was so kind to him, and gave him advice when he needed it. He hated hurting her the way he did... though if he had been told a week ago to choose between losing the Marauders and hurting Miss Fawley... ugh, that was such a sucky choice, but if forced he'd probably go the same way he did: sticking with his friends. He didn't want to lose them, or lose Hogwarts, and he hated that it hurt Miss Fawley but...Remus whimpered a little, clutching his pounding head. Just don't think about it right now, he told himself as he reached the portrait. You can think about it later.He was a little surprised to find the dorm empty before remembering James had practice that night. I should do homework...Instead he went under his bed and closed his eyes, trying to empty himself like he was supposed to for Occlumency. They'll probably have an easier time of it than me, he thought then began laughing, trying to imagine James calming down! He might not be a ball of nerves and anxiety like Remus was, but he was a ball of endless, frenzied energy.Sirius will probably do best. Out of all of them, Sirius was the one who seemed to have the easiest time hiding what he was feeling. Sometimes it was obvious, but more often than not Remus wasn't really sure. He could be acting happy but smell differently, putting a mask on that only Remus could really see behind due to his abilities. Peter might do okay, though he tended to be nervous about things too.Sirius will do the best, then Peter, then James, he decided. Then me. If I ever manage. Leave it to his friends to all master Occlumency ages before he ever did. He hoped Peter would do well! After all, Occlumency didn't really overly depend on memorizing spells or anything. That would help boost Pete's confidence for sure. He needed plenty of confidence boosts.James might be bored though... He could picture that too. A few lessons in and James just deciding nah, too boring, no fun. He knew James would want to do what he could to protect Remus but... he also knew James liked to have fun, and Occlumency wasn't that fun. Sirius liked to have fun too only Remus thought that Sirius would also push through for Remus's sake. For some reason he couldn't figure out, Sirius was just... protective of him.I wish I knew why. Remus rolled over, folding his arms over his pillow, resting his chin on his arms. What had drawn Sirius to him? He had said it was fate, that night they officially became friends. If Sirius hadn't felt compelled to reach out to Remus... what would have happened? Where would he be now? Alone? No, not completely alone, he did become friends with Lily before that. Pinky promised friends.Remus smiled now, tilting his head to look at his pinky. He missed Lily. Even with spending time together on Sunday, and having some time together in study group the night before, he wanted to spend more time with her. Needed to. Should. And Aegis as well. The Marauders were... well, more than friends, but he really didn't want it to just be them all the time.Do they spend time with others? That made Remus pause. James had Quidditch and spent some time with his teammates. Peter had Photography Club and did stuff with them. Sirius... well, occasionally he had some brotherly time with Regulus but other than that, did he spend much time with people outside the Marauders? When he hung out with 'the girls' (Lily, Inkwood, and Colgate) it was with the Marauders. He wasn't part of anything else. No Quidditch, no Photography Club, no Study Group (or a Lily or Aegis).Remus felt a sharp pain in his stomach. It wasn't his place to try to make Sirius make more friends, however it was bizarre to him that probably the most likely to be 'most popular' one in their group didn't... do much outside the group. People disliked the Blacks, but Sirius was charming, and beautiful, and funny. He wouldn't have to do much to make friends. Just flash those pearly whites and crack a joke. If he tried, he'd definitely have tons of friends.He was very grateful Sirius had chosen James, Peter, and Remus as his companions, but it did confuse him a little as to why Sirius didn't have anyone else. Not that he could ask. Or should ask. As curious as he was. Which was very curious.He jumped (knocking into his bed), hearing voices and laughter. He wriggled out from under the bed as the door banged open and his friends in question came tumbling in, giggling over little things. James flung himself at Remus, wrapping his arms around him. Remus, trying not to scream at the sensation of being touched, immediately began complaining at the stench."Practice ran late," James said, pouting when Remus pushed him away, grateful for an excuse to do so. "I can't help I stink." He lifted his arm and sniffed at his armpit. "Ew.""Yes ew," Remus said, not wanting to point out his super sensitive nose made it worse. "Go get your shower."As James got his shower stuff, Sirius asked about how Occlumency went; Remus told them honestly what happened though didn't mention anything about money yet, he decided to bring it up privately with James later. Maybe. He didn't like the idea of discussing money but—but surely Fawley was being paid, and Dumbledore didn't know about the Marauders knowing so he wouldn't be able to pay more, and it wasn't fair to Fawley to take on more students without getting paid more...It was a really confusing situation, and Remus wasn't sure how to deal with it; he just hoped it'd work itself out./\/\/\/\/\As the week proceeded the school whipped themselves into a Quidditch frenzy. Gryffindors kept stopping the Marauders in the halls to give James a pat on the back, a thumbs up, or wishing him good luck. James began swaggering a lot, but when they were alone he admitted how frightened and nervous he was. He began pacing a lot, running his fingers through his hair, staring at nothing... Sometimes during meals he'd cast glances at the Hufflepuff table.Just before Herbology on Thursday, some of the Hufflepuffs began teasing James about the upcoming game."You think you can score past our Keeper?" a boy named Pocklington called out."How old is our Keeper?" asked a girl named Hatch.Pocklington made a big show of thinking. "I do believe he's a seventh year, and has been playing since his third year.""That's a lot of experience!" exclaimed Rivers."Especially against someone who's first coming into the sport, and only twelve," added Pocklington.Remus expected James to explode or say rude things. Instead James put a super sweet smile on his face. "At least if we lose I'll know it's to someone with a lot of experience!" And he swept into the greenhouse, leaving the Hufflepuffs a little bewildered.The Marauders were all bewildered too and when they grouped together to do some repotting and trimming they chose a table way in the back to whisper to one another. Sirius said right off the bat how come James didn't tell the Hufflepuffs he was going to destroy them?James scowled, angrily troweling dirt into a pot. "Ooh, I bloody well wanted to, and almost did but they said that purposely to rile me up. If I got super cocky about it, that's what they wanted. Being nice threw them for a loop." But he shot glares at the Hufflepuffs and flicked some dung at their satchels when he went to get something from Sprout.Remus found out more about the Hufflepuff Quidditch team than he ever expected to know. The experienced Keeper was the Captain, the only new team member was a Beater, and their Seeker only had one year under his belt but so did the Gryffindor Seeker. BUT! Maureen Charmer had beat the Hufflepuff Seeker the previous year, so they had high hopes."All their Chasers have more experience than me," James continued talking as they walked through the corridors to the Great Hall after their post-Herbology showers, "but Bell says I'm better than them, or at least a more natural Chaser than them. The whole team has good feelings about this. And I work really well with Bell and Litten. The only thing I'm really worried about is if something happens to Bell or Litten, cause Kirke—our reserve—really hates me and I don't think we'll work well together.""That's an understatement," Peter said.Every practice Remus had gone to he had witnessed Kirke's dislike of James. The glares, snide comments, eye rolls whenever James talked. It was super irritating and Remus had no idea how Bell allowed it to go on as long as it did. That evening as soon as they got to the pitch Kirke began glaring at James and the other Marauders."Why's he even a reserve?" Pete grumbled as the three boys climbed up onto some of the bleachers."Unfortunately, he's pretty good," Sirius said, tugging at the Gryffindor hat Remus had made him which he seemed to almost always be wearing. "Broom-wise, I mean. Personality wise, he's a total prat and should be thrown into the lake."They sat on the bench together, shivering a little until Remus conjured some blue fire that didn't burn anything else. Sirius kept poking his finger into the flickering flames, then attempted to conjure some of his own and wound up setting the edge of his cloak on fire—real, proper fire. All three of them began shrieking and Sirius nearly tumbled head-over-heels down the bleachers but he got his cloak off and Peter stomped them out."Why do you always set stuff on fire?!" Remus demanded as Sirius inspected the burnt edge."I don't do it on purpose, it just sorta happens," he grumbled, pulling the cloak back on.Peter snorted. "Well, you don't always not do it on purpose."Sirius grinned as he fastened the clasp. "Fine, fine, not always. Sometimes."They sat back down, squashed in close together, leaning forward to get the warmth from the blue flames sitting on the bench in front of them. Sirius went back to poking his finger in. After they watched James flying around a bit, attempting various formations with Bell and Litten, Peter asked if they were still sneaking into Hogsmeade on Sunday. Sirius looked at Remus who froze up, keeping his eyes on the sky."Yup," Sirius said, staring intently at Remus. "Right?""I... I—I..." He fiddled with the end of his sleeve then began tugging at it. "Um." He had been trying to avoid thinking about sneaking in, instead focusing on the upcoming game because every time he thought about Hogsmeade he got a horrible stomachache and wanted to vomit. Even now he wanted to vomit. "Um, we—we can talk about it later.""You're not trying to back out of it, are you?" Sirius asked, narrowing his eyes. Remus shook his head, opting not to answer because he knew his voice would betray him. "All right."Peter wriggled with excitement. "It'll be great. It will, you'll see. You'll love Hogsmeade. The Three Broomsticks, Honeydukes...""N—no!" Remus squeaked in protest. "Bookstore. That's it, for me. You guys can go to other places. I'm just wanting to get—get that book and come back. I—I feel ill enough breaking this rule—""You're breaking the rule already, why not have some fun while you're doing it?" Sirius pointed out. "At least Honeydukes."Remus looked at Peter who nodded vigorously, then over at Sirius who grinned. "Maybe," Remus relented, since he wasn't even sure he'd be going anyway. "Maybe."

Author's note: As I said in an earlier chapter, if I edit a previous chapter and change things I'll let you know. Well I was listening to the podfic and realized I made an oopsie! In Book One Chapter 13 "Jeers and Tears" I wrote "He had a strength to him beyond what a normal eleven-year-old should have though usually he had to focus to use it". When I started the story I was toying with the idea of Remus having to focus to use his strength which I abandoned, but that part got past me. So now the sentence reads, "He had a strength to him beyond what a normal eleven-year-old should have". Sorry for the slip up!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\James was a nervous wreck Friday. He was very distracted through every class and was too antsy outside of class to do much. It was worse than before his tryouts but this time it didn't drive the Marauders as crazy. Last time it had annoyed them more due to the fact everyone knew James would be on the team. This time it was a huge deal.At study group the Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors teased each other a little bit but nothing awful. Bones admitted he sorta hoped Gryffindor won, shocking everyone."I'm kinda sick of everyone in my common room swaggering around saying we're gonna destroy Gryffindor because they've got a twelve year old on the team," Bones said, slapping his hand against the table.Pierce snapped her fingers. "Yes, that's been bugging me too. I mean, of course the bigger and older and more experienced players are gonna have an edge, but if a twelve year old got onto the team it proves he's got great ability. He wasn't the only one trying out, was he?"Remus shook his head. "Th—there were nine. For only two spots, since—since the captain's a Ch-Chaser too. And, well, I g-guess I should say only eight trying out for one spot, since—since Litten was on the team last year and I g-guess it's hard to knock out a previous t-team member.""Eight students, and Mr. Potter got it," Aegis said, shaking his head and giving out a low whistle. "That is very impressive. I hadn't realized that. You can tell him congratulations and good luck for me.""The Hufflepuff in me wants us to smash you into smithereens," Bones said. "The twelve year old in me wants Potter to rub it in their faces.""Could have both," Lily pointed out. "Potter can do super well but Hufflepuff still win. Don't you have to catch the snitch to win?""Not always," Bones said. "Usually the team who catches the snitch does win but it's not a guarantee. But you are right, Potter could get tons of goals but we could still beat you guys. That'd be a good compromise. That's what I'm hoping for now!"/\/\/\/\/\Remus could feel the excitement Saturday morning. He had noticed the atmosphere on game days before but this time it was different because he'd be going to do the game, and he dreaded it. He wanted to watch James, but when the Marauders went to breakfast the buzz in the Great Hall was louder than normal and he knew it was going to be awful at the actual game. He planned on bringing tissues to stuff in his ears and earmuffs. He had tried to learn some sort of muffling spell but nothing seemed to work well, they were all quite advanced."It's cool to see you dressed up," Sirius said as they took their seats. "Finally, a proper Gryffindor."Remus shot a dark look at him. "Being a Gryffindor does not necessarily mean attending Quidditch games."But he was dressed up. James had surprised them all a couple days ago with bright scarlet jumpers. On the front were lion faces, on the back blazed POTTER along with his number, 5. After they finished eating Sirius began putting face paint on Peter and Remus. Remus also put scarlet streaks in his own hair and Peter's hair; Sirius, naturally, refused to have his hair touched but his hair was long enough to pull back which he did, adding scarlet and gold ribbons to the ponytail holder. Some of it was pulled back in a tiny ponytail, the rest underneath was loose. Remus thought the look was exceptionally nice and it made him feel a little strange when he first looked at Sirius after he had done it.Actually he felt very strange.Which he decided to ignore.But his hair did look good."See you guys later," James said while Sirius was still working on Remus's face paint.Sirius gave James a big hug as they all wished him good luck. James grinned and left the Great Hall with the rest of the team. Sirius plopped back down on the bench, returning to drawing on Remus's cheek. His face was bent in close and it made Remus feel even stranger, and a little uncomfortable. Sirius's eyes were locked on Remus's cheek as his finger put the final bit of paint.Shortly after they headed out, Remus taking a moment to put the tissues in his ears and the earmuffs on. It only slightly muted the sounds, and he knew this wasn't going to be good.He was already in pain by the time they got to the bleachers. Kids were shrieking, talking loudly, and cheering. Soon the commentator began talking about the teams, her voice booming throughout the pitch. Remus adjusted the earmuffs, biting his bottom lip. A moment later Lily and her friends came shuffling over, joining the boys. All three wore matching gold jumpers and red plaid pants."This is so exciting!" Lily said as she stood next to him. "This is the first time you're at a game, isn't it?""Uh-huh." More students were pouring into the bleachers, the noise getting louder. Remus adjusted his earmuffs, anxiety rising as they waited for the game to begin. His head was hurting, his ears hurt, and while he wanted James to show off how good he was, at the same time he was hoping the Seeker would just find the snitch right off the bat.Then the commentator was announcing the teams, and the pitch went wild. Remus yelped, his cry of pain disappearing among the screaming, and he ducked down, clutching at the earmuffs, pressing them hard against his head. The Gryffindor section got even louder when their team came out onto the field and Remus was in so much pain he could barely even see James strutting out. He tried to give a shout of support but when he opened his mouth he felt like he might vomit from the pain. He clenched his teeth, forcing the bile back."JAMES POTTER JAMES POTTER JAMES POTTER!" Sirius and Peter screamed, waving their pennants high above their heads, jumping up and down. On Remus's other side Lily was also hopping, clapping, and whistling.Remus was dimly aware of the teams mounting their brooms and shooting into the air. He thought Hufflepuff got the ball first. At least with the game playing the shrieks weren't quite as fevered but it was still painful."THATTABOY JIMMY! YOU GOT THIIIIIIS!" Sirius had his hands cupped around his mouth to make himself louder.The Gryffindors went wild when Bell got the ball from Hufflepuff. Remus pressed his hands harder, head pounding violently. Whatever healing ability he had simply didn't have time to fix the problem, it was a constant ache, constant stabs into his ears and head.. He took in several shaking breaths, trying his best to focus on the game and not the pain but it was hard.He couldn't even cheer when James got the first score of the game.Sirius and Peter's voice pierced into his head and he curled forward, unable to stand it anymore. He forced himself to his feet and pushed past Lily, hurrying through the crowd to the steps. He ran down and dashed to the bathrooms. When the door swung shut it at least somewhat dulled the sounds. He moved his hands from his head and went into one of the stalls, throwing up.How come I can't do this? He stumbled to the sink to clean out his mouth and wash off his face. The sounds still hurt his ears. I have to at least watch. He left the bathroom, wincing as soon as the door opened. He immediately backed up, shutting the door. He stared at the closed door, no idea what to do. His nose began burning as he realized the only way to watch his friend play was to also be in a ton of pain.Well. It can't do any permanent damage, he thought, reasoning it out. Could he withstand the pain for another... however long a Quidditch game took? James knew about his problem so he might understand Remus not being there. However, he'd probably still be hurt. And Remus wanted to be there.He took in a deep breath and returned to the pitch, climbing back up."Where did you go?" Sirius asked as soon as he rejoined them, face full of concern."Loo," Remus replied, putting his hands back to the earmuffs. "Did I miss much?""Hufflepuff scored, that's all."It was horrible. His eyes grew teary though there was a stinging wind so it didn't look too unusual. He barely really noticed much of what was going on in the game, pretty much just watching James and nobody else. He scored multiple times throughout the game, the others scored too, and Hufflepuff scored. At least Remus assumed that was what was going on; it was very difficult to really pay attention. Plus he had to run off to throw up again.It felt like an eternity. Drawn out pain crashing into his head, making him wonder how he could ever do this again. There were some points where the stands were somewhat quiet and he felt a little better but then everyone would begin cheering or booing once more.Then the Seekers were diving, and sound exploded into Remus's head as one of them caught the snitch. He wasn't sure who did because after about one or two seconds of the intense pain everything went black./\/\/\/\/\Remus slowly opened his eyes, staring up at Sirius, Peter, Lily, Colgate, and Inkwood's faces all staring down at him with the sky behind them."He's awake!" Peter said.Remus closed his eyes again, reaching up to cover his ears because the cheering was still loud. "What happened?" he moaned."You fell," Sirius said, pulling Remus up onto one of the seats. "You just went headfirst down some of the bleachers.""What happened?" Lily asked, very concerned.Remus shook his head slowly, figuring he'd just lie. He couldn't tell the truth in front of the girls anyway. "You know how—how clumsy I am. I guess I... tripped and b-banged my head. We won?" he asked, since the Gryffindors were particularly loud."Yes!" Sirius said, pumping his fist. "Charmer got the Snitch."Lily coughed. "I think he should see Madame Pomfrey." She suddenly bent in very close, her fingers gently brushing through his hair as she looked for a wound. "I don't see any marks on your head."Sirius was glaring at Lily, pressing his lips tightly together. "Of course, we'll take him.""No, no, be—be there for James," Remus protested as Lily got him to his feet. "Please. It's n-not fair for none of us to be there.""I can take him," Lily reassured Sirius who still looked angry."I'll catch up to you as soon as—as—as possible," Remus promised. "Give him a high five from me."Sirius pat his back, promising he would, and Peter gave Remus a quick hug. Then Lily linked her arm through his and helped him out of the stands. They took one of the back stairs which weren't as crowded and they were able to get to the grounds quickly. The farther they got from the stands—from the sounds—the better Remus felt."I guess I need to eat a big piece of humble pie, eh?" Lily asked."Huh?"She squeezed his arm. "Potter was amazing. Tell him that and I'll never speak to you again though."He managed a small smile. "I won't," he promised with a weak laugh. "He is very good though.""You looked pretty awful during the game though," she said, glancing over at him. "Like, pale, and frowning a lot, and you clutched your head the entire time.""It was... a little loud," he said, one of the biggest understatements ever."Yeahhh, it was pretty loud."Once in the hospital wing they had to wait for Madame Pomfrey to return from the game who showed up along with some other students. Litten, of the Gryffindor team, showed up with a very nasty bruise on his arm, and there were a couple students with minor issues. Pomfrey eyed Remus but took care of Litten first so he could go celebrate with his teammates in the tower, then she approached Remus."I fell and bumped my head," he said. "You can help the others first." He ignored Lily's furious scowl at that."All right," she said then fixed up the others before returning to Remus. She made a show of examining his head then did some diagnostic spells. "You seem all right, Mr. Lupin. If you bumped your head it doesn't seem like it caused any damage.""Thank you, Madame Pomfrey."By this point all the pain had ebbed out. He had been away from the noises enough that his head and ears returned to normal though he still sorta felt a vague sort of pain in his ears. He didn't want to go to the tower though. He wanted to see James and congratulate him personally, but the party was going to be awful.I can stand it for a few minutes, he decided as they headed through to the castle to the Gryffindor common room. He flinched as soon as the portrait opened. Music was booming and students were talking loudly, cheering, dancing, going nuts. Inside he saw the seven members of the team up on some of the tables. James was with Bell and Charmer, and Charmer had the Snitch in her hand, pumping it around to the tune of the beat."GryffinDOR! GryffinDOR!" several students were chanting.Others were chanting for Charmer: "CHARMED! CHARMED! CHARMED!"Sirius and Peter were both chanting James's name, of course.Remus and Lily parted as he squeezed through the crowd to the team. "James!" he shouted and James jumped down, hugging Remus, picking him up and spinning him in a circle while he tried not to let the pain show on his face from the loudness. He hoped he looked cheerful enough."WE WON!" he shrieked happily. "WE WON!""Congratulations!" Remus laughed, hugging back. "I knew you could do it!""Come on!" James took Remus's hand, pulling him towards Sirius and Peter."No, I'm not—I'm not staying," he said and James's face fell. "It's loud," he said, pointing at his ears and James's mouth formed an O. "I'm sorry. I—we—we can celebrate later?""Okay," James said and they hugged again. "See ya later! Enjoy your quiet, lil buddy!" He ran back to the table, climbing back up to join his teammates.Remus told Sirius and Peter the same, then left the common room, heading towards the library. It was so quiet in there and Remus just went under one of the tables, curling up, enjoying the quiet. He could hear sounds. Farrow doing things at his desk, a few other students in the room walking or turning pages, but overall it was so nice and the pain in his head slowly began easing up.What am I going to do? he wondered, staring at the bottom of the table. There were marks in it, names carved by previous students. How in Merlin's name was he going to be able to support James at future games? This was way worse than trying to deal with the smells of Potions.After a long time he crawled out from under the table and went in search of some muffling/quieting spells he might be able to use. They were all fairly advanced so he picked the easiest one and began studying./\/\/\/\/\The Gryffindors partied well past supper time, most of them opting to bring food to the common room. Remus marveled at their ability to not stop. It had been hours but they were still going nuts. They continued celebrating past curfew and Remus was forced to go to his dorm room, hearing the sounds below. With the door and his curtains shut it wasn't too terrible..."Reemmmyyy!"The others came in, pushing through the curtains and piling onto his bed, James still in his sweaty Quidditch uniform.Remus folded his legs, smiling. "You don't need to be in here.""Nah, I want to be with my friends," James said, elbowing Remus. "The party's fun and all but this is better."Sirius pulled out a bottle of butterbeer. "Stole this from a sixth year," he said, seeing the surprised looks on their faces. "Where's the cups?"Soon there were four full glasses they clinked together, Sirius, Peter, and Remus congratulating James yet again, saying how proud they were, and how amazing he had played. Sirius and Peter made comments about some of the moves James pulled and Peter jumped up, gesturing wildly to show off what one of James's scores looked like from the stands."You were all WHOA! And that Hufflepuff Chaser was like WAAAH! And you just... WHOOOOOSH! RIGHT past the Keeper!"Sirius laughed, spilling butterbeer all over Remus's blanket. "You should be a Quidditch commentator."Peter flopped back down, scowling. "Like you could do better."Sirius thought about this for a second then shook his head. "Whoa, waaah, and whoosh are very fitting!""What did you think?" James asked Remus.He sipped thoughtfully at his drink, trying to buy time. "I think I had no bloody clue what was going on," he finally replied causing his friends to all laugh. "I've read that book but—I'm sorry, I really had no clue! And these two, who promised to tell me, just shrieked your name over and over."Sirius made a face while Peter looked a little sheepish. "I guess I got too caught up," Pete said. "I'm sorry.""No, it's fine, I'd rather you lot enjoy the game than have to spend time explaining everything," Remus told him. "Besides..." He took another sip, looking down at the amber liquid. "It was—I wasn't—I—"James looked very worried at Remus's stuttering. "You didn't enjoy it?""No! No, I—I did! I just... it was... very loud. It was... pretty difficult to give the game my full attention." He flushed at this confession, hoping they didn't press him much; he wanted them to know a little of what happened but not the full extent."You were hurting?" Sirius asked, frowning."Errr, a bit," he replied and Sirius looked upset."I didn't realize...""No, it's fine," he lied. "I'm fine."Sirius and James were both studying him but at least Peter accepted his word. "It was a brilliant start to a brilliant season!" he said, clapping his hands. "Next up... ummm... is it Ravenclaw or Slytherin?"James blinked a few times then grinned. "Ravenclaw. Then Slytherin." He took a long swig of his drink then jerked his arm, the butterbeer sloshing out. "I can't WAIT to smash Slytherin! It's going to be SO good!" He rambled on about the Slytherin team, and about how he couldn't wait to see their game against Ravenclaw next month to see the team in action since they had a few new team members.Then Remus asked how many scores did James get exactly? What was the final score?"Two hundred seventy to ninety," James said, beaming. "I got four of our goals."Remus squinted, trying to remember the scoring. "The Snitch gets you a hundred fifty right? So that's... 12 goals total?""Uh-huh! And I got four of them! Bell got five, and Litten got three.""Bell only got two of them cause of you," Peter pointed out."That's right," Sirius said, elbowing James. "You could have gotten those goals—""Nahhh, I couldn't, Dartwind was on my tail," James protested, shaking his head. "The only way to get that fourth goal was to give the ball to Bell, and I got hit with the Bludger almost as soon as I threw it to her. If I had been aiming at the goal, the Bludger would have hit me and I would have lost the Quaffle.""Were you hurt?" Remus asked, furious at himself for never noticing James had gotten injured!James got onto his knees, yanking up his shirt to show a bruise across his abdomen. "Not bad, eh?""James!" Remus snarled. "Go to the hospital wing!""Nah.""Litten did!""I'm not Litten," he said haughtily. "This is my first Quidditch game and I want the bruise there.""You're barmy."Sirius held up his hand. "Actually, that's me, according to—YAAAH!" he yelped as Remus grabbed his pillow and walloped him with it, sending the rest of his glass spilling onto the blanket."It does look cool," Pete said, leaning in close to study the bruise."Mum and Dad are so proud," James said, pushing his shirt down."Of your bruise?" Remus inquired with a sweet smile.James snorted, giving him a gentle push. "Oh, stuff it. Dad is beyond happy and Mum just cried and cried..." Remus knew the Potters had gone to the game, and he did wish he could have at least properly met them. "You know, cousin Bore-My-Ass tried to get on the team when he came to school and never got on.""Was he a Gryffindor, or a Slytherin?" Sirius suddenly asked. "Blacks are all Slytherins, but Potters are usually Gryffindors."James giggled. "Neither, he was a Ravenclaw.""You know, I don't get the whole 'this family is in that house' and 'that family is in this house'," Peter said, crinkling his nose up. "The Hat—" He stopped suddenly, going pink. "Well, the Hat didn't even consider my mother's house which was Ravenclaw. Course, I'm not that bright or clever...""I agree," Remus said. "Oh! Not the last bit!" he added quickly when Sirius and James dissolved into giggles; he felt absolutely horrified realizing why! "No! Peter, I wasn't—I meant—I meant the first bit! You are bright!"Peter was laughing too. "I know what you meant!"He sighed with relief. "You are," he added for good measure. "I meant... how Sirius is what, the first Black not to be in Slytherin?" He looked at Sirius who nodded. "And you've talked before about how your blood predisposes people towards you. It's quite confusing.""Not for the Sorting," Sirius said with a shrug. "It makes great sense that families usually end up in the same house.""Not... really," Remus said.Sirius grinned. "The Hat takes a lot of your ideals into consideration, right?""R... right...""And usually you get your morals, your opinions, your thoughts on life from your family," he pointed out and Remus was dumbstruck. It made... so much sense. It was completely logical, and he was surprised he hadn't considered that before. "For the Blacks tradition, lineage, ambition, Pureblood ideals are the most important!" he said in a gruff, deep voice, slamming his fist into his hand with each word. "We grew up with this ground into our head. I mean, yeah, the Hat takes blood into some consideration but really...""Yup!" James had rolled off of Remus's bed to fetch some snacks from his trunk. "Raised as a Potter I was taught that bravery and chivalry is sooooo important. Stand your ground, stand up for yourself, don't take any shit."Peter crossed his legs, tilting his head in thought. "I was just taught by my mother that magic is important, I don't think she really pushed anything about smarts or bravery or ambition or loyalty. What about you?" he asked Remus. "Smarts?"Remus bit his bottom lip. Sure his parents had always encouraged his learning, his inhalation of books, his burning desire to learn but... "No. I'd say secrecy.""Secre...?" Sirius trailed off, realizing what he meant. "Oh.""Oh," Peter agreed a little awkwardly.Remus bowed his head, partially regretting saying it. Even though they knew... then it trickled into his mind, wrapping around his brain, that they knew, they knew and were acting so normal with him, and it overwhelmed him yet again. He grew quite dizzy and sipped at the last of his butterbeer to give himself something to focus on.James tossed several different bags of crisps and sweets onto Remus's bed. "That's the last of my stash; I'm gonna have to get more tomorrow. But yeah, Siri's right—""Don't call me that," Sirius interjected.James ignored him, "—it just makes sense that most of a family ends up in one house.""You grow up with a Gryffindor in charge of you, you get that way of thinking into you," Sirius said, catching the last bag of sweets, a bag of gummy cauldrons. "You grow up in a Slytherin house, that's what you believe."Remus slowly shook his head. "I cannot believe I never thought of it that way. I am exceedingly impressed, Sirius."Sirius struck a pose. "I'm not just a pretty face, you know.""You're not even that, mate," James joked. Sirius made a swipe at James who ducked, laughing."Speaking of tomorrow—" Sirius began."We weren't," Remus muttered, knowing what was coming."—Hogsmeade! And we were, James mentioned needing to buy more snacks, so there." Sirius stuck his tongue out and Remus tossed a crisp at him which missed him by half a foot at least. "You suck.""You suck.""Great comeback, Lupin, an E at the least."Remus stuck his tongue out right back at him then yelped as a white and yellow Every Flavor Bean hit him directly on the face. The others began talking about Hogsmeade, when to leave, where to go, when to come back... Remus started to remind them he was only going to the bookstore then he shut his mouth, debating even going at all yet again. Is getting a book like that worth it? he wondered, putting the bean in his mouth with slight trepidation. Bananas and cream!"You are coming still, right?" Peter asked. "You keep making faces."Remus swallowed. "Uh, y—yeah, of course," he got out, choking a little on the bean. All three of them looked suspicious. "I—I am. Yeah, I am.""You swear?" James demanded."Uh-huh. Yeah, of—of course."Ugh, now he definitely couldn't get out of it!

Author's Note: Two things. One, regarding the extra chapter Sunday I am still hoping to get it out but I've been feeling under the weather. If I'm feeling really sick Sunday I probably won't. Hopefully I can, but I'll be good and not push myself. Two, I guess warning for underage tipsiness in this chapter via butterbeer? Probably obvious from the chapter title but hey./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus tossed and turned Saturday night, and felt guilty and anxious, and had nightmares about screaming crowds and his ears bleeding. When he woke up at eight he decided there wasn't much point in trying to get back to sleep. Instead he took a very long, hot shower in attempt to calm himself down but all he could think of was how bad it was to sneak in, how many rules he constantly broke, and how he shouldn't do this. Dumbledore risked so much for him and he just threw it in his face! He was a horrible, ungrateful little brat.Remus had too much anxiety to even eat breakfast when they all went to the Great Hall. He poked at his porridge, drank half a glass of orange juice, and then went to the nearest bathroom to throw up."You look like you're going to your own funeral," Peter said when they got ready to leave."I feel I am," he muttered in response, clutching at his stomach."Merlin's sake, it's just a quick trip to Hogsmeade!" James said."It'll be fine," Sirius promised.Remus glowered a bit at that. "Famous last words.""Look," James said, pulling his jacket on, "you're the one who wanted to go, for whatever book you're interested in. If you don't want to go then don't go."Remus looked down, head pounding. I really... want some answers... "I'm going," he said.Sirius grinned and tousled his hair. "Perfect. Let's go!"They went to the fourth floor, down a side corridor where James and Sirius stopped in front of a giant, ornate mirror that stretched from floor to ceiling. "Watch this," James said and he breathed on the glass then wrote 'open' in the fog. The mirror slid open. "Pretty darn cool, huh?"They went in and the mirror snapped shut. Remus turned. It was a one way mirror, you could see out into the hall. Then he turned to look at the passage behind it. "This is enormous!" he gasped out, looking around. It wasn't just a passage, it opened up into what looked like a room, bigger than some of their classrooms!"You could hold a party in here," Pete agreed."You could," James agreed reluctantly, "if you want people to know about it. Which we don't. C'mon, lads!"James and Sirius lit up their wands and led the way. The passage grew smaller until it was about the size of a normal hallway at Hogwarts, then grew even smaller until pretty much there was only enough space for them to go single file. If Sirius reached up his fingers could brush the ceiling.The passageway wound downwards, the stone soon turning to rock and even dirt in some places. Remus tripped over a pile of dirt then looked up to see a bit of a hole in the 'ceiling' which was... just dirt. "Is this safe?" he asked."Probably," came James's reply.Probably. Remus looked at Peter who seemed pretty white-faced. "Is this how you got there before?" he asked.Pete nodded. "Yeah but it's still a little frightening. What if it caves in?""Oh puh-lease!" Sirius laughed. "It's not gonna cave in."At least there was more room through this passage than the one under the Whomping Willow. Remus kept his eyes on Peter's back, trying to figure out if this was quicker or shorter than going to his house in Hogsmeade. It felt longer. A lot longer. But eventually the passageway began rising up and then came to a dead end."We're here!" James said excitedly."Where's here?" Remus asked, looking around. James pointed and Remus looked up to see there was what looked like a tunnel going up into the ceiling, though it was dark. Covered. "That?"Sirius jumped, fingers catching on a rope ladder that unfurled. "That," he said and began climbing up. He reached the top and pushed open the trapdoor or whatever it was, letting bright light in. Peter went second, then James made Remus go third."In case you try to run off," he teased.Remus rolled his eyes but grabbed hold of the rope, pulling himself up. It swayed as he climbed then there was Sirius's hand, hauling him up through the entrance which turned out to be a stump in the woods. In the forest. James crawled up through the stump and Sirius swung the top down. It looked like a regular stump, no indication that there was a passage underneath.Remus wrapped his arms around himself, shivering a little as they trooped through the trees. He felt violently ill at being so far from the school, for doing something so wrong. He knew using excuses like oh it's only for a little tiny trip and I come here all the time during the full moons were just excuses and not true reasons. No matter how you looked at it, he was breaking one of the biggest rules.Course, is it any worse than when I set Snape on fire?After a couple of minutes they all stopped at the top of a little rise, looking down into the village of Hogsmeade.Remus had never really seen Hogsmeade before except brief glimpses from the train station, and a little bit at a distance when he came back from the previous Christmas holidays. Due to the full moon he hadn't been able to come back on the train and had to use a portkey to some fields nearby where Hagrid picked him up. Now he was looking at the sweet, quaint little village blazed in late autumnal glory.James headed down the hill with Sirius following, then Peter, and finally Remus. The stomachache had faded at the sight of the town even though he still felt some anxiety. James began singing an old song about Hogsmeade and the others joined in. The beat fit perfectly for walking.They trooped into town, their voices fading as they didn't want to draw too much notice however Remus figured it was pretty obvious to anyone they were Hogwarts students. James led the way to high street, where most the stores were. Remus looked around as they went, excited for when they could legally come into Hogsmeade and he could properly explore. Hogsmeade had such a fascinating history, and had so many locations of interest.The store windows were full of bits and baubles, all the shops ready for the Christmas shopping season. A couple stores already had some Christmas decorations up along with signs advertising perfect gifts. The other Marauders kept glancing at various stores with excitement, whispering about where they'd go next, but first the bookstore.Tomes and Scrolls was a fair bit way down the road, and it was quite large. Remus's eyes went huge as he stared at the giant display of books in the window.Sirius laughed, slapping Remus's back. "You're starting to drool.""It's so... beautiful!" Remus said, wishing he had more than two galleons, wishing he could spend all day there!"Let's go!" Peter said, heading towards the door."No!" Remus grabbed him, pulling him back. "Um. I mean, I—I was hoping to—to shop alone." They all gave him curious looks and he ducked his head, tugging at the hem of his jumper. "I just... um, it's just that... I was hoping for a little... privacy.""Blimey, what sort of book are you getting?" James joked, and Remus tried not to blush."We know about... the stuff," said Sirius with a shrug.Remus gulped, glancing at the store then back at his friends. "Please? It's really... personal and... I know you know but..." He shifted from foot to food, tugging more at his jumper.They agreed, on the condition he at least went to Honeydukes which he reluctantly agreed to before going into the bookstore. His eyes got even bigger as he took in all the shelves. He hadn't been in many bookshops before and most had been small except for Flourish and Blotts in Diagon Alley. This one seemed to be on par with F&B, and this time he was free to look around, he didn't have his father dragging him around to buy the one book they had needed at the time.Except, I don't have all the time, he reminded himself, walking down one of the aisles. His fingers ran across the spines and he felt excitement bubbling up inside—no, not like bubbles. Like fire.Oh! He froze, staring at one title. A history of various runic languages specifically within Wales. He immediately pulled the paperback out, flipping it open. He knew a little about the history of Welsh runes, and this specific tome had been referenced in some other books he had read. He looked at the price. It was just under a galleon. If he could find a book about puberty and—and that stuff for just under a galleon he could get both books.He clutched the runic book to his chest. If the other book cost more than a galleon... it was the book he intended to buy... but...He shook his head then headed straight for the Health aisle. Most the books here were medical books and spells. It took him what felt like ages but he finally found a book called Your Body At Hogwarts, which explained everything a kid needed to know about their body, its growth, changes, etc, etc that they might go through between the ages of eleven and eighteen. He closed his eyes, sending a quiet prayer of gratitude, then looked at the price.Well over a galleon.His heart dropped and he started to turn away to put the runic book back when he spotted a paperback version of Your Body at Hogwarts. He quickly pulled it out.Nearly a galleon. He could probably get both!Remus ran to the front, arranging the books so the runic one would be on top as he nervously set them on the counter. The clerk tapped the top book with his wand then slid it aside to tap the second. His eyebrows raised and Remus went red. "Starting Hogwarts next year, are you?" he asked kindly as he slid both books into a paper bag, assuming Remus hadn't even started.Remus squeaked out something that might have been yes then waited for the total. One galleon, fourteen sickles, twenty-six knuts. Remus handed the two galleons over. The clerk popped open the register and counted out three knuts and two sickles. He reached out.Remus had no idea what to do. He began panicking, and the clerk stared at him. "Take your change, laddie," he said, thrusting his hand out closer to Remus's face."Uh. Ahhhh. C—could—could you p-p-p-put the—the ch—change in the—in the bag?" he whispered, terrified.The clerk frowned and suddenly Remus regretted everything. He knew the clerk would figure it out! How stupid was he?! He should have let his friends come with him, see the dumb book he got, and then one of them could take the change! Him not wanting to touch it was so obvious! The clerk would probably summon the Ministry and—"Suit yourself." The clerk dumped the money in the bag and pushed it across the counter. "Have a good day."Remus left the store, trying not to run. James, Peter, and Sirius were lounging on a nearby bench, hopping up when Remus came out. They wanted to know why he looked so flushed."The clerk thought I was ten," he grumbled darkly. His so-called friends immediately burst into laughter. "Gee, thanks.""What did he say?!" Peter demanded."He asked if I was starting Hogwarts next year," Remus said, and they just laughed some more. "Shut up, you're all horrible.""Poor Remy," Sirius said, messing up his hair again.Remus ducked away, scowling. "One of you want to take the change? I can't really use it anyway.""Huh? Why not?"Remus sighed, smoothing down his thick hair. "There are sickles. It's down in the bag." He opened the bag, offering it to James. "Don't look!" he yelped, jerking the bag back when James started to peer in. "Just take the money out."'Why? It's yours," James said."I can't touch it," he said very softly."Why not?" Pete asked."Sickles," he said but they remained confused. "There are sickles." They still didn't get it! "Silver," he hissed out."Oh MERLIN!" Sirius exclaimed, smacking his own forehead."Blimey!" Peter wheezed out."Aw, bloody hell, Brains, I'm sorry," James said and stuck his hand in the bag, feeling around for the coins. "I'll use it to buy whatever sweets you want at Honeydukes, all right?""All right," Remus said, totally embarrassed. "I'm just glad the—the clerk didn't think too much of me wanting the ch-change in the bag." He closed the bag, holding it close to his body. He had never really dealt much with money before. His parents never left sickles lying around the house, but sometimes his dormmates did. He was able to ignore it, pretty much, except the occasional shudder. The closest he had ever come was in his first year when Sirius tried to hand him some sickles due to Remus winning a bet. Remus had managed to refuse, stating he didn't want the money and wanted chocolate instead.He knew, at that point, I was a werewolf... or, suspected really, Remus realized, glancing at Sirius as they headed to Honeydukes.His friends had described Honeydukes to him multiple times but it still didn't prepare him for walking into basically Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. All three of them grinned at Remus's sharp intake of breath."Isn't it perfection?" Peter asked."Merlin's beard," Remus whispered.Shelves of sweets everywhere, hundreds and hundreds of sweets everywhere, barrels of sweets, walls of sweets, tables chock full of sweets. Sweets of all kinds. Gummies and chocolates and fruity and sour and spicy and savory. In the middle of the room was a table with a chocolate Quidditch pitch. A full pitch with green grass and wooden-looking hoops, and stands and bleachers, all decked to support the English national team. Floating lazily around the pitch were seven figures made of chocolate, flying around on chocolate brooms, playing with four little chocolate balls including the tiniest little Snitch."Miiine!" James picked up a box with a miniature chocolate Quaffle which was a bit smaller than an actual Bludger. He also grabbed a chocolate Snitch which was the same size as a regular Snitch. Then he grabbed a Bludger as well. "Hold on, gonna go get a basket."The basket was soon full, all their sweets mixed together, and James had to get another basket. He encouraged his friends to get whatever they wanted, and sometimes when he put something in he'd say it was for Peter, or Remus, or Sirius. Remus argued but James ignored him. Remus somehow resisted the urge to take up James's offer of getting more, and only got himself a single fudge chocoballs which pretty much took up all his money. He could probably get 'more' chocolate if he got a couple bars... but fudge chocoballs were without a doubt the best."Here," James said when Remus put the little cellophane wrapped treat in the basket. He took the wrapped chocoball out and grabbed a box holding a dozen fudge chocoballs."What? No, I can't aff—""SORRY CAN'T HEAR YOU!" James yelled and ran off.Remus started to shout at him then realized they were in a store and he shouldn't be yelling. He grabbed the wrapped single one and chased James down, and they struggled, spilling several boxes of sweets out."Remus come on, I want to!" James snapped, plucking the single one out. "Please! I want to!""No, I—you can't!""I can so, and I want to. Let me buy you stuff!""I don't want you to!""Well, I want to!""Hey!" They both jumped when the clerk shouted. "Stop fighting or I'll summon Dumbledore, I know damn well you've snuck out of Hogwarts."Both boys fell silent then looked at each other. James grinned, pat the box of dozen chocoballs, and waltzed off. Remus glared at him then reluctantly put the single one back. He wouldn't get anything else, at least he could put the two sickles towards the big box. Stupid James.Finally James put the two big baskets on the counter, not even phased when the total came out to quite a few galleons. James handed them over, thanked the employee, then led the way out of Honeydukes with the bags swishing at his sides, wanting to know where they were headed to next."Back to Hogwarts," Remus said then paused. He did sort of want to see his house. Really want to see what the outside looked like. He knew he would in a year but... that was so far away... "Maybe a tour.""A tour?" Sirius spun around, eyebrows arching. "You've seen most of high street."Remus didn't want to outright say what he wanted to see. "Show me around a little bit. Just a little."So they went along the rest of high street, looking at all the shops, James whining when they went past the sporting shop and couldn't go in, and they went past some other places... and then they were headed past the houses and there was a little hill with a house at the top. His friends began explaining that was the haunted house but Remus would have known it anyway.It looked like it had been there since Hogsmeade was founded, practically; it was narrow (though he knew that from being inside) and very ramshackle and run down. The windows and door were all boarded up tight. There was a dying tree in the yard, and a fence around the hill. It looked utterly and horrifically haunted.That's my house, he thought, staring up the hill. A shiver went down his spine. His fur caught in splinters inside, his pawprints, his blood splashed on the walls..."We never did come back at night to hear the screams," James remarked."We need to do that," Sirius said cheerfully.Remus went towards the gate, studying the large no trespassing sign. He couldn't help but wonder what it might sound like. The spells Dumbledore put on the house, the screams. The howls. Then he shook his head. What am I thinking?! Sneaking out at NIGHT?"No," he said, turning back to his friends. "It's an awful idea.""It'd be fun!" James said and Sirius nodded in agreement. At least Peter appeared to be a little unsure.Remus glanced back at his house then folded his arms. "I won't. This is bad enough, doing it at night—""You've snuck in once, you're telling me you won't again?" Sirius asked."Absolutely not," he said, finding it ironic that in eight days he'd be sneaking into the house they were standing in front of. A week, already, he thought, feeling completely strange that it had already been a couple weeks since the Marauders confronted him! It still did not feel real. "I'm not staying, either. I'm going back to Hogwarts."Sirius snorted. "You're really trying to convince yourself sneaking in for a short amount of time is somehow better than a longer time? At least come to the Three Broomsticks for a hot butterbeer. You've never had it like that. It's good. You'll like it.""Oh, you'll love it," said Peter excitedly. "Come on, just one butterbeer."Remus started to protest but James said, "If you even try to say you don't have the money, don't even try. I'll pay, it's not that much anyway.""Come on, come on," Pete whispered temptingly, tugging at Remus's sleeve. "What's another half hour?"Remus groaned. "Oh, fine."The Three Broomsticks was really a part-inn-part-pub, and it was very cozy. There were several adults sprinkled around at the tables, and a couple of non-humans. Remus bit down on the inside of his cheek hard when he saw what was undoubtedly a pair of hags, and then a group of goblins. They were both classified as beings as he was a beast, but it was a little amazing for him to see non-humans in a public place. Even if the hags were eyeing the Marauders as soon as they came in, and Remus suddenly wasn't sure if twelve year olds were 'children' enough for hags or not, though he doubted these were the kind that feasted on children's flesh since they were in public; that was usually reserved for the... wilder ones. Or... was he being unfair? He hated the stereotypes placed on werewolves, and here he was doing the same. Although there was actual evidence of hags enjoying human flesh but..."You two again?" called out the barmaid who was probably only in her early twenties. "Should I be sending a note to the headmaster?""Madame Rosmerta!" Sirius said, jogging over to the bar. "You're looking as lovely as ever! I swear you get prettier every time we sneak in!""Keep that silver tongue of yours in your mouth," she laughed, glancing over to the others. "Oh, you've got a fourth with you!""Yeah, this is our friend, Remus," Sirius said in a boasting way.Madame Rosmerta looked at Remus with a sweet smile. "Nice to meet you, dear." Remus mumbled a greeting back then followed James and Peter to one of the tables but he could still hear the bar, and heard Madame Rosmerta say quite clearly—in a manner that was only meant for Sirius—"Such a mischievous lot you are, dragging a first year out here!"Remus's face went brilliantly red and he sank down in his seat, clutching his bag to his chest. First the bookstore clerk, now this. Did he really...? He was small but he didn't think he looked young! Small did not equate young! Peter—Peter was only slightly taller! Course he had more meat and muscles on him and he looked healthy, and Remus was sure his frailty was another reason he possibly looked young but still. He couldn't wait till he looked his age."I wonder why none of the shop owners tell the headmaster you've come here, since it's so obvious," mused Remus as he watched Sirius flirting with Rosmerta."Money of course," James snickered. "I mean, I'm guessing that's why. I'm sure they're used to kids sneaking here. I doubt they'd hide us if the teachers came looking, but otherwise we spend plenty of money—""You spend plenty of money," Peter cut him off.James beamed. "Yeah. Well, anyway, that's probably why. Ahh! Here we go!" Sirius returned with a large tray with four tanks of butterbeer and a giant plate of chips. "You'd make a good waiter," James teased.Sirius pretended to nearly drop the tray on James who yelped, jerking back, falling out of his seat. Then Sirius laughed so hard he actually did almost drop the tray and Peter and Remus each grabbed a side to keep it still. Finally everyone was back in their seats and the drinks were handed out. Remus curled his fingers around the handle of his tankard, looking down into the foam."To the Marauders!" Sirius said, lifting his tankard. "Beauty, Brawns, Blithe, and Brains!"The others echoed his toast and clinked their glasses together. Remus took a sip of his, not sure what he was expecting, but it was very good and somehow tasted completely different from cold butterbeer. He wound up with a lot of foam on his nose which caused a lot of giggles with his friends and they wound up flicking foam at one another."Try these!" James urged, pushing the plate of chips over.Remus took one and nibbled at the end. "Ohhh Merlin! These are amazing!"They went through them very quickly and James went to get more, along with fried fish, stuffed mushrooms, small meat pies, and four more butterbeers, then four more. The boys devoured every last bite except for Remus who still felt apprehensive so he only nibbled a but here and there, though by the time he downed the last of his third butterbeer he felt rather giggly. He knew that too much butterbeer could cause a bit of tipsiness—there was a very vague alcoholic content in it but not enough to do much unless you had a lot, so he wasn't sure why he felt this way."Your face is so red!" laughed Sirius."Is it?" Remus pressed a cool hand against his cheek. "I think I've had too much.""Ohhh I'm gonna burst," Pete moaned, rubbing his stomach.That struck Remus as very funny and he dropped his head into his hands, giggling more."Remy, are you okay?" James inquired."Yes! I'm fine, just—just really happy," he promised, not moving his hands. He hadn't had any more butterbeer than his friends and they clearly weren't affected. Probably cause I'm not human, he thought and instead of feeling bad it just made him giggle more, quite loudly. It all seemed so funny."Bloody hell," Sirius said, shaking his head as Remus slid down in his seat."We're gonna have to carry you back!" James said, smacking the table"I'm fine," he repeated which wasn't as convincing as he hoped since he said it with a snort and more giggles."I think you're drunk," Pete said.Remus shook his head. "No! I can't be, I—I've read the bottles, there's not enough alcoholic content to make—anyway, none of you are and I've had the same as you!" Then suddenly he remembered something he had read before. "Ohhh maybe it's because I'm small.""You're on about your size again?" James asked.Remus glared at him and then spoke, finding it a bit difficult to get the words out between the giggling. "No. Well. Y—yes. Sorta. I mean, I guess maybe it's... having a little more... of an effect on me than you three due to my—er, size. Plus—I barely ate anything and you three had a lot."They took this information in and then Sirius leaned in, smirking. "So, you're drunk.""NO! I'm—I'm not—just—just...""Happy," Peter supplied with a grin."Yes," Remus agreed then dissolved into more giggles. He couldn't imagine what his parents would say if they saw him! Well, not the whole... sneaking-out-of-Hogwarts-breaking-the-rules thing or the having-friends-when-he-shouldn't thing, but the... the okay-maybe-a-bit-tipsy thing."I did not know you could get drunk on butterbeer," James said in an awed voice."I'm not drunk!"James ignored him, jumping to his feet. "'Scuze me." He hurried to the bar but soon returned with a scowl. "Damn. Rosmerta won't sell us any more.""How come?" Sirius asked.James gestured at Remus. "She's noticed he's drunk—""Not! Drunk!""Happy," Peter reiterated.James rolled his eyes. "Fine, she's noticed he's happy and says we can't have anymore.""Well, my apologies for ruining your plans on attempting to get drunk on a very minute amount of alcohol which would probably kill you from overindulging on liquids before you had enough alcohol to even make you drunk," Remus complained.There was a beat of silence then James flapped his hand. "Okay, you're not drunk, no drunk person could say all that."Remus tried to give him an annoyed look but was too giggly for it and just folded his arms on the table and put his head down on them to continue his laughing as quietly as he could. He couldn't stop. The others put the leftover food in some takeout containers, Sirius tried begging Madame Rosmerta to sell some bottles of butterbeer to no avail.They left the inn and Remus was stumbling maybe a little bit, and Sirius put an arm around his waist to help keep him upright. "I'm fine," he grumbled, but Sirius wouldn't let go. His arm was pretty warm and Remus didn't really mind so much. More giggles came."I'll take Brains back," Sirius offered."Aren't we all going back?" Remus asked."I still need to go to the grocer's to get snacks," James said, handing the heavy Honeydukes bags to Sirius. "Pete, you coming with me or going with them?""I'll stay with you, to help carry stuff if you need," Peter said.They bid farewells and Sirius helped Remus through town and into the woods, back to the stump. Sirius took hold of one of the roots, pulling at it three times in rapid succession. The 'lid' swung open. "I'll go first, in case you fall," Sirius said and shimmied down through the hole."I'm fine!" Remus growled down at him then slid into the hole, clinging to the rope ladder. It took a little effort to reach the bottom, not that he'd ever admit it. Sirius tugged the rope ladder in the same three quick pulls and it rolled itself up while the stump closed. "Lumos." Remus's wand lit up the passage as they began walking, since he only had one bag while Sirius had two."Did you have fun?" Sirius asked.Remus tried not to giggle more but couldn't help it. "Yes, all right? I did, I had fun. Are you going to be smug now?""Oh, insufferably smug," Sirius laughed. "Did you get the book you wanted, by the way?"Remus hugged the bag close. "Yes, I did, and another book about Welsh runes.""Sounds nerdy. I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. I mean, it's obvious you enjoyed the Three Broomsticks, everyone could see that."Remus stopped in his tracks, glaring back at Sirius. At least was his intention. He stumbled when he turned and his arms wheeled. He dropped his bag of books and would have fallen if Sirius hadn't grabbed him, yanking him back upright, knocking into him."Okay, I don't care what Jimmy thinks, you're drunk.""I am NOT drunk!" Remus wriggled away and picked up the books. He was horrified that they had partially slid out but the runic one was on top, blocking the view of the body one. He pushed them back in and straightened up. "You know how clumsy I am.""Being clumsy makes you giggle?"Remus whipped around, standing at full height, glaring up at Sirius. "Look—"But Sirius was laughing so hard he nearly dropped the bags. "I'm teasing, I couldn't help it! I know you're not drunk." He gave Remus's head a pat. "Happy."Remus eyed him suspiciously then turned back around and began walking again for a bit before being unable to hold back, and began giggling once more at everything that happened while Sirius looked exceedingly amused.

After returning to Hogwarts, Remus and Sirius went straight to their dorm, Remus putting his books in his trunk while Sirius put the sweets in James's trunk and the leftovers in his own desk. Remus wanted to study his new book alone but Sirius wanted to hang out so they wound up playing chess down in the common room. By this point he had managed to calm down and wasn't giggling at every little thing which disappointed Sirius.James and Peter returned much later with loads of snacks to squirrel away, then Remus spent most the rest of the afternoon with them, had supper with Lily, then hid away in his bed with the curtains shut. He had Your Body At Hogwarts in front of him and felt a little nervous opening it up, as if someone would pop through the curtains and see it, and laugh at him, even though nobody was around.He began reading about exactly what to expect. Growing pains, getting taller, muscles aching, voice changing... other parts changing... He went a little red (and felt a strange shiver through his body) when he flipped the page and saw drawings of various sized male genitals. He glanced around again then pulled the book up closer to him, hiding it from nobody. He was a little relieved to find out there wasn't any normal size, that boys of his age were expected to have a variety of sizes and there wasn't any... exact size changes, everyone changed at different rates. He might reach adult size within a year, it might take him until after graduation. Plus judging by the pictures he wasn't unusual or anything. Everything seemed to be... going correctly.He closed the book, feeling quite relieved. He wasn't really sure what he had expected. He chalked it up to anxiety more than any real concern, but at least now he knew.He crept into the bathroom and waited a moment, listening carefully. Then he took his shirts off to study his upper body, checking under his arms for any signs of hair, then flexing his scrawny arms, trying to ignore his ugly scar. He pulled his shirt on, listening again just in case, then pushed his pants down to examine himself from the waist down.Satisfied well enough, he returned to his bed, pulling the book onto his lap and flipping it back to where he had been, though he didn't read on. He just wondered if the others were worried about their own bodies like him. Sirius seemed to be a little, considering his confession on his birthday, but was that all? Did James worry? Did Peter? Remus bit his lip, wondering if he was overthinking everything again, worrying about stuff he shouldn't worry about. Was he being stupid?He flipped to the index, trying to find something that might help him know one way or another if worrying like this was normal but then he heard voices in the hall: Struthers and Spinnet. He shut the book and jammed it under his pillow though he remained behind his curtains when they came in. He just felt uncomfortable looking at stuff like that with others around. He got the book he had been reading the evening before—The Dead Dragon—and settled in till the Marauders came back.Remus didn't sleep well that night, tossing and turning until he finally woke up feeling really hot and flustered. He tugged at his pajama top and fanned himself, squirming miserably in bed. They hadn't been nightmares, he knew that, but try as he might he could not remember the dreams. He kicked off his blanket and just slept under his sheet, clinging to Gwyllgi, wishing he knew a cooling spell./\/\/\/\/\Tuesday morning was super foggy and the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs made their way to the greenhouses with their arms outstretched and their feet feeling carefully for bumps and rocks. When they went into Greenhouse Two a bunch of fog rolled in with them and Sprout had to do a spell to disperse it."Oh, so that's what we look like," joked James, and there were several titters.Professor Sprout smiled and then rested her hand on the large tray full of mushrooms in front of her. Identical trays were laid out across all the tables. "Anyone know what these are?" Several hands raised and she called on a Hufflepuff who replied they were jumping mushrooms. "Precisely," she said and then pulled one of them out of the dirt. Immediately it began wriggling and then got out of her hand, jumping to the ground where it began leaping around the greenhouse."Now, the best way to deal with them is the immobilizing, which you've only just started learning last week, I believe," Sprout said, clapping her hands together. "Since that is an important spell when interacting with a variety of plants I wanted you to practice on flora. I suggest using it on the mushroom before you pull them out to transplant them.""Good thing we have Brains," Sirius muttered."Who says I'm doing all the work?" Remus replied coolly. Then he smiled when Sprout told them to partner up in pairs. "I'll be with Pete.""Yay!" Peter said."How come?" James grumbled."Cause Pete was the only one nice about—what happened Sunday," Remus said, stepping closer to Peter. "You two were teasing me all day yesterday.""Yeah, cause it was funny," James snickered and Sirius smacked him. "Ooh, fine, sorry for teasing you."Remus pulled a tray in front of him and Pete and began immobilizing the mushrooms. Pete pulled the first one out a little nervously but it was frozen. He happily pushed it down into a tray of deeper dirt. They began working through the mushrooms, both of them laughing as the mushrooms began bouncing wildly whenever Sirius and James yanked their mushrooms out. They had to go chasing around the greenhouse though they weren't the only ones. Pretty much everyone was running around. Lily was good with the spell so she and her partner, a Hufflepuff, did well, then another pair of Hufflepuffs were doing great, and Struthers and Magpie were doing decent. Remus and Peter were the only ones who didn't have to do any chasing, until Sprout told them they both had to do the spells.Peter's face fell. "Bloody beans," he hissed out then jabbed one of the mushrooms. "Immolibus!""Immobulus," Remus corrected but Pete had pulled the mushroom out. It sprang out of his fingers, smacking Remus in the face, then bouncing off."I'll g-get it," Pete sighed and went chasing. Remus eyed Peter's side of the tray and then froze up some of the mushrooms. "Okay," Pete said, coming back with the mushroom tight in his hand. He pushed it into the deep dirt then turned back to the main tray. "Imm...""Immobulus," Remus said again and showed him the wand movement."Immobulus," Peter said and then cautiously pulled out a mushroom. "I DID IT!" he shrieked and several students laughed. He flushed a little then put the mushroom in. "Immobulus. Remy!" He brandished the second frozen mushroom. "Look!'""You're doing great," Remus said with a smile, hoping his plan worked.Pete went through the other four mushrooms Remus had frozen then did the spell on a mushroom Remus hadn't. Remus held his breath as Pete pulled it out. It wiggled... slightly. Sluggish. Pete seemed happy enough and pushed it into the deep dirt while Remus resisted the urge to did a fist pump. Some of Peter's mushrooms were wild but several were very sluggish, and the last one he did was frozen.That's all he needs, is the confidence, Rems thought as he transplanted his last mushroom, wishing he could tell Pete but of course he couldn't. "You did amazing," he said."I can't believe I managed it...""You just need to trust your own abilities," Remus said.Peter beamed at him. "I don't know how I'd do anything without you guys," he said, and Remus was a little worried Pete had worked it out. But then he said, "You guys believe in me when I don't. It's... well, I dunno. It's... really nice of you."Remus elbowed him and Pete elbowed back, both of them grinning. "You did better than Sirius," Remus pointed out, though he had the feeling Sirius hadn't even tried, he had looked like he was having too much fun chasing mushrooms.As they left class Peter bragged about the seven mushrooms he had frozen, skipping ahead with Sirius cheerfully while James tugged at Remus so they were going a bit slower. "How many of those did you freeze for him?""What?" Remus tried to look super offended. "What—what do you take me for, doing something so deceitful?"James smirked and bent in super close. "A Marauder."Remus scowled then cast a glance ahead at Peter. "Don't tell him.""Hah! I knew it. Sneaking behind a teacher's back.""No! No, not for that. I—I was just trying to boost his confidence, okay? And it worked. He slowed down quite a few and froze one himself."James wrapped an arm around Remus, yanking him close, messing up his hair in a similar way that Sirius always did but it felt sorta different for some reason. "I won't say a word. But wait till we get to the dorms cause I have a terrific idea.""Oh great."After their showers they sat around on James's bed since Struthers and Spinnet had gone off to do whatever it was they did, and they were able talk freely. James's terrific idea was getting their hands on hundred ("Hundreds!") of jumping mushrooms and putting them in Snape's dorm. Remus wasn't really pleased at the idea since it meant Aegis would be affected too, and Peter suggested they just put the mushrooms in Snape's trunk."Imagine him opening his trunk and WHOOSH!" Peter flung his arms up. "A fountain of jumping mushrooms!""It will still affect Aegis though!" Remus said."Not like the mushrooms will do anything except annoy them," James pointed out, twirling his wand between his fingers. "They'll be able to take care of them." His wand slipped and twirled across the room. "Oops.""What if..." Sirius trailed off, squinting his eyes in thought. "What if we don't do it to Snivellus though."James whirled around. "What?!" he demanded, sounding betrayed. "Not prank Snape?!""Don't get me wrong, pranking that git is still number one on my list!" Sirius reassured him, holding up his hands in defense. "But I was thinking maybe we could... prank a different dorm.""An older Slytherin?" James asked, scrambling back to his bed.Sirius slowly grinned. "I was thinking we should spread the love. We haven't snuck into the Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff dorms yet."James's eyes got huge. "Aww yeah!" He high fived Sirius. "Yes! Let's do it! Which one?"The three of them began weighing out the pros and cons of which dorm to prank while that troublemaking itch began going inside of Remus. His heart beat a little faster and he felt quite thrilled at the thought. Then he couldn't stay silent anymore and said, "Ravenclaw.""What?""Ravenclaw, let's prank Ravenclaw," he repeated. "Specifically Craft.""Craft? Raven Craft?" James asked and Remus nodded. "Isn't he in your study group?""Yeah, and he's a prat," he replied with a shrug. He thought of all the snide remarks, the sneers... Twycross was the worst, but Remus didn't like Craft. "Please?""Yeah, that's fine," Sirius said happily."Yeah, I'm up for pranking whoever," James agreed. "Just as long as we prank someone.""Are we stealing the mushrooms?" Peter asked, and Remus looked at James and Sirius a little worried they'd be stealing from the greenhouses once more.James shook his head. "Nah, I don't think the mushes are very expensive, we can buy a bunch next time we sneak into Hogsmeade.""Like that won't be suspicious," Remus muttered but nobody paid him any attention."We're sneaking in again soon?" Peter asked."Soonish," James said with a shrug then he turned to Remus. "You should come in with us again, and get drunk." Remus kicked at him, and James laughed. "Whoops! I mean happy.""Has Craft bothered you?" Sirius inquired, swinging the conversation back.Remus shrugged. "Not... overtly. As I said, he's a prat." Really, the worst thing Craft had done so far this year was the way he had treated Macdonald. She had not deserved the way Craft and Twycross treated her; it had been two months but it still left a bitter taste in his mouth. He pictured Craft opening his trunk and the fountain of jumping mushrooms popping out. It was great./\/\/\/\/\Remus had Occlumency that night, and he thought he'd be going alone but Sirius told him he'd like to go too. Remus didn't think Fawley would be pleased, but Sirius said again he really wanted to see her again, to talk to her."I won't stay," he said as they headed to the fourth floor. Remus mumbled under his breath about putting it off, and Sirius sighed in response. "I have to face her sometime, if we're going to learn.""Just don't be surprised if she throws you out," Remus said."I'll be absolutely shocked if she does," he teased back.Remus tapped at the door then went in, holding up a finger to indicate for Sirius to wait. Miss Fawley was on the couch already, as always. They greeted each other and she could tell right away from his voice something was up. He wondered if his emotions were so easily read by others, or if it was just because Fawley had to rely on hearing more that she was able to tell. He hoped it was just the latter..."Mr. Black?" she asked with an irritated frown when he explained what was going on."He wants to talk. A little." Remus tugged at his sleeve, glancing back at the door. "If—if you want me to send him away, I will."Fawley thought about it then agreed to have a chat. He could sense how upset she was and felt guilty when he opened the door. Sirius bounded into the room, a big smile on his face although Remus could sense how anxious he was. It was a big change from the previous time. The first time they had met, Sirius was out to protect Remus; this time it was to show Fawley he'd be a good student."Hello," Sirius said, sounding as cheerful as he could. "Is it okay to call you Miss Fawley?""That's my name, so I'd prefer it over anything else," she replied icily, smoothing down her skirt.Sirius began laughing. "Of course." He sat down without any hesitation and Fawley stiffened, sliding a little more into her corner. Remus watched this with trepidation. "I'm not gonna stay long cause I know how important this lesson is for Remy, but I thought I should... um, talk to you again. About... if... we can learn.""I haven't made up my mind yet," she replied, sounding similar to how the Marauders sounded when they had to talk to Snape.Sirius's head bobbed up and down. "That's understandable. But I wanted to plead our case. Remus—he's more than our friend. I want to do anything and everything I can to keep him safe. I don't care how long it takes me to learn Occlumency, and I don't care if it's painful. I'd die to protect him!"Fawley snorted. "I said last time, I'd really appreciate it if you save your theatrics and melodrama. It won't work on me."Sirius looked at Remus who just looked down. "I'm not trying to be dramatic... it just comes naturally to me." He grinned at that and Remus covered his face, although he noticed out of the corner of his eye that Fawley's lips tugged into a brief, split-second smile. "Seriously though..." Then he stopped, pressing his lips tightly together."You're trying not to make a joke about your own name," Fawley said.Sirius slowly nodded. "Yeah," he replied in a strained voice as he tried not to laugh."I've seen enough of Remus's memories to know that's your favorite pun.""It's just so good."Fawley shifted a bit then seemed to Remus as if she were actually... relaxing a little more? She was obviously still uncomfortable, but Sirius's charm was... working on her? Remus thought he might have a heart attack."Seriously, though," Sirius said again, "I want to do what I can for Remus. We all do. I know we're just—I know Jimmy and Pete are just twelve and I'm already thirteen—""Oh, what a difference," Fawley said flatly.Sirius ignored her. "—but I told you before, we all said, we care about him. We know how dangerous it is for werewolves... we know what will happen. And we really want to do whatever we can for him. I know if you do choose to teach us it won't be for a while, but we are all on board for this. Big time. And I don't know how much you're being paid to teach Remus, but James said he'll pay for us."Remus was startled by this, since they mirrored his own thoughts from the previous week about Fawley and payment. He hadn't realized the others discussed it!"It might be quite expensive," she said. "I imagine his allowance as the Potter heir is decently sized but what if it means giving up all those snacks and sweets you like to buy? The treats he gets? The pranks?"Sirius opened his mouth then shut it, obviously thinking through what he'd say. Another heart attack for Remus. "I can't answer for James. It's his money, not mine, though he was eager to pay for this. And I don't... get very much, but what I do get is yours."Fawley twisted her cane around in her hands, face utterly impassive, no way for Remus to tell what she could possibly be thinking. "You don't care for your family, do you?"Sirius jerked back, quickly glancing at Remus who shrugged. He had no idea why she said it either. "No ma'am," Sirius replied, a little tightly. "Some are—some I don't mind. And I care about my brother. Why?""It just surprises me that a Black is willing to go so far to protect a werewolf. Toujours Pur, isn't that your motto?"Remus's stomach twisted. Fawley had mentioned the Black family motto before although never told Remus what it was, and he had never asked Sirius or looked into it. Always pure, he thought, recalling Fawley's words the first time she brought it up: it didn't just mean Muggleborns and half-and-halfs.Sirius laughed. "No, definitely not. My motto is... one for all, all for one, and four to the end. Same as the other Marauders." Remus snorted and covered his mouth, trying not to laugh. "But it is the House of Black's motto. I just... personally don't agree with it. Remus is half-and-half, and a werewolf, and he's as important to be as James with his 'pure' line. Peter too. I'd go far to protect any of them. But especially Remus.""Why especially him?" Fawley asked, and Remus wanted to know the answer too!Sirius coughed, avoiding Remus's gaze. "He's the one who needs it the most," he mumbled awkwardly. Remus looked down at his shoes, feeling really flustered for some reason.Fawley tightened her grip on her cane. "Then why did you tell James and Peter the secret?"Sirius went pure white at that. "Ah. Well, I—I mean—that's... It's not..." Fawley raised her eyebrows, waiting. "Maybe I shouldn't have, but... we're... we're all friends. And I thought... it was something we should know... together.""You had this secret of his, and you told two people."Sirius's face now went rather red. "All right, fine, yeah, I screwed up. I shouldn't have told them! But we're the Marauders. And I knew they wouldn't care any less about Remus, and I thought if we all knew and told Remus together it would be better for him, that he could see we're all together for him! I mean, I had no idea he'd react the way he did and I feel bad for doing it the way I did, but now he's got three more people on his side who care about him, and accept him, and isn't that good?"Fawley did smile now. "Yes. It is good, in a sense. I just want to make sure you understand that you did make a mistake."His face went even redder and he muttered something not even Remus could make out."It doesn't bother me that he told them," Remus blurted out, wanting to come to Sirius's defense. "I'm glad he told them. It's been very difficult for me to... to accept that they know, and—and accept that they accept me. But the—having all three of them together, knowing, is a lot better than if it was just Sirius. And if he hadn't told them and he told me he knew, then keeping that from them both would be awful too, and made me so sick with dread thinking I needed or—or should tell them." He doubted he was making much sense, since he couldn't even really understand why it was so much easier that they all knew before coming to him; only that it was.Fawley nodded. "What's done is done, we can't change that. I am glad it turned out well, but as I said, I wanted to be sure Mr. Black understood what he did. I am curious to know if I can please see when you told them. I'd like to see those."Sirius frowned, running his fingers through his hair. "Ahhh. Ah. Yeah, uh, okay. I—I need to... remember that moment, right?" Fawley nodded then put her fingers up against his temples and Sirius closed his eyes. "Okay..."Remus was really interested to see what it looked like from the outside, however it wasn't anything like it went for him: pretty much immediately she recoiled, pulling her hands away from him as if he had burned them, and she gave a yelp of pain. Sirius jerked back, eyes snapping wide open."What happened?" Remus asked, head swiveling between the two.Fawley had a curious expression on her face. "Let me try again." She reached out, fingers brushing against his face as she found him again. Pretty much the same thing happened minus the pained sound. "Oh.""What's going on?" Sirius asked, rubbing his head.Fawley held her hands out, palms upward, flexing her fingers. "It seems you don't need Occlumency lessons.""Wh—no! I need to!" Sirius protested. "Did you see something that changed your mind? What—what was it?"Fawley shook her head. "You're a natural Occlumens. I saw nothing."Remus's jaw dropped and he stared at Sirius in shock; Sirius looked equally shocked. Neither of them spoke for several seconds until Sirius whispered, "Natural...?""Do you have the ability in your family?"His mouth open and shut a few times and then he hesitantly spoke. "Uh—well, my uncle can do Legilimency with a spell, and my—well, I think one of my cousins is pretty good at both, and another cousin is a natural Occlumens. I... I'm one...?""Yes. I couldn't get through at all," she said. "You're quite strong.""That... that is awesome!" Sirius cried out, looking at Remus, amazed. "I—wow!"Remus smiled back at him, giving a thumbs up and congratulating him. He was happy for Sirius, it was wonderful and definitely cool... but a tiny little part of him couldn't help but feel jealous. A year of struggling, and trying, and working; a year of pain and misery and anxiety over whether he'd ever be able to get it, and the most he could do was put just a wimpy little paper towel barrier up. Sirius didn't even have to try, he didn't even know he had it! It wasn't fair. Remus especially hated he felt it was unfair because it wasn't... well, fair to feel it was unfair. Sirius couldn't help it.Still...Sirius was puffed up a little. "I never knew. I knew some family had it, but I never knew I could. So nobody can get through?""I'm not sure. I doubt it, however there are much more powerful Legilimens than I," Fawley explained. "Someone like Albus, for instance, may be able to. But you should be able to at least put up a good fight.""Professor Dumbledore," Sirius whispered. "Merlin's beard."They talked a little more, then Sirius left so Remus could have his shortened lesson. Remus was pretty distracted by everything that happened that he was unable to even do the paper towel barrier... though, as he said goodbye and left, he was relieved Fawley hadn't seen the puberty book or the butterbeer incident; he had forgotten entirely to talk to her about them beforehand and now he wouldn't need to for two weeks, since next Tuesday evening he'd be a wolf.A natural Occlumens, he thought, and swallowed, trying to ignore the bitter jealousy threatening to rage up inside of him.

Author's Note: Referenced and Internalized homophobia in this chapter; after the snogging bit and ends when Remus goes to bed/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Sirius was incredibly psyched about the discovery of his ability. He told James and Peter when they came back from James's practice, and only stopped talking when Struthers and Spinnet came in. He wriggled around and was obviously wanting to talk more and indeed he and James disappeared behind James's curtains and Remus could hear them whispering about it. Sirius wished he could find out more about his ability, was considering checking out a book, etc, etc. Remus tried to do his homework but grew more and more bitter until he slipped out of the dorm and went to get a shower.He hated himself for feeling this way! Especially with another Marauder! But no matter how hard he tried he couldn't get rid of the sickening jealousy within him. He scrubbed away at his skin so roughly that it grew quite pink. He dried off, threw his pajamas on, and stalked back into his room. Sirius was still talking about it.Remus dropped into his bed and shut the curtains. He was happy for him, he really was! He just wished he had some of the ability. Just a little.He sighed and hugged Gwyllgi to his chest, trying to go to sleep. Even though Sirius and James were being very quiet he could still hear them, and nobody else was going to sleep so the dorm was a bit too loud. He flopped around then gave up trying to sleep, instead getting his book out to read, considering getting Your Body at Hogwarts but not daring with others in the room. He hadn't looked at it since Sunday night. He hoped to have a bit of private time to read more soon.../\/\/\/\/\Over the next couple days Remus struggled with the jealous feelings. Sirius bragged anytime they were all alone and actually checked out a book on Occlumency to read, which caused James to stagger around and collapse dramatically on the floor, clutching his chest. Sirius kept asking Remus all sorts of questions, and Remus helped him the best he could with a smile.Part of him was worried he felt this way because normally he was the best at whatever he did? But when others did better than him in other things it didn't bother him. Like Potions, he wasn't jealous of James and Peter being really good. Or in Defense when someone got the upper hand in a duel, he thought it was great. So he didn't think that was why he was jealous...But he supposed it didn't matter why he was jealous, just that he was jealous and hated feeling this way about a friend. Which got him to wondering if they ever felt jealous of Remus. It was a laughable thought, to be jealous of someone cursed so darkly, but he was very good at school. Did they ever feel jealous about that? How almost everything learning-wise came so easy to him? That he was able to glide through new spells, and even tinker with words to the point of forcing new spells into existence?It made him ill to think they might be, but considering his own misery over jealousy he figured... he hoped if they were jealous they felt as bad about it as he did.Of course, there were things about all three of them to be jealous over. Sirius over his dazzling looks, James over his amazing Quidditch ability, and Peter having such an incredible eye with the camera. But he wasn't jealous over Sirius's looks, or James's Quidditch talent, or Peter's photographer's eye. Just Sirius being a natural Occlumens.On Thursday when Peter innocently asked if Sirius had told his brother, Sirius grew nervous. He said he hadn't, and didn't really want Regulus to know. Didn't want anyone to know, especially his family. That piqued Remus's curiosity since one of Sirius's cousins was an Occlumens; but when he asked, Sirius went a little white and changed the conversation entirely. Remus and Peter both felt bad for causing distress but when they tried to apologize Sirius just laughed and said they hadn't done anything wrong, even though it was very obvious they had.That night after Astronomy Remus heard Sirius and James talking behind James's curtains. Remus still hadn't really told them how much he could hear, and knew he needed to soon. He tried to cover his ears but could still hear them. Sirius wasn't going into many details but he told James how afraid he was of his family knowing, and something about not wanting to be used. Remus buried his head under his pillow and pressed the ends against his ears, muffling them even more but not enough, then gave up and just left the room. They went quiet when he got out of bed and he went to the bathroom, staying there for quite a few minutes, and when he returned they had finished their conversation./\/\/\/\/\Friday morning Remus was feeling a bit better. The jealousy had simmered down. Sure, Sirius didn't need to do a thing to protect his mind but Remus would eventually be able to protect himself. He just had to try harder. Work harder.During Potions Slughorn started going over some stuff they had learned earlier in the year and Remus practiced emptying himself, tuning out of the lecture. He calmed himself... thought about a book... a blank book... he was a blank book... you opened the cover and there was nothing there... hundreds of pages of creamy white blankness...Remus jerked as something hit the back of his head. He reached up, feeling something wet and sticky. Twisting around, he glared at Mulciber and Avery who were directly behind him. He tried to tug whatever it was out of his hair but it wouldn't budge. His fingers wouldn't either. They were stuck.He swore quietly and pulled, figuring if he ripped his own hair out the barber-witch that came in could regrow it, and any pain would diminish quickly. But then he accidentally yelped in pain when he gave a mighty tug, and Slughorn fell silent."Something wrong, Mr. Lupin?""Th—there's s-something stuck in my hair," he replied, flushing as the class began snickering.Slughorn came over, bending in close. Remus tried to hold his breath since Slughorn's clothes smelled particularly strong of various ingredients today. "Sticking solution," he said. "How did you manage that?""I—I didn't!" Remus squeaked as more laughter spread. The Marauders, Lily, Colgate, and Magpie were the only ones not giggling. "Someone th-threw it at me!"Slughorn made a tsking sound, looking at the desks behind Remus. Of course everyone protested their innocence, and none of them had seen anything. "Go wait in my office. I have some potion that will dissolve it. I'll be with you in a moment," Slughorn said, pointing towards his office door.Remus got up and stormed to Slughorn's office, going in and throwing himself into a seat. A moment later James joined him. "What are you doing?" Remus asked, assuming James had tried to sneak in.James turned around and pointed at where some sticking solution had been stuck to his hair. "I never felt it hit me, I didn't know until Slughorn saw it," he sighed, sitting down. "Sirius and Peter are fine. They probably woulda gotten some if you hadn't noticed yours. Gits." He flung himself into the seat next to Remus, folding his arms. "They've hardly done anything lately, we should have known something was up.""They haven't done anything to us," Remus pointed out. "They've probably been terrorizing the first years.""So much revenge, so little time," James joked and Remus snorted.Slughorn came in after a couple minutes, making it clear he assumed James and Remus had done this to themselves. His theory was that they were messing with the sticking solution for some sort of prank and got it in their own hair.James glared. "You can look in our bags, we don't have any of the sticking solution! Maybe you should check Mulciber and Avery's bags while you're at it.""Now, now," Slughorn said, getting a flask of potion out. He drizzled some out into Remus's hair and Remus was able to get his hand away. Slughorn then drizzled some into James's hair, then instructed them to just go rinse their hair out. They were dismissed from the rest of class.James was very grouchy as they headed towards a nearby bathroom, complaining bitterly about Slughorn's inept assumption the boys had done it to themselves. "As if we were that stupid!" he growled as he shoved his head into a sink."We... were," Remus pointed out, going to another sink and running warm water. He ducked his head in and began rinsing the potions out of his hair. "Remember? When we dropped the cauldron full of sticking solution?"James scoffed. "That was an accident, you didn't purposely get covered."Remus refrained from pointing out Slughorn assumed this was an accident as well, and just used a drying spell on both of them to try to make their hair less wet; he didn't completely dry their hair since it would severely damage it, but at least they weren't soaking wet. Then they went to wait for Potions to end. Aegis was one of the first ones out and he approached Remus, ignoring James's glares, asking if Remus was all right and what happened? Remus told him and Aegis frowned."They are such bullies," he said, stepping to the side as Sirius and Peter appeared."Us?" Sirius demanded angrily, only hearing the bullies thing."Misters Mulciber and Avery," Aegis replied, unphased by Sirius's irritation.Sirius immediately relaxed. "Oh, yeah, yeah, they're complete bullies. You're so lucky you don't have to share with them, though I don't imagine sharing with Snivellus is much better."Aegis tilted his head. "How do you know who I share a dorm with?"Sirius blinked then smiled. "Remus mentioned it. Once.""I see." But Aegis was studying Sirius curiously. Remus hoped he wouldn't work out that the Marauders had access to the dorms! "I'm very glad you are all right," he said, turning back to Remus.Sirius half-stepped in front of Remus. He was uneasy at Sirius standing like that, as if he needed protecting from Aegis! "It was just sticking solution, why wouldn't he be?"Aegis frowned, hugging his potions book tighter. "I was unsure whether or not they added anything to the sticking solution, that's all."Slowly Sirius and Peter looked at Remus and James. "Uhhhh, as far as I can tell there wasn't anything added," James said, reaching up to touch his hair. "Bloody brilliant to do though! Thanks for the idea, Silverlocke.""Yeah, thanks Silverlocke!" Sirius echoed, grinning.Aegis looked faintly horrified he had sparked a Marauder prank. He stared at Remus who smiled and shrugged. "Ah. Er, right," Aegis said slowly. "I—I'll see you tonight, Remus.""I think we scared him," snickered Sirius as Aegis scurried off."But really, how brilliant to add something to a sticking solution!" James whispered, clapping his hands. "Not just... you know, what we did with the eggs and Snape's bag, but something else. Oh... OH! REMUS!" He whirled around and grabbed Remus's shoulders, but a few students were looking at them so James couldn't say anything else. He began pushing, shoving Remus down the corridor with Sirius and Peter following until they ended up in a secret corridor. "We need to research if there is anything in the solution that dissolves the sticking solution that—that reacts with something else.""What do you mean?" Remus asked nervously."Like, adding something in, so when Slughorn puts the other potion on something happens!" James said, eyes shining. "Like, fizzing up or something.""Fizzing... like the whizzing worms?" Peter asked."OH!" Sirius shouted."OHHHH!" James echoed and then smacked Peter on the back. "Yes, that is perfect!""I think the sticking solution may... activate the whizzing worms," Remus said slowly. "We could test it though. Perhaps I could figure out a spell to prevent them from whizzing up until something else is poured on."James hugged Remus tightly. "You're a genius, an absolute genius!"Remus just sighed, mentally adding this to his list of things he needed to research for the Marauders, then realized he hadn't gotten a pranking notebook the last time they went into Hogsmeade. Perhaps he'd ask James for a cheap one when they went in for the mushrooms.../\/\/\/\/\That night James, Sirius, and Peter wanted to do some exploring. Well, James and Sirius did, Pete just agreed with a little apprehension. Remus agreed to stay on lookout. It was Friday night so Remus wasn't alone in the common room until well past one in the morning. He sat in a corner, unable to really check the entrance but figuring the others wouldn't be coming back till even later. Finally, though, he was alone and he curled up in an armchair by the entrance while he read, going to the door every ten to fifteen minutes. That is, until he heard footsteps on one of the staircases at around two-thirty. He quickly hid under the chair as someone came down the girls side, then someone came down the boys side. He could see their slippered feet rushing to one another, then heard kissing sounds.Oh no, he thought miserably, covering his ears as the sounds grew louder and quite frantic. There were moans too, and they kept saying each others names over and over, muffled as they kissed. Ohhh no! He pressed his hands against his ears harder, trying desperately to block the sounds. Why tonight? Why me?!Then James's watch beeped. Remus quickly turned it off, terrified he'd be caught. He doubted either would be very pleased to find someone had been 'spying' on them!"Did you hear something?" the girl asked."Naw, probably just a painting. Come on then, my sweet, come a little closer..."Remus mentally let out a sigh of relief as they began snogging again, putting his hands back over his ears. Their feet disappeared as they fell back on one of the couches and he prayed they wouldn't do anything worse than kissing! In the common room? Surely not! It was a—a public area! All right so no one was around as far as they knew, but still. Kissing was one thing. Doing more was another.Though he did wonder what 'more' entailed. He had a few foggy notions from books he read but they never really described anything exactly. One of the historical fictions... or supposedly historical fictions he had read once began to go into a little bit of details but he abandoned the book before it got any worse, not interested in the time about sexy romance. Actually, it didn't seem very interesting to him now. Kissing a girl. Putting your hands all over their body. He couldn't begin to imagine what that would be like! The other Marauders were very interested in boobs but Remus still really didn't see the attraction."Oh—oh Terrence!" the girl moaned out.Remus silently gagged. He just hoped if the Marauders were back they'd wait for him to open the door instead of trying to come in. Maybe if the two of them took too long doing gross stuff the Marauders would just assume Remus fell asleep and come in! That wouldn't be pleasant for anyone involved.Finally, though, at around 3am—after a lot of kissing and moaning but possibly nothing else, he couldn't be sure—the couple murmured their goodbyes and headed up to their separate dorms after another long sloppy-sounding kiss. Remus counted to thirty then wriggled out from under his chair, rushing to open the entrance. He glanced around, waiting for any signs of his friends and, when there were none, returned to his seat.Yuck, he thought, crinkling his nose. Then, What would it be like to be kissed? He couldn't imagine kissing a girl in any way, but part of him kinda wanted to try it one day if he could... except if he didn't want to kiss a girl, how would that ever work?Then a super bizarre thought about kissing boys flashed through his head which he quickly dismissed. That was ridiculous. It wasn't—it didn't happen, it was wrong, he knew that much. What little he had read or heard about... that sort of thing happening... was most definitely negative. Cezary Quickquill, for instance, famously locked up with a Dementor by his wife when she caught him with one of their male servants. Marius Dutton and Patrick the Poisoned—Marius turned into a frog by his father when he and Patrick were caught together... and Patrick, obviously, poisoned. Incidents like that sprinkled through history, barely mentioned, hardly mattering except for the fact it proved one thing: it was wrong. Bad. Good wizards didn't do things like that. It was disgusting. Perverted.He felt like absolute crap for even allowing such a—a horrifyingly repulsive thought pass through his head though he knew (oh, boy, did he know) you couldn't really control thoughts sometimes. At least he could push it aside and return to his book, figuring the odd tingly feeling going through his body was due to fatigue. He hoped his friends would get back soon so he could go to bed.Except when he finally did—after the Marauders returned at around four in the bloody morning, him grumping, them all giddy—he thought again about some of the wizards (and witches though those seemed to be less common) and wondered briefly if it was really right for those like Cezary to be punished so severely, and why those who did the punishing were regarded as good and right. It... sorta... kinda... felt a little bit... like those who killed werewolves being regarded as heroes.But that was again a silly thought (ridiculous!) and he began reciting potion ingredients he was supposed to be studying until he fell asleep./\/\/\/\/\Remus told the others about the couple snogging in the common room the next day and they all burst up laughing then began asking him all sorts of questions, mostly curious how far they had gone. He admitted he didn't really know as they were out of sight..."But it sounded disgusting!" he complained.That set off a long conversation about girls and kissing, making Remus regret bringing it up a bit. Sirius and Peter especially seemed keen on what kissing might be like then Sirius let out a long sigh saying he hoped to find out soon."With who?" James asked."I dunno. Someone. Nobody in particular," Sirius replied, sticking his nose in the air."What, not Inkwood?" Peter teased.Sirius smacked him and Peter laughed. "Shaddup. No. Maybe. Okay, yeah, maybe Inkwood. She's gorgeous. But you have to think bigger.""She's got the biggest boobs in our year," James said.Sirius laughed at that. "Yeah, but that's not that I mean. Told you before, I'm going to get a fourth year girl to take me to the dance.""Yeah right." James shook his head. "I'd like to see that.""You will," Sirius replied and James rolled his eyes. "Today. I'll get a girl to ask me today.""I will give you a galleon if you manage," James said and they shook on the bet.So they waited, and Remus hoped it would happen before lunch, since after lunch he had his last makeup test with Prewett. Every time they passed by an older girl they'd nudge each other and Sirius but he didn't make his move. By the time lunch rolled around they figured he wouldn't at all, until, on the way to the Great Hall, Sirius spotted an older girl."Her," he said, rubbing his hands together. She was tall with short dark curls held back with a Hufflepuff bow, skin a few shades darker than James, and, if Remus had to admit it, rather pretty. He supposed. Sirius smoothed his hair down then marched over where she was in conversation with a boy. "Hi," Sirius said, flashing a grin, offering his hand towards the girl. "I'm Sirius Black."She looked him over, nose crinkling, ignoring his offered hand. "Did you need something?"Sirius ran his fingers through his hair. "A date to the dance actually," he said very smoothly and oozing charm.The boy snorted while the girl gave him a once-over. "Aren't you a second year?" she asked with a laugh."I'm thirteen," he replied coolly, "but I'm much better looking than any fourth year guy.""Excuse me!" the boy snapped. "I'm a fourth year!"Sirius looked at him then smiled at the girl waving his hand towards the boy. "See? My point exactly."James choked while Remus and Peter covered their mouths. The girl raised her eyebrows, and the boy gaped. Sirius kept up his smile for about four seconds of complete silence. He blinked, smacked his lips, then said, "I gotta go," before spinning on his heels and taking off down the hall. "I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE!" he shouted as he raced past them.The fourth year boy yanked his wand out and began barreling forward which sent the other three Marauders taking off after Sirius."WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?!" James shouted."DON'T JUDGE ME!" Sirius shouted back.The fourth year snarled a spell out and Remus yelped in fear seeing the light shooting past him; he tripped over nothing and slammed into the ground. The guy dashed past him, obviously wanting Sirius and Sirius only. Remus sat up, rubbing his elbow, watching the annoyed fourth year breeze past Peter, chasing Sirius around a corner. Peter stopped when the guy went past him then Pete turned, coming back to Remus, helping him to his feet."Siri's dead," Peter said."Sirius is very dead," Remus agreed."Is your friend mental?" the girl asked, folding her arms.Remus and Peter exchanged looks then chorused, "Yes."They waited around for a moment then the girl shrugged and went on towards the Great Hall. Remus and Peter waited a bit longer then went to their lunch, sitting down near the door. They had just begun to eat when James came in. He plopped down next to them, grabbing a plate as well and dumping food on it."He's in the hospital wing," he said when Remus asked about Sirius. "Oh, he's not really hurt that bad. Just got these huge antenna and these things coming out of the sides of his mouth and his skin's gone all hard and shiny. I think that dude tried to turn him into a beetle.""I cannot believe he said that," Peter laughed. "He's got a lot of nerve, that's for sure."James snickered. "He's got something all right."

Author's Note: In celebration of having a beta I decided to (and was begged to) release the chapter early. Don't worry this won't be the new update time, on Tuesday I'll release it at its normal time. Though I do want to add that I have decided to try a new schedule. I don't think I have mentioned this before, if I did sorry. I'm going to update every Tuesday and Friday and every other Sunday. So two chapters one week, three the next, etc. I think I should be able to keep this up and if not I'll go back to two. Anyway, enjoy the chapter! Which is dedicated to my new beta reader Jack :P/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus's final makeup exam for Defense Against the Dark Arts was rougher than the previous two, and it was in two parts: practical and written. After the written section, Professor Prewett had him run through a lot of spells he learned in his first year. It wasn't too difficult since he had everything pretty much down pat by now. Then Remus sat quietly, anxiously, while Prewett graded everything."Well, Mr. Lupin..." Prewett stood up, grinning. "Your final grade for your first year is now officially a resounding O."He handed the exam back with a big 119% on the top. Remus's hand shook a little as he took it. "Professor—thank you, thank you so much! I—I can't even—thank you!" He looked up at Prewett and felt a warm, pleasing sensation wash through his body.Prewett stuck his hands in his pockets, corners of his eyes crinkling. "It's been my pleasure. I told you before, you're a very bright student. I hope any future Defense teacher you have is willing to be an actual, proper teacher and not the nightmare you dealt with last year.""Thank you," Remus said again, happily tucking his test into his bag. Then the words sank in and he jerked his head up. "F-future? Are you... not... staying?" He thought of the rumors of the job being cursed, and hoped that Prewett wouldn't leave!"I'm only here for the year," Prewett replied a little sadly. "I told you before, I never had any intention of being a teacher. However, Albus really needed me so I was willing to come here for the time being."Remus just stood there, stunned. Almost betrayed. It hurt, like a tiny little knife digging in through his ribs making it almost painful to breathe. "Oh.""I am sorry... though I will take that sad face as a compliment."Remus quickly looked down. "I just th—thought that you... would be th-the permanent teacher..."Prewett sighed, leaning back against his desk. "I've grown very fond of all my students, but teaching just isn't what I desire to do long term.""You're v-v-very good at it." Remus knew he sounded like a sulky child, and regretted it."Thank you. You still have me for seven more months, remember," Prewett pointed out.Remus forced a smile on his face. "Yes, I—that—... yes.""Are you all right?""Yes, I—I'm just a little surprised that's all," he lied. Of course he wasn't all right. He had... expected... hoped Prewett would be there the rest of Remus's school days. A really cute Defense teacher that cared about his grades, and didn't treat him poorly for what he was!Well, not cute, that didn't really—That had nothing to do with it, and he didn't—It was just the girls called Prewett cute.But either way... what if the next one was like Dedenne?"It'll be okay," Prewett said, as if reading Remus's mind (maybe he could... which made the cute thing even more awkward). "I think Albus is going to be a lot more careful with future hires. From what I understand he hired Professor Dedenne before anyone knew about you, so he didn't really have the ability to... screen for anti-werewolf sentiments."Remus shifted his weight. That's true, he thought.Prewett stepped over, putting a hand on his shoulder; it sent strange sensations through Remus's body, confusing him. "Try not to worry about it. We're only partway through November, I have plenty of time left as your teacher."Remus kept the smile on his face until he left the classroom, then it faded. He liked Prewett! He didn't want him gone! He certainly didn't want yet another stranger to know his secret! And what if Professor Dumbledore couldn't find anyone to teach a werewolf? Plus Prewett was so understanding! And nice! And cool! And so good-looking (again, not that he really thought that way, well he sorta did, it was just... it was an obvious fact, that's all). He was the second best teacher ever (no amount of treasure hunts or terrific smiles would ever knock Professor McGonagall off that pedestal) and it was just... so sucky.He understood, of course he understood. Prewett didn't want to be a permanent teacher. But still.Remus moped around for a while, too blegh to do much of anything. Anytime he tried to, he just grew irritated again over the fact Prewett would be leaving at the end of the year. He fussed around the library until he stomped out to hide down a side corridor and kick at the wall for lack of anything better to do. He had no idea where the other Marauders were and wasn't in much of a mood to hang out with them anyway.Prewett hadn't said anything about not telling anyone else, and Remus doubted it was some big secret, but he decided not to mention it just in case. He knew if he hung out with the Marauders at the moment they'd be able to tell something was wrong. Lily would too. Aegis probably would as well, but if Remus said he didn't want to talk about it he suspected Aegis wouldn't press... so he went off looking for Aegis. He didn't expect to find him but at least it gave him something to do. The library was devoid of his friend, as were the nooks in the dungeons and the Great Hall; he even checked some of the courtyards despite the cold.Once outside in the eastern courtyard he kept going around to look at the mountain underneath the trophy room. He wrapped his arms around himself and stomped his feet to stay warm as he studied first the rocks then the section of the castle where he suspected parts of the passage were. What's under there? he wondered as he shivered. Was someone really tearing it up trying to find the Chamber of Secrets?This gave him something else to think about so he returned to the library. He went to the history section and began pulling out book after book about Hogwarts and Salazar Slytherin, piling them on a table. Going through the indexes, he wrote down all the names of the books along with the page numbers that referenced the Chamber. It was unfortunate there were so few, but at least there was something.After choosing one to check out, he headed to the trophy room to go into the secret passage. Scrimgeour was cheerful when he showed up, and said he had been 'quite busy' which confused Remus until he went in. Aegis was sitting on the floor with his back against a wall, a book open in his lap, and his wand lit.He yelped when Remus came through and dropped the book. "Oh! Remus, it's just you! You frightened me.""I'm sorry." Remus went over, sitting cross-legged across from him. "Have you b-been in here all day?" He had spotted some empty crisp bags and a half drunk bottle of pumpkin soda.Aegis looked a bit awkward at that question. "Most of the day. M—some of the Slytherins have been in a terrible mood today and I thought I should hide out in the most private place I could think of.""Malfoy?" Remus asked, narrowing his eyes.Aegis's cheeks turned a little pink. "Ah... well... y—yes, if you must know." He tucked some hair behind his ear then pulled the book back into his lap. "I did not even think of your friends coming in. I suppose if it had been them it would have caused trouble."Remus shrugged. "You d-don't need to tell them I told you.""That is true. Are you not spending the day with them?""No, I had my final makeup exam with Professor Prewett and when I got out I couldn't find them," Remus said, not mentioning he had purposely not looked for them. Attempting to find information on the Chamber had made him feel better, but the mention of Prewett reminded him of what the Professor had said and caused his heart to sink a little."How did that go?"They talked for a bit about a variety of topics—including an extensive discussion over electives—until they realized it was well past the time supper usually started. As they headed into the Great Hall Aegis seemed a bit jumpy which made Remus worry over just how much Malfoy was harassing him.Then Remus smiled as he thought, we should get him. Perfect! Sirius disliked Malfoy anyway, and he was an absolute bully, but it was the fact he intentionally bothered Aegis that made Remus want to get him.He said goodbye to Aegis, heading over to the Marauders who were quite happy to see him. They were even happier when he whispered his desire to prank Malfoy. "Not in his dorm though," he added quickly."Why not?" James asked.Remus glanced at Aegis then back at his friends. "I don't want him thinking it's Aegis. For some reason he seems to really dislike Aegis, and I don't want him to be blamed."Something flashed across Sirius's face that Remus couldn't figure out what it meant. But when Sirius spoke, he seemed normal. "Drat... because a hair color changing potion would be the absolute best prank against that git. He obsesses over his hair more than I do with mine!""I find that hard to believe," Remus teased. Sirius glowered at him and before he could say anything Remus quickly added, as sweetly as he could, "By the way, I am quite pleased to find you are not a beetle.""Argh! Don't remind me! My skin felt so weird! I think it still feels weird." He began poking at his cheek then scratching lightly at it. "I swear ol' Pommy didn't completely fix it.""You still kinda look a bit beetle-y to me," said Peter."Is today pick on Sirius day or something?" he demanded, throwing his hands in the air while Remus and Peter snickered and exchanged amused looks."Balloons," James said and everyone stared at him, completely bewildered."E—excuse me?" Sirius finally asked.James blinked a few times then shook his head. "Sorry. Balloons. Hair potion. Drop'em on Malfoy.""OH!" Sirius exclaimed and a few kids glanced over. "Brilliant," he added, quietly."Oooh, we could do it when, um, Silverlocke has class so that way Malfoy really can't blame him," Peter suggested."Double brilliant," Remus said, and Pete beamed.He considered asking if they could wait till later in the week so he could be there, but he felt panic smack into him at the thought of even mentioning the fact he'd be gone Monday and Tuesday nights. The fact this would be his first full moon with knowing they knew brought him a sense of dread. Sometimes when he was anxious as a person the wolf would get more violent, and he suspected this time around it would be quite bad./\/\/\/\/\Remus spent most the evening with Lily, and then afterwards with the guys where they made plans for Operation Not-So-Blonde Git, as Sirius insisted on calling it. James sorta wanted to do more exploring, but everyone else was pretty tired. Instead they hung out together until around one until the need for sleep overcame them. Well, except for James; there were a few older Gryffindors up in the common room and James stayed with them to talk Quidditch while the other three Marauders went to bed.Remus slept uneasily, having nightmares for most of the night involving his friends barging into the Hogsmeade house during the full moon. Most of them were distant and vague, but one of them woke him up screaming after ripping into poor Peter, tearing his innards out. He stared down at his hands, half expecting blood to be dripping from his claws but of course his hands were clean."Remus?" Sirius opened the curtains and climbed into his bed, ignoring his instance of being fine. He shut the curtains carefully then looked at Remus in the darkness. "You all right?""Just said I was fine." Remus mumbled, pressing his hands against his eyes. It had been about three weeks since Sirius sat up with him after a nightmare. He had told Sirius the truth about what his nightmares were about, and now he just felt awkward."You were screaming.""I tend to do that, with my nightmares—hence the sound absorption spells on the curtains," Remus grumbled.Sirius snorted and snickered. "Okay, Mr. Sass." He moved one foot to poke at Remus's leg. "Do you want to talk about it?" Remus lowered his hands slowly, still looking at them. He curled his fingers, pressing his fists against his chin and mouth, slowly shaking his head. "'Kay. Want me to talk about random crap to distract you? Or just sit in silence?"Sirius's silver eyes were locked on Remus, waiting for a reply. Remus closed his eyes, not sure what to say. What he wanted was to get the image of Peter on the floor of the house with his intestines trailing out of his gutted stomach and into Remus's mouth out of his mind. He groaned then bent forward, one hand on his mouth, the other on his stomach. Then he dove out of bed, making a beeline for the bathroom to be sick.You don't taste it, you can't taste it, it's your imagination! he told himself to no avail. Even after throwing up and cleaning his mouth out he could still taste something bloody and squishy...Sirius followed him into the bathroom, getting him a damp cloth for him to clean his face off. He did so before slumping to the ground, clutching the washcloth. He mumbled a thanks to Sirius for his help. Sirius sat on the floor, hugging his knees."S... sometimes... I... have a nightmare... th—that I've... bit someone..." he whispered shakily, not wanting to elaborate that the biting wasn't a typical werewolf bite but an evisceration and disembowelment. If his friends ever knew what some of his nightmares were like, they would probably change their tune."I can't imagine how hard that is for you," Sirius replied softly, scooting closer so his arm was pressed against Remus's arm.Remus ducked his head, not saying anything more. The warmth from his arm felt good, and he leaned against him. They sat in silence for a long time before Sirius got up, offering his hand to help Remus up. Neither of them spoke as they returned to their dorm until Sirius whispered a very quiet 'goodnight' and Remus answered with an equally soft 'goodnight'. He climbed into his bed, shut the curtains, and slept fairly peacefully for the remainder of the night./\/\/\/\/\Remus didn't sleep too well Sunday night either but for a different reason. He had weird dreams that left him sweaty and uncomfortable when he woke up, and he felt a really tingly urge to—well, he tried to go back to sleep only to have more strange dreams, this time causing him to wake up soaked in even more sweat. He gave up trying to sleep and rolled out of bed. It was very early so nobody else was awake as he stumbled to the showers, tearing off his damp pajamas before slumping under the cold water on to cool off. And to maybe wake up, since the full moon was that night and Remus was already tired. He dragged himself out of the shower and into his uniform, trudging back to the dorm as the others were getting ready."Blimey, you look awful!" Peter said as soon as Remus went in. "Are you—" He cut himself off, going rather red."Not feeling well," Remus said, trying not to look towards Spinnet and Struthers."You up for class today?" Sirius asked, looking Remus over.Remus shrugged. "I'll go to the morning classes and see how I feel at lunch.""Don't push yourself," James said, tying his trainers then sticking his feet out. "Look what I did.""Tie your shoes? Congratulations!" Sirius cheered.James glared while Remus and Peter snickered. "Ha-ha. Funny. No, my laces." His laces were now scarlet and gold. "Remus, when you're feeling better I was wondering if you could try to make them... uhhh... change color?""Change their color?" Remus asked, a little confused since James just said he had done just that. "You... did?"James shook his head. "No. I want them to be tie-dyed and move around like... you know, like swirling around all... groovy. You know.""Oh. I—I could look that up.""Only once you're feeling better," James said, standing up, still looking proudly at his shoes.Breakfast was exhausting, and Potions was awful. Some of the ingredients they were working with were exceptionally stinky for his sensitive nose. It got to the point where he considered doing something he never wanted to do: leave early. He was allowed to miss classes on the day of the first phase of the full moon... but since he really didn't want to miss more classes than he had to, he opted to stay. As difficult as it was.Nobody else seemed too bothered. A few people murmured complaints about the worst smelling ingredients, but none of them were affected like Remus. He thought again that he needed to figure out a way to cancel out scents! Between this and pranks and the Chamber of Secrets, his list of things he needed to research in his spare time was growing exponentially.At least Charms wasn't so bad; they were still working on the freezing charm. Remus had the rabbit again while everyone else was on large spiders, frogs, or mice. He didn't find it challenging to freeze the rabbit, and since it was the largest animal Flitwick had he just let Remus work on homework while everyone else practiced."Shame we're not working on bigger animals," said Lily as they left class. She had been working on the rabbit by the end of class, the only other one to get that far."I don't like working on animals at all," grumbled Colgate, hugging her books tightly to her chest."They're not real animals," Inkwood said. "They're only transfigured objects."Colgate frowned. "I know that. It doesn't change anything. Just because an object has been transfigured into an animal it doesn't change the fact it's an animal now. You give it a heart, it's a living being.""So what's the excuse for Slytherins?" Sirius joked and the girls looked at him. "They haven't got hearts.""Neither do you," snapped Lily."Ooooh, you've been on my case all day!" Sirius snapped right back. "What's your problem?""I thought that'd be obvious enough," Lily retorted, spinning around to face him. "You!""Is it because I made fun of your boyfriend?" Sirius asked.Lily went red. "He's not my boyfriend, you neanderthal! He's my friend, and frankly I am sick of the way you two treat him!""Bet you're not sick of the way he treats us!" James said, folding his arms."You deserve it!""And he doesn't?""No!"James scoffed. "Oh! So it's fine for him to say crappy things about us, and do awful things to us, but if we say or do anything to him we're bullies.""He doesn't do anything awful to you!" she said, stomping her foot."Oh! OH!" James laughed. "So last year when he exploded my glasses on my face nearly driving shards of glass into my eyeballs that was just... what? A friendly hello hi?"Lily clenched her teeth. "He wouldn't do that."James flailed his hands around his glasses. "These were bought for me after he did it! You're telling me I did it myself? Did the lenses just... what, shatter randomly?"Lily hesitated. "Well—""Well what? Not to mention he's an absolute wanker towards Remus!""You and Black are the ones who instigate everything!""What? I don't investigate anything!""IN—STA—GATE!" Lily said loudly and slowly. "Blimey, you're an absolute dunderhead, aren't you?"James threw his hands in the air. "You mumble the words then blame me for not hearing properly, sounds about right! You tend to like putting the blame on others!""I do?! You're the one who—""I don't do anything—"They were in each other's faces, shouting back and forth while everyone else watched with a mixture of amusement, irritation, and horror. Lily threw out something that happened on their first train ride to school, something about James and Sirius insulting Snape from the first moment. James retorted they hadn't insulted Snape, they had insulted Slytherin, so Snape insulted them. Lily shouted back that Snape had been insulting Gryffindor, not them, and if they, at his insistence, had been insulting Slytherin and not Snape then why did they take his insults against Gryffindor so personally? Then, apparently, they had called him Snivellus."Fine—FINE! If you're going to dismiss the train ride then our first real encounter with that git was when he insulted Sirius to his face!" James flung an arm out towards Sirius. "He said horrible things!""You called him Snivellus on the train!" Lily spat out."So that gave him the right to say—" James stopped then pushed his glasses angrily up the bridge of his nose. "So that gave him the right to say what he did to Sirius? Cause we called him Snivellus once? Nuh-uh, I don't think so—""What is going on?!"They were silenced by Professor Flitwick, who had left his classroom to find the entirety of the Gryffindor second year class in a circle around James and Lily. Flitwick stared at James, and Remus realized with horror that James had, at some point during the argument, got his wand out."Mr. Potter!"James quickly slid his wand back in his pocket. "I—I wasn't—""You were going to hex me!" Lily said, stepping back."No! It was just reflex—""Six points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter," Flitwick said."For what?! I wasn't doing any spells, just because I had my wand out? That isn't fair!""And four from Gryffindor for you, Miss Evans," Flitwick continued, ignoring James. "Four each for the argument, and two extra to you for getting your wand out."James somehow found a way to look both exasperated and guilty at the same time. "I wasn't going to do anything," he said, with considerably less wind in his sails. "I wasn't."Sirius snagged his sleeve. "C'mon, let's go."Sirius pulled James away with Peter following. Remus paused for a moment to glance at Lily. He was worried she might be mad at him considering how angry she was with the others, and was relieved when she gave him a smile. He smiled back before hurrying after the others. He was very curious about what Snape had said about Sirius. He didn't know what started their vicious rivalry... he just assumed it was because Snape was in Slytherin and particularly gitty. As they walked he inquired about the incident, angry to find out that Snape had apparently basically called Sirius a dark wizard and called him crazy, insinuating that he'd snap and lash out."He's horrible," Remus agreed."Well, we did insult him first," Sirius said."No we didn't," James argued.Sirius grinned. "Yes we did. You challenged him to a duel, remember?""Pffft. Challenging to a duel isn't an insult," he said, flapping his hand to dismiss such a thought. "Anyway, challenging someone to a duel isn't ground for them to say things like that."Remus had the suspicion there was more to it than that, but it was still horrible for Snape to say those things. Insulting Sirius by highlighting the fact he was a Black just didn't sit well with Remus. He knew some of the things they said about Snape weren't great either, but every time he felt guilty about it he would remember some of the things Snape had done or said to him without any attempt at an apology. Not that the Marauders ever apologized—Except no, Remus had given an apology once... albeit fake... but Snape hadn't known at first and just laughed to Lily about the apology. So even if he were to actually apologize, Snape would just probably laugh again.Remus sighed as they sat down in the Great Hall. He knew he needed to do better, to not hold such a grudge against Snape or even Spinnet. He knew he was a terrible person for doing it. When I get back from the moon this time, I'm going to try to become a better person. But then another flare of anger made his stomach churn as he thought of Spinnet trying to use the full-body bind on him after a nightmare and the vicious things Snape hissed out to Remus. He put food on his plate and just poked it, trying to figure out if he could be a good person and still feel such resentment towards them! He thought about asking his friends but he knew they'd all just confirm that hating Snape was A-Ok. Maybe he could talk to Lily? Not about Snape, obviously, but possibly about Spinnet. Not now, though. After the moon."When do you have to go?" Peter asked after they finished lunch and were headed up to their dorms."In about…" Remus glanced at James's watch, "a little over an hour I need to leave around two hours before sunset, just in case.""Two hours?" James asked, and Remus nodded. "Wow. Where do you go?"Remus rolled his eyes. "I'm not telling, and please don't follow me.""We won't," Sirius said."You've done it before," he pointed out and Sirius looked a little surprised. "A few weeks ago, when you hid under James's cloak? When I pretended it might have been Mulciber and Avery?""You... knew that was me?" Sirius asked."Yes. I was completely unnerved!""I just... I was curious where you went Tuesday nights," Sirius muttered, rubbing the back of his neck. "I know I shouldn't have done that.""No, you shouldn't have," Remus said stiffly. "But I'm not mad about it.""How come you didn't outright say you knew it was him?" Peter asked, frowning. "You blamed the Slytherins.""I couldn't exactly explain how I knew it was him—""How did you know?" Sirius interrupted.Remus raised his eyebrows then reached up, tapping the end of his own nose. "I could smell you." Sirius blinked a few times then raised his arm to sniff at his armpit. Remus couldn't help but laugh. "Not like that! Everyone smells differently.""I use the same soap as James though," Sirius said."Yes... but... your shampoo is different, and your natural scent is very different.""Natural scent?" James asked.Remus sighed, not intending to get into a big conversation about this! "Everyone smells different," he repeated. "I can recognize your scents very easily. Same with Lily, and Aegis, and my study group, and Struthers and Spinnet. I kinda know the other girls..." Then suddenly he felt awkward talking about this, talking about how people smelled and the fact he could do such a thing. He ducked his head, tugging at the hem of his jumper. It was so weird..."That's so cool!" Peter exclaimed and Remus glanced up."Yeah, that's really neat," James agreed. "You said your sense of smell was good but—that's so neat!""It... is?"Sirius plopped his hand on Remus's head, tousling his hair. "Very," he said with a grin. Remus yanked away, quickly smoothing his hair back down."It's like you're a superhero, like in the Muggle comic books!" Peter said, pumping a fist in the air. "Like you can tell who someone is without even seeing or hearing them."Remus felt a little bit better about himself… or at least less weird which was good enough. Then when it was time to split up and he realized he didn't have to lie he felt even better. He could pack a bag openly, putting clothes in as well as books, and didn't have to figure out whether it would be best to say it was himself or his mother although he did ask them to let Lily know he was ill.They parted, the three of them heading to History and Remus heading to the hospital wing. He was on edge as he went through the doors, feeling kinda buzzy. They know, they know what I'm doing tonight, they know what's going on...! There wasn't anyone else there so Pomfrey was able to take him to the tunnel right away, taking him all the way through to the house.He read for a while before stripping off, putting everything in the very battered wardrobe that looked like it wouldn't hold up much longer despite Professor McGonagall fixing it.Naked and chilly, he sat in the living room with the tattered remains of a blanket wrapped around himself, waiting for the sun to set...

Author's note: body horror/gore in the first couple paragraphs, after the first /\/\/\/\/\ there isn't much description of gore./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Howls turned into screams as Remus transformed back in the morning. His bones shrank and morphed, twisting from canine to human. Fur shrank, disappearing into his skin. His tail retreated back into his body, pain radiating from his lower back. His hands grew, the wolfy toe beans stretching out into fingers, his thumb shifting forward, the claws shortening and lightening into fingernails. He cried out as the last bits of his body finished changing then he lay there in agony. He knew at once something had happened to his leg. It hurt bad.Slowly he sat up and saw deep gouges that went through to the bone, muscles exposed, blood oozing out. Huge chunks were ripped out. It looked as though some madman went wild with butchering the leg although he supposed that was technically what happened. He reached down, hissing when his fingers made contact with the flaps of skin. Merlin, Merlin... It was so bad. He was kinda surprised he even had any leg left.He shifted his other leg which was injured although thankfully no where near as bad, and he was able to use it to push himself backwards. His arms were hurting, gashes all up and down, and bite marks deep into his right wrist, tearing the tendons making it agonizing to move and impossible to use to get up off the floor. That meant there was only one way to get himself to the bathroom. Fighting back the sobs rising in his throat he began using his good arm and leg to haul himself along the floor. His destroyed leg twisted and shifted with each movement and it took every last drop of effort to push forward, leaving a glistening trail of blood behind him.It took what felt like forever to get to the bathroom where he collapsed, panting heavily with the exertion of forcing his broken body through the house. He was dizzy, and felt ready to black out any second. After fighting against the desire to give up, he managed to push himself up onto the toilet. He picked up the piece of chalk debating whether to lie or not. He'd only have sixish hours there, really. It wasn't worth it. His leg would not heal before sunset.everything fine some slashes but i can bandage themHe swallowed as he wrote the lie out then pulled himself to the shower. He yelped when the hot water hit his leg then grit his teeth against the pain as his blood swirled down the drain. His vision went swimmy then everything went black./\/\/\/\/\He woke up to see Madame Pomfrey's face over him. He frowned, blinked, then rubbed his eyes but she was still there. She was bandaging up his bad leg, making huffy sounds as she did."M—Madame Pomfrey?" He glanced at the chalkboard to make sure he had written that he was fine and it was still there! "Errr... wh—what... did...""How did I know?" she asked and he gave a meek nod. "I didn't. I came here to check up on you. I planned on doing that from time to time. Last month I was getting ready to come check on you before realizing you hadn't written any message at all on the chalkboard." She gave him a dark look as she finished his leg and moved to his wrist. "When you insisted you were asking for help. I knew you were lying that day, and you're doing it again.""I was... I thought—I thought I was okay," he mumbled.Pomfrey glowered at him. "You most certainly did not, Remus. You lied."He bowed his head. "Yes, ma'am," he whispered.She helped him onto his good leg then helped him into hospital pajamas, not saying a word about his nudity. "Are you able to walk or do I need a stretcher?" she asked, her voice very clipped."W—walk." He didn't want to talk to her, he didn't want to even look at her. He had been caught in his lie, and she was mad. Of course, she had every right to be. He leaned against her, half hopping as they made their way to the trapdoor. It only took a few attempts before pain overtook him and, despite her best efforts, he collapsed to the floor. He tried not to cry as she put him on a stretcher.Neither of them spoke a word.When they got to the hospital wing she had him pull down his pajama bottoms so she could rewrap his leg, the bandages already soaked through. She remained silent, even after bringing him a chocolate shake. He was so hungry and wanted to ask for a second one, but didn't dare. Just muttered his thanks and then lay down, shivering under the blanket. He couldn't believe how stupid he had been! Even though he knew he was right (it was ridiculous to come back!) guilt ebbed around the edges of his brain; probably the only reason it didn't consume him was due the majority of his thoughts were focused on how much pain he was in./\/\/\/\/\He woke up to a tap at the door, sitting up a bit as Pomfrey came in to inform him his friends were there and asked if he wanted to see them. Remus was very confused, since the Marauders knew he wouldn't be there! He said yes, and she let in James, Sirius, and Peter, all of whom looked as shocked to see Remus as he was to see them!All four quietly said their hellos, waiting for Pomfrey to leave. She shut the door and Remus quickly held up a finger so nobody would speak. He could hear her right outside the door, her soft breathing and the sound of her heart beating; soon, however, she seemed to decide that the Marauders weren't going to cause chaos and the only sound he could really hear was her retreating footsteps."What are you doing here?" he whispered, dropping his hand as they crowded around his bed; Peter and Sirius sitting on the edges and James at the foot."We didn't think you'd be here," Sirius whispered back."We always try to come see you when you're in—when you say you're in here," James said, keeping his voice down."We didn't want anyone getting suspicious of us not coming so..." Peter trailed off and shrugged. "Here we are.""What are you doing here? I thought you said you stayed... wherever it is you stay?" Sirius inquired.Remus sat up a little more and Sirius immediately reached over to help him get the pillow adjusted. For some reason, this made Remus feel very embarrassed and awkward. "Ah, normally I—I do but... well, I hate coming back here, I hated it all last year," he explained, plucking at the blanket, "especially this time of the year when there aren't many daylight hours. It's very... tiring. So this year Professor Dumbledore said I could stay at—er, stay where I stay even in the day. Professor McGonagall put up a blackboard which connects to a blackboard Pomfrey has, and every morning I write if I am okay or not okay. If I'm okay, I stay there. If I'm not, she comes and gets me.""You weren't okay today?" James asked, brow furrowing.Remus looked down. "I told her I was but she came to see me and saw I had lied.""What do you mean not okay though?" Pete asked, leaning forward. "I thought you heal up?"Remus looked at his right wrist and reached over, curling his fingers around the bandage. "I do, it's just slower when it's... from myself..." He looked at each of them, then pushed the blanket down. Carefully he rolled his pajama leg up so they could see the bulky bandages, only showing the ends so they didn't see how blood-soaked they were or how far up they went. Sirius frowned, James let out a sharp breath, and Peter whimpered. "I couldn't put weight on it," he said, deciding not to go into just how destroyed it was. Tried not to show how much agony he was in, how much he was fighting back screaming from the pain."Why did you lie?" Sirius demanded hotly and for a split second Remus thought he meant just now, then realized he was talking about lying to Pomfrey, not to them."I—I don't like coming back!" Remus hissed back, pushing the pajama leg back down and whimpering in pain from using his right hand. It still felt awful. "I have to go back in about two hours and I'm not healed up. There's not much point in me shuffling back and forth!"Sirius narrowed his eyes and Remus thought he'd say something about Remus's physical condition. Instead he asked, "How far do you go? It sounds like it's quite the hassle."Remus averted his gaze. "It... it's not in the castle, that's all I'll say. And yes, it is a hassle. I prefer staying... there. But Madame Pomfrey came to check up on me despite what I said and found out I lied. So. She dragged me back here."Peter started to reach towards Remus then withdrew his hand. "Ooh, sorry, I was just... um, your wrist... is it bad too?"Remus lifted his hand, supporting his wrist with his other hand. "Yes..."I can't believe I'm sitting here talking about my wounds, discussing the fact I ripped up my own body like this! He felt like he had been dropped in some sort of freaky alternate universe! Panic and fear started bubbling up, swelling up inside of him, pressing at his lungs; he let out a small cry, automatically reaching up with his right hand to cover his mouth. The movement sent a jolt of pain through his wrist."I'm f-f-fine," he gasped out when they all expressed concern. "I'm fine.""What happened?" James asked, tilting his head. "Do you need Pomfrey?"Remus let out a slow breath. "I've said before it will take a long time for me to come to terms with the fact you know. It's—ahh, I'm trying. It's difficult.""We've been... very worried about you," Sirius said, very softly. He reached out like he was going to touch Remus's shoulder, but withdrew his hand."None of us got any sleep last night," Peter added then he began blushing. "But that's not—it's nothing compared to your—I didn't mean to sound rude, I just—""It's okay, I know what you meant," Remus promised.Sirius opened his mouth to say something but there was a quick tap outside the room before the door opened. It was Professor McGonagall and she looked furious. Her eyes darted towards the other Marauders, pressing her lips thin, trying not to look quite as mad. "Good afternoon, boys. I need to speak with Mr. Lupin privately. You may come visit him later, if he is feeling up to it."The Marauders all hugged Remus gently, saying their goodbyes and giving McGonagall curious glances as they left. Remus tried to keep a smile on his face even after they left, but involuntarily shrank back when McGonagall turned back towards him. "G—good afternoon, P-Professor," he said shakily."Good?" She looked down at him, eyes flashing with fury. He wasn't sure if he had ever seen her this angry. "Do you have any idea why I'm here?"He looked down at his lap, folding his trembling hands together to at least attempt to prevent them from fidgeting too much. "Yes," he said. Of course he knew why. How could he not, with her fury so apparent? It was going to be bad, and he tried to steel himself for the worst."You lied to us. You lied to Madame Pomfrey.""In my d-defense I didn't realize how bad my leg was," he said before recoiling at the severe look in her face."I have a hard time believing that, Mr. Lupin. Poppy told me the extent of your injuries." She flicked her wand, pulling the chair out of the corner and closer to his bed, then sat down. "Most of us involved were adamant against you remaining in the house during the day. You're only twelve, and you're usually injured when you wake up. We trusted you to tell us when you needed help, and you've broken that trust."Remus closed his eyes, nauseated from the overwhelming knowledge of how much he had messed up. He wished he could say or do something to fix the situation but there was nothing! He had done precisely what she was accusing him of and that made it so much worse.Then it got even worse."I am very disappointed in you."McGonagall was disappointed in him…That hurt more than his leg or any wounds he could have given himself. Disappointed!His nose itched and his throat tightened as the tears welled up; he pressed his fingernails into his palms to try to prevent them from spilling over. What else did he expect? He had been caught in his lies. He wanted to apologize, but knew if he opened his mouth and tried to speak it would result in a flood of tears."I'm sure you understand we're going back to how things were before," she continued, since he hadn't spoken. "Madame Pomfrey will be coming to get you every morning. Even if you are in perfect health when she comes to you, you'll be returning here.""Yes ma'am." The wolf rose inside of him as he struggled to contain his emotions; he could hear his voice shaking, and hoped she couldn't tell how angry he was. Or… how angry the wolf was? Sometimes it was hard to tell the difference. Either way, he was on the cusp of losing control and he couldn't let that happen. "I... I'm sorry..."She pinned him with her gaze. "I don't know if I can believe that at the moment, Remus. I suspect you're only sorry that you were caught.""I don't like coming back here!" he blurted out, unable to stop himself. McGonagall looked startled. "I—I know why you feel I should but—but these don't do much!" He lifted his hand, indicating the bandage. "I can do it myself! And—and in winter months there's hardly any time between c-coming back here and going back there, and it's exhausting, and I won't be healed b-by the t-t-time I—I—" He stopped, realizing how pointless it was. These were the arguments he gave prior to all of this, and they weren't enough to make up for what he had done.McGonagall gave a small sigh when she realized he wasn't saying anything else. "I understand. Perhaps we will look into trying this again in your third or fourth year."Remus's stomach flipped. Fourth year?!"Yes, Professor," he forced out, knowing it would be useless to argue further.She left the little room, shutting the door behind her. As soon as it closed Remus curled up, pressing his face into the pillow and hating himself for screwing up so badly./\/\/\/\/\When Remus returned to the house in Hogsmeade (limping, leaning heavily on Pomfrey as he hadn't healed up just like he figured) the first thing he noticed was the dried blood everywhere, including the long streak from that morning where he had dragged himself across the floor. There were also chunks of shriveled flesh laying about.After Pomfrey left and he got himself to the bathroom the second thing he noticed was the blackboard was gone. It was a punch in the gut, even though he knew it would be taken away. The empty spot in the bathroom was like a beacon highlighting his mistake.It was even rougher after the sun set and he remained a boy, his leg aching. He heard heavy sleet against the house and knew it was supposed to turn into snow at some point during the night. He curled up next to the fireplace with a few blankets around his bare body, trying to stay warm. All the blankets were ripped into and had holes so he arranged them as best he could, trying to get them so they'd cover each others holes, but there were still a few spots where the cold air came through.At one point, when the winds were particularly loud, he almost felt that pull from the moon but it faded after a moment. Wrapping the blankets tighter around himself, he rolled over a bit closer to the fireplace and tried to get to sleep. He managed to get a few moments of shuteye, however that resulted in vicious nightmares of tearing open his friends' legs, waking him up with a jerk which often caused his own leg to start aching again.When Pomfrey came in the morning he was dressed in his uniform, sitting on the couch with a book in his lap and his leg nearly healed. She smelled of snow, and sure enough when they went past the Whomping Willow there was a light blanket of snow over everything. Like the previous winter, Pomfrey used a spell so they wouldn't leave footprints coming and going from the Whomping Willow.Despite not turning into a wolf, he still felt completely exhausted and went to the little room in the hospital wing to rest for a while. He drank the shakes Madame Pomfrey brought him and thanked her, but other than that they didn't really speak to one another. Remus wanted to apologize again but...At least this phase was only a two moon stretch, so he wouldn't be going back again and he'd be able to attend his afternoon classes. Although one of those classes was Transfiguration and the thought of seeing Professor McGonagall made his stomach all squirmy. He could still feel her disappointment. Even though he was super hungry, when lunch rolled around he only managed to eat a little. Almost as soon as he started he could hear Pomfrey arguing with the Marauders in the main wing. She told them that he needed rest, though he was doing better and might be at classes later in the day but only if they stopped harassing him.He remained in the hospital wing until close to History. He considered skipping History... all he'd be missing was Binns lecturing from the book. He wouldn't really learn much that he couldn't on his own. But he got out of bed, put on his clean uniform, and headed to class, still limping a little bit."Remus!" Lily squealed when she saw him outside the classroom. She jogged over and hugged him. "You're feeling better?""Much," he said, brushing his fringe back."You weren't in the hospital wing very long."He smiled. "No, it didn't really—it wasn't so bad this time around." Hah! That was a lie."I'm so glad to hear that!"When the Marauders came in they stared in shock at the sight of him before running over to give him hugs and pats on the back, generally being very noisy and concerned about his return. They probably would have just hovered all around him if they didn't have class and weren't forced to sit at their desks.As Binns droned on, Remus fought to stay awake. He was still tired from the night, though it helped to get notes from his friends. All three wanted to know how the night went and he wrote back that it was fine and that it was cloudy so he hadn't changed. Almost as soon as he passed it along, he grew paranoid for even writing that and wrote a quick note asking them to destroy the notes please. He saw James tearing Remus's notes up and setting it on fire right there on his desk. Remus dropped his head in his hands, forgetting entirely who he had been dealing with and feeling dumb for assuming they'd wait until after class.Twycross began shrieking and Sirius grabbed his history book, slamming it down on the tiny fire to put it out."YOU'RE ALL ABSOLUTELY MENTAL!" Twycross screamed.Binns faltered in his lecture, peering around at the outburst. "Miss Twinecut, is something the matter?""Black and Potter set their desk on fire!" She brandished a finger, pointing at the bits of ash.Binns blinked, looking at James's desk. "I don't see a fire," he said, then began lecturing again. Twycross harrumphed while James and Sirius snickered, though Lily chewed them out after class for setting something on fire. James shrugged, saying it wasn't bad, and it was put out easily. Then Remus stepped between them because he didn't want to fight for what felt like the millionth time in a week. He reminded them they had Transfiguration and should get going. Thankfully they both listened to him, and they all headed to Transfiguration though Lily kept giving James dark looks over her shoulder.They seem to be fighting more than usual, he thought miserably as he took his usual seat in Transfiguration. He wondered if there was anything he could do to fix it but doubted he'd be able to. James hated Lily. Lily hated James. That's just the way things would always be./\/\/\/\/\"So, it wasn't so bad last night?" Sirius asked as soon as the four of them were alone in their dorm. They had been crowding around him the entire trip, fussing over him, ignoring his quiet protests, and making it clear they were very worried the past two nights. He had figured they would be worried... but not that much!He explained as best he could that heavy cloud coverage meant he didn't change, but it still was a rough night. He explained that when he remained human he was barely able to sleep, and when he did they were full of awful nightmares which always woke him right back up. He downplayed their severity since he didn't want them worrying more, though he felt a twinge of guilt for lying. "I got perhaps an hour of sleep total before the sun rose," he said, blinking to fight back the sleepiness."Is that... worse?" Peter asked.Remus shrugged. "I dunno. Maybe. I don't... get hurt... but... it's also very exhausting... and very boring since I can't do anything but lay there. No," he added when Pete asked if he could maybe read. "If I turn into—well, if I change I'd... destroy the book probably.""You don't have somewhere you could put the book if you... er, start?" James asked."No. I s—suppose I could sit by the wardrobe and put the book in if I started to feel—" He stopped, then continued. "But it'd probably be awkward."Sirius eyed him. "Wardrobe?"Remus averted his gaze, tugging at his sleeve, not saying anything else about that. "At least when I do... ch-change... I don't remember the night. It's not a long stretch of waiting and having difficulty sleeping and being super cold...""How come you were only gone two nights?" Peter asked. "Usually you're gone longer. For that matter, how come you're usually gone for so long? Doesn't the full moon only last one night?""Not... necessarily," he replied, yawning. "It depends on what you factor as the full moon. The full moon really only lasts a tiny short amount of time, not even a full time, if you want to get very specific. However it's... it's like how the full moon works for potions and plants. When you need to pick a plant under the light of the full moon, or pour a potion. For most magical purposes the full moon works when it's pretty much full. Like. 99% full or something close. It's the same for the curse." He thought for a moment. "Next month it will be three. It's usually three nights.""It's not more than three though... is it?" James wanted to know."Um. S—sometimes," Remus admitted and saw three identical frowns. "It was four nights in June. And March. Thankfully both when I was at home, not at school." Although he wasn't too sure about it being better that he had been home, since he much preferred the house in Hogsmeade over the cellar at home. He felt nauseated thinking about how next time he'd be in that cold, dark, empty room."We should let you sleep," Sirius suddenly said, studying Remus's face. "Crap. Last time we didn't and you—well, we'll let you sleep.""Oooh, right," whispered Peter."I'm all right," Remus promised, a big yawn betraying his words. "It's not as bad as last time. Last time was..." He thought of the multiple transformations in one night and shuddered. "Last time was very bad.""You should still rest," Sirius demanded."Before you go to sleep, though..." James fetched a wrapped package out from under his bed, and handed it to Remus."What's... this?" There was a note stuck to the top. For Our Remus."Open it!" Peter urged, jumping from foot to foot.Remus opened up the box to find some chocolate bars, a handful of rather squashed flowers, and some cloth. He picked the cloth up and when it unfolded he realized it was a pillowcase."It's got a super high thread count," James explained. "Feel it."Remus gasped out when he pressed his cheek against the fabric. It was soft! "Where...? Why?""It's a care package," Peter said excitedly, clapping his hands. "From all of us! Though James bought the pillowcase. I hope the flowers are okay, they were my idea."Remus took the flowers out, smiling. "They're great," he promised. He put them in the water glass by his bed, pouring some water in, hoping they'd perk up a bit. Then he took his pillow out of his old pillowcase and put it in the new one. "All of it is great but you—""Didn't have to," all three chorused, grinning when Remus glared at them."We know," Sirius chuckled, "but we wanted to anyway.""Deal with it," added James. "And enjoy the pillowcase. It's the same brand I get. It's also enchanted to stay cool during the night.""That must have been expensive!" Remus cried out. He knew it'd be pricey with a high thread count, but enchanted as well?James stuck his tongue out. "Too late.""But why?""It's... you know, like I said, a care package," Peter said, "for the past couple nights."Remus didn't know what to say in response to that. A... care package? For the full moon?"Now get some rest," Sirius ordered, pulling James and Peter out of the room.After they left, Remus set the chocolate bars on his desk, resisting the temptation to eat them; he knew he'd probably fall asleep after only a bite or two. He struggled a bit getting his shoes off, eyelids drooping with each passing second. Finally he gave up and just flopped back against the cool pillowcase, sound asleep within seconds.

Author's Note: The FULL chapter title is "Can't Catch Feelings If They Can't Catch Me" but it was too long for this site. I debated changing the title but it's just WAY too good a title so I figured an A/N would work ahaha/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus didn't get much rest before supper, however he did head down to the Great Hall for a little bit of food before the study group started. He wasn't sure whether he wanted to go, but as tired as he felt he decided he should; he missed several classes and wanted to stay caught up. Outside the library, Aegis was sort of hovering around with his books clutched to his chest, and when he saw Remus his eyes lit up."I saw you at supper," he said, taking a step forward. "I was very pleased to see you out of the hospital wing so soon.""Yeah, it wasn't so bad this time around," Remus said."I'm glad to hear it. I know last time was exceedingly rough for you."Remus nodded, a little startled to realize it had been a month since finding out the Marauders knew! It felt like... well, sometimes it felt like it had been a lot longer, other times it felt shorter. So much had changed while so much had stayed the same..."I tried to visit yesterday, however Madame Pomfrey said you were unable to have visitors," Aegis continued. He paused, seemingly trying to figure out how to ask what he wanted to. Finally, "Are you able to have visitors at all? I don't mean to pry, I'm just curious. If you cannot then I shan't try again.""I—I can, sometimes," he said. "It depends. I need a lot of rest so there are times when I'm sleeping and she doesn't want to wake me up."Aegis pierced him with his stare and Remus was a little worried he'd start asking questions about his illness. "All right… I'll try next time. Although, hopefully that won't need to be anytime soon. Or at all. Though I suppose that is wishful thinking...""Perhaps a bit, but hopefully," Remus agreed.As they went into the library Remus wondered if Aegis or Lily—or anyone else—ever suspected the truth. That he was a monster... Did they believe his lies about his blood disease? About his mother? Neither of them seemed as adamant as Sirius used to be, so he really hoped they were just blindly accepting his word. Maybe he should try to look up diseases that would fit his situation in order to give it a name. He supposed he could make something up but there was always the chance of someone digging into his story and knew it would just cause more anxiety over it sounding believable enough... especially since he didn't really know much about diseases period.After their studying session ended Remus didn't walk with Lily like he usually did. Instead, he wandered to the medical section of the library (seeing a couple copies of Your Body At Hogwarts but there was no way he'd ever be able to check it out without dying of embarrassment; buying from a stranger who wouldn't see him again was bad enough!) to look for some books on diseases. He found a really thick tome that listed out various illnesses and diseases with short summaries. A Compendium of Afflictions and Ailments. He tucked that under his arm then found another book called So You Want To Be A Healer. He took that one too, just in case he needed a cover for why he wanted the disease book.Mr. Farrow glowered as Remus signed the cards, mumbling under his breath about kids checking out expensive, delicate books that were too advanced for them—obviously referring to the compendium.Remus struggled to hold back a tart reply. If we're not supposed to check books out, what's the point of the library? he wanted to snap, but somehow managed not to. He thanked Farrow and stormed out of the library. Part of him did sorta understand Farrow's feelings about books being precious and needing to take the utmost care for them. The librarian's fears of sticky fingers and dripped food and uncaring students who messed up books were perfectly sound. After all, while there were plenty of spells to clean books, it was a precise, complicated magic (in order not to mess up the ink on the pages too). It was just... he seemed to take it too far. He should be encouraging learning instead of complaining about the kids, and if he had such a problem with kids then he shouldn't have taken the Hogwarts librarian position in the first place!In Remus's opinion it was sorta the same with Filch, who obviously hated the students. Why take a position in a school? Perhaps caretaker and librarian for Hogwarts were the only jobs they were able to find, but it just felt a little illogical./\/\/\/\/\Remus stayed up late working on homework and doing research on diseases. He kept yawning but just when he decided to go to sleep he heard Sirius get out of bed and leave. Remus heard him outside in the hall, shuffling... away from the bathrooms? Remus blinked and closed the book, pushing it under his pillow (which was getting quite crowded between two books and Gwyllgi), and getting out of bed. It was nearly two in the morning, where would Sirius be going? And without James and the cloak? He put on his slippers and crept after Sirius.Remus found him down in the common room, sitting in a window seat, staring out the window. At first Remus felt a pang at how much it reminded him of him but then he realized the window was open and Sirius had his arm out, flicking the flipendo spell out the window! Remus was about to ask him what he was doing then changed his mind, not wanting Sirius to jump and possibly fall out the window. So he tightened his bathrobe around himself, crept a little ways up the stairs, then exaggerated his footsteps in an attempt to make up for how muffled his slippers made them.Sirius was watching the stairwell when Remus emerged. "Did I wake you up?" he asked, lowering his arm."No, I was still up," Remus said, going over. Sirius made room on the window seat but Remus was uncomfortable with being by the open window so he sat down on the chair next to it. "What are you doing? Attacking owls?"Sirius smiled. "No. The moon.""Wh—what?" Remus spluttered, looking past him at the brilliant moon in the sky, a few clouds drifting past. "You can't attack the moon.""Maybe not with that attitude," Sirius replied a little haughtily then flicked his wand. "Flipendo!" The spell shot out into the sky then fizzled out.Remus drew his feet up onto the chair, wrapping his arms around his knees. "Sirius...""What? Flipendo.""Sirius."He lowered his wand. "Just makes me mad," he muttered, running his fingers through his hair. "Your leg and wrist yesterday. You've looked awful the past couple days, even now you look terrible. And then—when you told us today you didn't... you know... last night I was really happy but then you said it's worse because—I can't even imagine it. Having to just... and hardly able to sleep, knowing any minute you might..."Remus lowered his gaze. "I'm used to it.""You shouldn't be," Sirius hissed out, swinging his legs around. "You shouldn't be at all." He was getting angrier with each word, his voice growing tenser. "You were four. Four!""Sirius—""It's not fair!""No, it's not!" Remus snapped then quickly lowered his voice, hoping they hadn't awoken anyone. "It's not. You think I'm not mad about it? I'm angry every day of my life but I can't change it. There's nothing I can do. I have to live with it. I have to. And—and sending the knockback jinx in the general direction of the moon when we're two hundred and thirty thousand miles away from it won't do anything."Sirius frowned. "It makes you feel better."Remus pressed his lips thin.Sirius gestured towards Remus's wand, which was sticking out of his pajama pocket, then pat the window seat. "Try it."Remus let out a sigh but moved over, climbing up next to Sirius, ignoring the wriggly feelings inside of him that grew when he took a seat close to his friend. "Flipendo," he said, shooting it towards the moon. He watched the light streak across the sky—farther than Sirius's spell went—before fizzling out."Well?"Remus rolled his eyes, but smiled. "Maybe a little."Sirius smiled back and elbowed him. But then his smile faded. "There has to be something we can do for you.""You're doing it," Remus whispered, moving away from the window and the castle-height fall to the ground; moving away from Sirius in the hope that it would stop the quivering in his stomach. "You're still my friend, you're not... you don't hate me. You're not disgusted. You don't want me to be locked away or killed. That's helpful.""That's... basic human... respect...""And I'm not a human," Remus pointed out. Sirius scoffed, shaking his head. "No matter what you try to convince yourself, I'm not."Sirius slumped back, scowling and pouting like a little kid. He kicked at the seat a bit, huffing, then finally asked, "What about a calming potion?"Remus pressed his fingers against his forehead, feeling a headache coming on. He really shouldn't have been up this late after not getting much sleep, and didn't really want to discuss this. "I've tried it before, it does nothing.""What about—""Sirius, please," he begged softly, and Sirius fell silent. "My parents tried everything they could. All sorts of potions and antidotes and this and that, and nothing works. Nothing.""There has to be something," Sirius said stubbornly.Remus stood up, brushing his bathrobe off, ignoring him.Sirius got up as well, seizing Remus's wrist, preventing him from walking off. "We'll figure something out that will help you, I swear," he said with the blind confidence of a thirteen year old boy.Remus wanted to shake him out of that surety, irritated that Sirius kept insisting that he could fix things, that he knew better; knew better than Remus who had been living with this for nearly a decade. Irritated that Sirius was taking it upon himself to be some sort of hero when it wasn't his curse! He didn't transform violently into a wolf every month, he didn't live day to day with the burden, he didn't—His shoulders slumped as he forced his emotions back down. He couldn't get angry—shouldn't get angry. He had no right to... not with what he was. They were his friends despite him being a monster, and he wasn't in any position to complain. Besides, Sirius was only trying to help and he knew if the situation were reversed he'd want to do the same."I appreciate your desire to help," he settled on saying.It was still very infuriating, but it also felt pretty good knowing how much Sirius wanted to do what he could for Remus. After all, just being Remus's friend was more than he ever expected. It was like what happened when they talked to Miss Fawley: it was nice having knights. As long as they were being genuine about it and not doing it out of pity. He didn't think they were but..."Are you going back to bed?" Remus asked when Sirius finally let go of his wrist."Not yet.""All right. G'nite.""Goodnight, Remy."/\/\/\/\/\The next couple days were spent catching up on homework, Marauder stuff, study group, spending some time with Lily, carefully sifting through the book on diseases, and trying to get some rest but by the time Saturday morning rolled around he still felt exhausted and wanted to sleep in. But he couldn't sleep in too much since he needed to take the Transfiguration exam he missed Monday, so he forced himself out of bed, stumbling around as he got ready for the day. The other Marauders were already long gone for breakfast though they were still in the Great Hall when he came in.Peter complained about not having anyone to hang out with during the morning since James and Sirius had detention at the same time Remus had his test; Remus half expected Peter to just wait outside the Transfiguration classroom since his test wouldn't take too long but apparently that wasn't the case. Halfway through someone knocked at the door, and when McGonagall opened the door there stood one of the substitute teachers with Peter in tow. Professor McGonagall told Remus to continue working then stepped outside without shutting the door all the way. Remus listened in very easily. Apparently, Peter had tried breaking James and Sirius out of detention by causing a ruckus down the hall to distract the teacher. James and Sirius got away, but Peter had tripped and was caught. What did Professor McGonagall want to do?She gave Peter detention, said she'd deal with James and Sirius later in the day, then returned to the classroom. Remus bowed his head, returning to writing as if he had been doing that the entire time she was outside."Mr. Lupin..." He glanced up at her. "Do you know where Misters Black and Potter might be?"Remus slowly shook his head. "No ma'am. I—I think they had detention, didn't they?" he asked lightly, trying to sound like he had no idea what just happened."It seems as if they disappeared," sighed McGonagall as she sat back down. "I apologize for the interruption, please continue with your test."Remus returned to the tower after the test, keeping an eye and an ear out for the Marauders but not finding them anywhere. When he got to his dorm and found they weren't there either, he merely kicked his shoes off and flopped face first into his bed, intending on taking a nap. He had just drifted into a light sleep when someone tapped at the door. He jerked awake, nearly falling out of his bed. Who on earth would have been knocking?!"Whaa?" Remus asked, choking a little on some drool that had formed in his mouth in his near-sleep."Remus?""Lily?" He went over and opened the door, seeing Lily standing there looking miserable. "Are you all right?" he asked.Lily shrugged, rubbing her elbow, glancing past him. "Are you alone?""Yeah. Uh, c—come in..." He shut the door behind her, very worried. "What happened?""Nothing. What makes you think something happened?" She crossed the room, picking her way past all the discarded clothes and objects littered across the floor, and hopped up onto Remus's desk.Remus nervously followed. "I can tell something's wrong." He nearly asked if Snape had done something but managed not to. "If you feel like talking about it I'm willing to listen, but if you want to talk about something else we can do that too." He thought for a second, thinking about how he felt a lot of times. "If you just want to hang out in the room together and not talk at all, that's okay too."Lily gave him a half-smile, tucking some hair behind her ear. "Th—thanks..." She twisted her hands in her lap and bit her bottom lip, then hunched forward, hands now flying to her face. "I don't know what's wrong! I woke up feeling awful and sad and I can't stop. It's stupid. that's all. I thought having someone to chat to might distract me..."Remus hurried over, climbing up onto the desk next to her. "There's nothing wrong with feeling like that." He then gave a quiet yelp as she twisted around, burying her face into his chest."I'm sick of it, sick of it!""Sick of... what?""Everything! Of—of always being looked down on because of my blood, of my stupid sister, of Cassie never shutting up about snogging, of stupid Potter and his—his stupidness, of Sev being so afraid of anyone in Slytherin guessing how close we are, of everything!"Remus awkwardly pat her back, having no bloody clue what to even say. "It's okay to feel this way," he murmured.She pulled away, her hair sticking to her face from a few tears. "I'm just so frustrated right now.""Did something happen to—to start this?" he asked, wondering if he needed to get someone with a prank."No... I don't know." She pushed her hair off her face and slumped back against the wall. "I dunno why I'm feeling so miserable. I should go. I didn't want to talk to Cassie cause as I said she's been annoying me, and I didn't want to upset Alice, so I come here to bother you?""You're not a bother!"She glanced at him out of the side of her eye. "A crying girl on your desk isn't a bother?""Not when it's you," he promised, and she smiled. "Honestly, Lily, I'm not, only worried.""I dunno," she said again, shaking her head. "Do you ever just feel... bleargh?""Yes," he said right away. He scooted a bit closer to her and leaned close enough that their arms touched. He wasn't in a particularly bad day when it came to touch but he would have done it anyway since he knew Lily liked comfort like that. "I... I feel that way a lot...""Oh, Remus, I'm sorry!" she said suddenly, pulling away in order to look him in the face. "I'm being so—so callous!"Remus frowned, tilting his head, extremely confused. "Uhh... you're not?""Yes I am! You're—you're..." She trailed off and then gave him a poignant look. "You know, you're ill, and here I am complaining about nothing so awful as that! And you were sick earlier this week. I'm sorry!""No! No, it's fine!" he said quickly. "Just because I'm sick doesn't make whatever you're going through any less! It's—it's—it's not a competition. Please don't think like that. I don't mind you complaining."She reached down, taking his hand. "I don't know what I'd do without you."As she spoke, the door swung open. Remus had heard footsteps out in the hall but he hadn't given them much thought, and now the other Marauders were coming into the dorm. James came to a halt, Sirius and Peter running into him. They all stared at Remus and Lily sitting on the desk, holding hands.They immediately let go of one another, their hands springing apart. They hadn't been doing anything but Lily began turning beet red, while James began whooping and Peter giggled."Sorrrrry!" James laughed. "We interrupted you two!""Should have put a sign on the door!" Peter added from behind his hand."St-st-stop!" Remus stammered, feeling his face heating up. "It's not—we weren't—Lily was just—""Honestly!" Lily got off the desk, sticking her nose in the air. "You lot are so immature! I hope you choke on your supper tonight, James Potter!"He gave her the two finger salute, blowing raspberries as she marched past them. Remus watched her go, hoping she'd be okay.As soon as the door swung shut Peter whirled around, eyes enormous. "Did you two kiss?!" he squealed."What?! No!" Remus got off his desk, hoping he wasn't as pink as he felt. "She was upset and needed to talk.""Is that all?" Sirius asked, sounding considerably less amused than the other two. Actually, he was frowning. James and Peter were snickering at one another, James smacking Pete's arm.Remus glared at them. "Yes! We are friends!""So, no kiss?" James teased, making loud kissy sounds.Remus grabbed his wand. "Rosodorus!" he snapped, and James began sneezing rose petals. Peter laughed harder and Sirius joined in, and James was the one glaring now."TraaaiiiAAACHOO!—ters."James had to go to the hospital wing to get the hex removed since Remus refused and Sirius and Peter weren't very good with the general counterspell when it came to things like that. Sirius went with him, so Remus asked Peter about the detention thing. Peter made a face and explained he was supposed to cause a distraction so James and Sirius would be able to sneak away but he had been caught, and James and Sirius just got more detention."Are—are they even surprised?" Remus asked, stretching out on his bed. "I still don't understand the point of escaping detention. You just get more. What's the point?"Peter shrugged. "I'm not too sure either, but it's what they wanted."Remus snorted, picking up a book to read. "They're weird.""Definitely weird," Pete agreed and they exchanged grins./\/\/\/\/\Lily thankfully showed up for lunch. Remus had been feeling guilty for not going after her after James's teasing, and when he saw her in the Great Hall he went to apologize. She seemed to be doing a lot better and shrugged at his apology, not annoyed at all that he hadn't gone after her. She had gone straight up to the girls' dorm which meant even if he had tried he wouldn't have found her anyway."I'm glad you're feeling better," he said as they sat down to eat together."Me too. I don't know what was going on earlier," she replied. "I guess everything caught up to me all at once. I am sick of everyone thinking..."He waited but she didn't say anything else. "Thinking what?"Lily rolled her eyes so hard he half expected them to pop out of her skull. "That we're... you know.""We're...? Oh!" He winced a little, sorting out what she meant. "Yes, it is very irritating.""I have four best friends and two of them are boys, what's so wrong with that?" she demanded, smacking her fist against the table."Nothing. Trust me, I don't understand it either."Lily looked down the table and Remus followed her gaze. Colgate and Inkwood were actually sitting with the Marauders. Colgate didn't seem very interested in chatting but Sirius and Inkwood were deep in conversation, Inkwood giggling quite a lot. Lily snickered then began flicking her hair back. "Oh, Sirius, you're just soooo cute!" she said in a giggly sort of voice. Remus covered his mouth, trying not to laugh. "Your arrogance is such a turn on!" Remus put his other hand over his first to stifle his laughing more. "I dream about the way you brush your hair!""St-tooop!" Remus snorted, choking a bit. Then straightened up as Mary Macdonald approached them, asking if she could join them."Of course," Lily said, making room."What were you doing? You looked in pain," Macdonald said, eyeing Remus."Lily was—well, I w-was laughing th-that's all," he replied, shaking his head."I was joking about Cassie and Black," Lily explained, jerking her chin towards the pair. "They're flirting."Macdonald raised her eyebrows, eyes going wide. "Ooh. Well, Black is very good-looking," she breathed out.Lily groaned. "He's a dung beetle. And Potter's a worm.""Potter's cute too," Macdonald said."Maybe you should see Madame Pomfrey about getting your eyes checked," Lily said, and Macdonald giggled. "I swear, if Cassie does start dating Black I am going to scream. She can do so much better.""Sirius isn't th-that bad," Remus argued, finally unable to stop himself from speaking up for his friend. "He's a great g-guy. And surely even y-you have to admit his hair is nice."Lily pulled a face. "I suppose."Macdonald grinned. "His hair is gorgeous. I wish mine looked that good! And his eyelashes are so long."She looked dreamily down the table as Sirius bent in to whisper something in Inkwood's ear, causing her to shriek and smack him while he laughed. His grey eyes were lit up and his smile was broad, obviously enjoying whatever discussion they were having. Remus felt a bit of a twist in his stomach, not feeling very hungry anymore.Suddenly Colgate was sitting down next to Remus, dropping her plate down. "They're being annoying," she explained irritably."Flirting that much?" Lily inquired. Colgate stuck her tongue out, gagging loudly."Weren't you c-calling them a cute couple j-just the other day?" Remus asked.Colgate pushed her glasses up, exchanging awkward glances with Lily. "I did, yeah," she admitted. "But just because they'd make a cute couple doesn't mean I want to sit there listening to them flirting."She wasn't alone in her thoughts, because within a minute James and Peter moved down the table too, both of them complaining about Sirius and Inkwood."Is it that b-bad?" Remus asked, his heart sinking and his stomach churning. He watched the pair who obviously didn't care they had been abandoned by everyone else."Worse," grumbled Peter, settling in on Remus's other side, and James next to him."What will you do if they end up seeing each other?" Lily asked James.James paused, fork halfway to his mouth. "Congratulate them?" He shrugged and popped the food in his mouth. "If he wants to date her, that's his choice," he added after swallowing. "I'd be happy for'em."Remus poked at the food on his plate. He hoped he'd be able to be convincing enough if he had to congratulate Sirius for getting a girlfriend. He knew he should be happy at the thought of his friend dating but it made him uncomfortable and miserable and lonely. Which was ridiculous. Sirius having a girlfriend didn't mean they couldn't be friends. Yet it still gave him a nagging feeling somewhere deep inside. He wanted to go down and pull Inkwood away from him. He didn't want Sirius to have a girlfriend.And he didn't know why he felt that way.He considered the idea of James having a girlfriend. Or Peter. And it didn't bother him as much. He tried to convince himself it bothered him, but deep down he knew it was only Sirius that caused this anxiety. But why?Remus kept staring at his plate, not hearing the voices around him anymore. He thought of the way Sirius made him feel. Warm, and content, and happy, and... sometimes squirmy... and fluttery inside. In a way James and Peter and Lily and Aegis did not. Why just Sirius? Because he comforted Remus in the night when he had his nightmares?Remus began breathing heavily, fear taking over. Why did he feel this way about Sirius? Why did the idea of Sirius getting a girlfriend upset him, but not the thought of any of his other friends?Then, without bidding, an image flashed through his head. The image was of the other night when he thought about kissing a boy, but it wasn't just any boy, it was Sirius.Remus shoved his plate away, scrambling to his feet. He tripped on the bench, crashing painfully to the floor. Everyone was staring at him. Peter twisted around, reaching down to help Remus up."Fine!" he panted out, pushing away from Peter. "Just a—a thought—um, I need to—uh—need..." He didn't know what to say. Even Sirius and Inkwood were watching him, as well as a lot of other students. Blushing, he got to his feet. "Had an idea for—for the Astronomy assignment. I need to—yeah. Write it down." He hesitated, then fled the Great Hall, humiliated. Argh, what a weak, dumb excuse! But he had to get away from everyone's eyes. Had to get away from Sirius's gaze. Had to get away from that horrible, awful, miserable thought of—of—"Hey! No running in the halls!" a prefect shouted as Remus dashed past her.Remus didn't stop to listen, couldn't stop, because stopping meant those thoughts might come back. He ignored her taking points away from Gryffindor and just kept running, going down hidden passageways to try to avoid anyone else that might take points off. Whenever he stopped running his brain caught up with him and started thinking things again so he just ran, and ran, up stairs, down stairs, watching the floor, the walls, his feet. He tripped multiple times and ran into corners, bumping, bruising, scraping. The wounds faded though there was blood still smeared on his hands from the healed scrapes.He kept going until he tripped and was too wiped to get back up off the floor. He lay in the darkness of the secret passage, staring at the ceiling, chest rising and falling as he breathed hard. He didn't understand why his brain was thinking those things. About boys. Kissing boys. Why it felt—He groaned and rolled on his side, curling into a fetal position. It doesn't mean anything, he reasoned with himself. You always have thoughts that are irrational and aren't really what you want or think! Like sometimes on the top of the Astronomy tower when he got the urge to jump, or when he thought about sticking his hand into fire, or weird, intrusive thoughts like that he had no control over.It didn't explain the fluttery, warm feelings he sometimes felt (those probably had nothing to do with it anyway, it was too much like anxiety to really be anything else, right?) but it helped enough that he could sit upright. He examined his hands and tried to wipe the blood off on his trousers before getting up.It was just one of those irrational, unfounded, unwanted thoughts. He slowly nodded to himself, latching onto that probability like a life preserver in the middle of an ocean.Then, Oh, Merlin, I acted like a complete fool! He rubbed his forehead miserably, knowing his friends would be worried. He had no idea even what time it was, how long he had been running. Why couldn't he have realized his thoughts were absurd earlier, when he first had them? Save him the embarrassment of just running out of the room like that. Why couldn't he have been logical?Probably because they just ambushed me out of nowhere, and frightened me, he thought as he walked. He hadn't been prepared for such... unwelcome... meddlesome... random thoughts that meant absolutely nothing. Therefore when they hit him, he panicked. Now he'd be better prepared if they ever happened again.

Miraculously, Remus managed to get away with the lie he had told. All his friends assumed that yes, inspiration had just struck him and he needed to run off to work on an essay. He wasn't sure what that said about him, but at least they accepted it even if they teased him.The rest of the weekend was very cold and windy which meant James's Sunday practice was awful. It wasn't as bad as deep winter but Sirius, Peter, and Remus huddled together with Remus's blue flames to keep them warm. Sirius was squashed in the middle, and Remus felt uncomfortably aware of his arm and leg pressed against Sirius's arm and leg. Whenever weirdness tried to rear its ugly head he squashed it back down, determined to just ignore it.If he ignored it, it'd go away. Especially since they weren't really his thoughts.However the feelings part... that he wasn't so sure of. They obviously didn't mean anything either, but what did they mean? He couldn't be ill since he couldn't get ill, but perhaps it was some new form of anxiety? Maybe knowing that Sirius knew gave him weird anxiety? Though, he had been having the fluttery feeling since before he knew Sirius knew, and he didn't feel fluttery with James or Peter.Nonono! he thought fiercely, staring intently at James flying around. Don't think about it, forget about it, it's nothing.Besides, he had more important things to focus on. Like the fact the pre-Christmas Holidays exams were coming up in a couple weeks. He wasn't anywhere near as worried about them as he had been in his first year, since he now knew they weren't too difficult. But not being too difficult didn't mean slacking! He needed to be fully prepared, which meant a lot of studying. In addition he knew the other Marauders... well, James and Sirius wanted to pull a big prank at the feast on the last day before everyone left for the holidays.They didn't have anything concrete yet, except James really wanted to dump thousands of jumping mushrooms on everyone but he knew he didn't have quite enough to purchase enough to make it a funny enough prank. Remus knew part of their afternoon plans included going through the potions book to find one they could brew in time and also be good.Plus they were going to pull off several 'revenges' during the week. They had stuff planned for Mulciber and Avery, as well as getting Malfoy with the water balloon full of hair changing potion. James had ordered some since they barely had any left and it had come in the day before.So, he had plenty to worry about besides... that. And he wasn't going to worry about it. Because it didn't mean anything. Just anxiety. That's all it was. That's all it had to be because there was nothing else it could be, because why would someone make Remus feel this way? Why just one person? Why just Sirius? It made no sense, so he'd forget about it. Completely. Just ignore it.Because it didn't mean anything./\/\/\/\/\Remus didn't get much sleep Sunday night. He kept waking up feeling hot and sweaty, and very uncomfortable. It was the same sensation he had had the previous Sunday. Was something going on with Sundays?! Were they cursed for him now, giving him bizarre dreams? He wound up taking off his pajamas and just sleeping in his underwear, finally managing to get some sleep. Naturally he was quite grouchy come morning, tired and miserable. His friends were all in fairly cheery moods which made him crosser. And when they went to Potions, Remus felt even worse and considered just trying to break his own leg to get out of class. The room... stank. He covered his nose, gagging quietly as he made his way to his seat. The stench was noticeable even for the human noses."Ooof!" Sirius flapped his hand in front of his nose. "Oi, Snivellus, did you take your shoes off again?"Snape scowled, several students giggled, and Lily shot Sirius a vicious look. "Here I thought you forgot to get a shower again," she said to Sirius, causing more giggles.Sirius just smiled. "Unlike some people..."—here he glanced pointedly at Snape—"I know how to wash up.""Then why don't you take your own advice and wash your mouth out," Lily spat.Slughorn came out of the storeroom so everyone fell quiet, though Sirius and Lily kept glaring at each other. Slughorn clapped his hands and began talking, mostly about the pots of pinkish flowers on his desk which were emitting the stink. They were carrion flowers, smelling of rotting flesh. They were very important ingredients in some potions, and he wanted everyone to learn the proper way of handling them, cutting them up, etc, etc.Then he handed out masks that were magicked to filter the scents out. Remus stared at the one in front of him then slowly tied it on. Immediately most the scents dissipated, leaving a vague sort of flowery scent. He slowly lowered his hands, heart pounding. Could he... wear this for every class? It'd be odd. He knew he'd be getting weird looks if he wore the cover around his lower face every single class. Could he potentially claim... allergies or something? Or even say he did have a 'bit' of a sensitive nose? Would it be feasible? He could still smell the carrion scent very vaguely, but everyone else seemed to be completely fine.But as Slughorn began setting out the pots, the flowery scent started giving Remus a little bit of a headache. It was... strong, and in his nose. At first it hadn't been bad but constantly breathing it in was making him feel nauseated. It became cloying, and intense, and made him almost as sick as the carrion stench had. He blinked back tears as Slughorn showed them how to carefully cut the petals and leaves.The class was split into pairs since Slughorn didn't have enough plants for every single student, and they could choose their partners. Remus was, as usual, with Sirius who leaned over to whisper to James about using the petals in a prank sometime. James nodded, agreeing wholeheartedly.Remus and Sirius began carefully removing the petals from the plant as per Slughorn's instructions. There were loud squeals and gags from around the room as students cut them off since the petals felt almost... flesh-like."EWWW!" Sirius held a petal up, wriggling it. "It's like a slice of skin."Remus, who had actual experience with dealing with bits of flesh, had to silently agree. It was disgusting. This was one of the most disgusting plants he had ever come across. Once each student had three of the six petals set carefully on wax paper Slughorn showed them the best way to remove the leaves, which were bunched up together and tied at the stems. He explained the leaves had to be dried out before they were any use for potions. Then they returned to the petals, cutting them into thin strips before putting them in jars.Slughorn went around, examining the bunches of leaves and jars of petal strips, making sure everyone had done everything correctly. Remus hunched forward, feeling sicker and sicker and finally had to raise his hand to be excused to the bathroom. He walked calmly out then ran to the nearest loo, ripping the flowery mask off and taking in deep gulping breaths of air. Even if they're pleasant, strong scents right in my nose... not good, he thought, slumping down as he breathed slowly in and out.He rubbed at his temples till the on-off headache faded then returned to the Potions classroom, putting the mask back on at the door. His headache returned immediately.He suffered through the rest of class since they continued learning about the flower. Slughorn had dried leaves and dried petal strips and he showed them how to cut, crush, powder, etc. Then they made a quick, simple potion that only took about half an hour to complete using the powdered petal.The students all left their masks on the desks then filed out. Remus was very glad to be away from all of that, though the lingering scent of the flowers was on all their clothes. He wasn't sure if his friends could smell it or not, so he didn't bring it up. Then he remembered they knew he was a werewolf, and knew he had a sensitive nose, and so he could ask them—once they were alone."No?" James asked, sniffing at his sleeve."Nah, I can't smell it either," Peter said."Me either," said Sirius. "You can still?""A bit," Remus admitted awkwardly. Then, since Sirius made a comment about the mask helping, he shook his head. "The smell was so strong and right in my nose it made me feel kinda sick." He still wasn't feeling great and was very tempted to just go to the hospital wing, but he hated missing more than he already would. Besides, he doubted Pomfrey would accept him not feeling well.Professor Flitwick seemed to be thinking about the upcoming exams, as he lectured quite a bit, going over a lot of stuff they had learned that year so far. Remus took tons of notes and fought off several yawns. After class he trudged out, rubbing one of his eyes and debating skipping lunch so he could take a nap, when he noticed Peter looking very down.He wasn't the only one. "What's wrong?" James asked, smacking Pete's back."It's just so much to remember!" Peter mumbled, clutching at his satchel. "Why did he give us all of that out of nowhere?""Probably for the exams coming up," Remus said, then yawned loudly."Exams?" Peter paled. "I—I forgot all about those!"Sirius elbowed him. "How did you forget? We always have exams before the holidays!"Peter stuck his lower lip out. "I know, I just forgot! Ugh, I'm going to fail. I don't remember hardly anything he even said there.""I'll copy my notes for you," Remus said, sighing when James and Sirius both gave him puppy dog eyes. "You two too. I'll help."James snorted. "Tutu.""You lot should be grateful," said Lily, interjecting herself into the conversation since she was passing by with Colgate and Inkwood, the latter of which immediately began smiling at Sirius. "Having someone like Remus to help you. Without him you'd probably fail... considering how little you pay attention.""We are extremely grateful!" Sirius exclaimed then dropped to his knees, grabbing Remus's hands. "Oh Great and Mighty Remus, how we praise thee for your brain!"Inkwood looked unhappy that Sirius wasn't paying any attention to her, while Remus turned red since Sirius's rather loud proclamation drew the attention of all the other second year Gryffindors and a few other passing students."Get up," Remus muttered, trying to tug his hands free of Sirius's tight grip."YOUR BRILLIANCE IS NEVER ENDING, YOU ARE A FOUNTAIN OF ETERNAL INTELLECT!""Shut up!""YOU ARE PROMETHEUS BLESSING US WITH THE FLAMES OF KNOWLEDGE!"Remus finally managed to yank his hands away and stumbled back, nearly falling over, face glowing with embarrassment. James, Peter, and several other students were laughing while Sirius flailed on the ground insisting he was nothing more than an ant compared to Remus. Then he fell still, grinning up at Lily, the only one besides Remus not laughing, her arms folded."How was that?" he asked.She glowered at him, though her lips were twitching a little; she was obviously trying not to show her amusement. "Annoying."He jumped to his feet and took a bow while the other students clapped. Inkwood looked a little stiff though."I'm a bit surprised you know about Prometheus though!" Lily said, in a teasing manner.Sirius shrugged, pushing his hair back then immediately smoothing it down. "Awww, well, a lot of Purebloods know about myths. A lot of us are named after them. Like Remus," he added with a big smile, turning to Remus. Then suddenly it was if he realized Remus's name. His eyes went wide and his grin faded a little. Remus looked away, still red from the display earlier. "Though my family prefers the celestial heavens," Sirius added quickly."You certainly don't act very heavenly," Lily said.Sirius fluttered his eyelashes. "I'm named after the dog star, seems fitting to roll around and cause a ruckus."Lily couldn't hold it in anymore and she began laughing, shaking her head. "You are impossible, both of you. Come on, girls.""Bye Sirius!" Inkwood called as she left."See ya, Cassie," Sirius replied. He whirled back around, half-grinning still. "Come on, boys," he said in the same sort of voice Lily had used. They went off but the second they were down a side corridor away from people Sirius stopped and turned to face Remus who suspected what was about to be said. "Remus—""I know.""Your name—""Yes, I know.""What about his name?" Peter asked."Remus!" James said, smacking himself on the forehead. "I didn't even connect it at first!""Yes, I know!" Remus whined, hunching his shoulders."I don't get it," Peter complained."In Roman mythology Romulus and Remus were raised by a wolf," James explained quietly.Remus closed his eyes, the old familiar dislike of his name flaring up. "Lupin is also related to wolves. Lupus is Latin for wolf. Lupine is another word used for... wolfish related things.""So your name...?" Peter stared at Remus."Basically is Wolfy McWolf," he grumbled, ducking his head so his hair covered his eyes. "I mean, not quite, but bloody well close enough."Sirius snickered, very slightly. "I'm not meaning to," he said when Remus glared. "It's just... ironic."He made a face, turning away, irritated; he hadn't had a great night or morning and now he was even grumpier."Um, anyway, with what we were talking about ages ago," Peter said, stepping closer to Remus, "if you're willing to help I'd be really thankful."He was changing the subject, and that made Remus feel at least a little better. He promised he was willing, and they agreed to go over things during their free period after lunch. After, of course, they (hopefully) succeeded in getting Malfoy with the hair color changing stuff. Remus slept through most of lunch, waking up when his friends shook him at fifteen till one. He grabbed a sandwich to eat while they hid down a side corridor, filling up three balloons with the potion."Everyone know the plan?" James asked as Sirius tied off the last balloon."It's not exactly complicated," Sirius pointed out and James glared."Um, I can't remember," Peter said, tapping his chin. "Let's see, the three of us are... going to... stand there... and... throw the balloons?""Shut up," James grumbled, looking embarrassed."I'm not sure," Remus snickered. "Oh, are we going to say 'hey look out there's a balloon coming your way'?""Stop it!"Sirius, Peter, and Remus dissolved into giggles at the sight of James's irritated face. "Better hurry up," Sirius said.James put the invisibility cloak on. It was a big risk doing this, but they didn't want to just rinse and repeat the bucket of slimy slugs prank. They headed back out, everyone getting in their positions. James was extra hidden behind a nearby statue while the other three chattered about various things until they saw Malfoy coming down the stairs. Then Sirius and Peter got into a fake wrestling match, Sirius putting Peter into a headlock, the two of them spinning around and causing a 'roadblock'. Malfoy was forced to stop, a disgusted look on his face."Honestly, it's worse than chimpanzees!" he sneered before sidestepping to go around. Beyond him, Remus saw James's brown hand appearing out of thin air holding a balloon. For a brief second his heart skipped a beat as he thought there's no way this will work! Then James lobbed the balloon.Remus tried not to noticeably watch as it sailed through the air and hit Malfoy's back. He stumbled forward, shouting in fury, as another balloon hit. This one smacked right on the back of his head, and was followed by a third one.Malfoy spun around and Remus covered his mouth, seeing those white-blonde locks that were now tie-dyed pink, blue, and purple. The bottom half of his ponytail was pure, vivid pink until it began mixing in with the other colors higher up and the top of his head was just the blue and purple splotched together."WHO THREW THAT?!" he screamed.Sirius and Peter backed up, closer to Remus, all of them trying not to laugh. Other students were laughing though, so the three Marauders caved in."WHO—THREW—THOSE?!" He whirled back around, touching his hair then looking at his finger. "Water," he sneered, not realizing the liquid on his fingers had actually changed his hair color."Malfoy! Nice hair!" someone shouted and Malfoy looked bewildered then grabbed his ponytail, pulling it over his shoulder. His grey eyes went enormous as rage flooded his face. He began screaming, demanding again to know who did this.One of the teachers had come out of the Great Hall and, seeing the commotion, went down the stairs. Remus didn't recognize who the teacher was, a much older man, who was rather round though not as rotund as Slughorn. "What's going on?""Professor, someone threw..." Malfoy stooped down, picking up the bits of rubber, "I believe water balloons at me. It—it destroyed my hair! Look!" He pointed at his head and the teachers glanced up."I see," he said.Malfoy stared in disbelief. "I see? I see? Is that all you have to say!""Who did this?" the teacher asked."I don't know." Malfoy scanned the entrance hall, eyes landing on the three Marauders. "Black!"Sirius raised his eyebrows. "Hey, you got my name right. Congratulations! Do you want a prize?"Malfoy marched over, and Sirius stood his ground. "You did this!" Malfoy grabbed Sirius's upper arm, yanking him forward.Sirius just smiled. "Wish I could say that I did. It's a good look on you."Malfoy's lip curled back in a sneer but the teacher came over, putting a hand on his shoulder. "Mr. Malfoy, please refrain from attacking another student."Malfoy let go, though still fumed. "He attacked me first.""Did anyone see who attacked Mr. Malfoy?" the teacher asked and everyone shook their heads, a few students saying it hadn't been Sirius since Sirius had been wrestling with Peter at the time, and someone else said they had been facing Malfoy when it happened and they hadn't seen anyone throw the balloons. Since several people stated they had witnessed Sirius and Peter in front of Malfoy, the teacher decided Sirius was innocent. Malfoy looked very enraged about this, but didn't argue. "You'd best get to class," the teacher said."Class? I can't go to class looking like this!" Malfoy said then he finally realized everyone was staring at his hair. Furiously he yanked his robes hood up to cover the shame.The teacher frowned. "You're not exactly having an emergency. If you wish to skip class, you'll get in trouble.""Professor Talkalot, surely you can write me an excuse note," Malfoy said in a pleasant, kiss-butt sort of tone."I'll do no such thing. Dyed hair is no excuse to miss class. And I'll be sure to tell Professor Sprout why you're missing her class this afternoon if you choose to do so."Malfoy looked ready to explode now, and Sirius decided they should probably go. He began dragging Remus and Peter off, heading down the corridor that he hoped James had hid out in. They went into a secret stairwell where James was sitting, laughing so hard he had tears rolling down his cheeks. Sirius collapsed next to him, laughing too. They exchanged high fives."What I wouldn't give for a photo!" Sirius shrieked, slapping his thigh."How much?" Peter asked, pulling his camera out of his pocket.Sirius's mouth formed a huge 'O'. "No!""Yes.""You didn't!""I did!" Peter giggled. "I snuck a picture!""When?" Remus asked, not remembering seeing Peter ever having his camera out.Pete shrugged, tucking the camera back in. "When he started talking to the teacher. I got a couple."James bounced to his feet, wrapping his arms around Peter and spinning him around. "You're a bloody genius, you are!" James exclaimed and Peter flushed pink, very pleased.Peter developed the pictures before supper, making multiple copies. The Marauders all had a good laugh, and Remus took copies of it with him to Study Group. Everyone who hadn't been in the entrance hall for the prank had heard about it and pretty much everyone in the group was amused, especially Aegis. As soon as the session ended Remus reached out towards Aegis, asking him to stay a bit longer. He looked puzzled but sat back down. After everyone left Remus took the copies of the photos and slid them over.Aegis clamped a hand over his mouth to prevent himself from busting out laughing. He made muffled sounds, bending forward to press his face against the table, shoulders shaking."You d-d—didn't!" he finally managed to wheeze, glancing up with teary eyes, face pink."James did," Remus whispered."Oh, oh this is... oh." He wiped his eyes then pulled the photos close. "To be honest the colors do not look terrible, but knowing how much it irritates him makes it... glorious." He hugged the pictures to his chest, grinning. "Thank you.""Peter took the photos.""Tell Mr. Pettigrew he is a saint," Aegis said. "Mr. Potter did the color thing?""Yes. Well, Sirius and Peter provided a d-distraction. It was Sirius's idea to use the potion that changes hair color, and James's idea to do it with water balloons," he explained, doubting his friends would be too fussed about him sharing the prank with Aegis. He knew Aegis wouldn't tell anyone and that it would give him a lot of joy.He was looking at the photos again. "Did he do something to you four?""Hmm?""Why you did this," he answered. Remus coughed, looking down at his books in front of him. He began carefully prodding them to form a neater stack. "Remus?""Malfoy's a git," Remus replied, not looking at his friend and feeling Aegis's eyes boring into him. "Do we n-need a reason?" He tugged at a scrap of paper partially hanging out of a book, then began putting the books in the satchel. Aegis remained silent, eyes locked on. "All right, it was my idea," Remus admitted. "I suggested we prank him a—a week ago, after I found you in the passage."Aegis sighed, carefully tucking the photos into one of his books then putting his books away. "I suspected as much.""We figured if we did it publicly he couldn't blame you," Remus mumbled."Did you tell your friends he had been harassing me?" Aegis asked rather stiffly."No!" Remus promised. "I just said we had to be c-careful since it seemed like Malfoy especially disliked you, that's all. I p-promise I haven't told them that he's been bullying you."Aegis searched Remus's eyes then nodded. "I believe you.""I'm sorry—""It is all right. I suppose Mr. Black—well, in any case, it isn't exactly a secret Malfoy dislikes me. It's just embarrassing to think anyone has talked about me like that.""I know. I'd never.""I know," Aegis promised, smiling again. "And thank you. Truly. That was quite a prank, and hit him where it counts. And I very much so appreciate the photos since I didn't get a chance to see it in person." He shook his head, very pleased. "You know when we first started talking in Study Group I was under the assumption you were a quiet sort of... innocent who would never dare to cause trouble."Remus smiled, thinking back to how he had been at the beginning of his first year. "I was, at the time," he admitted. "I was terrified of causing any sort of trouble.""You have changed a lot since we started school. In a good way," Aegis added."I—th-thank you, I... I'm glad to hear that," he said, knowing he had changed a lot. He wondered if he'd even recognize himself in another year.He also wondered what he'd be like after a year of having friends who knew the truth...!

Author's note: internalized homophobia in this chapter/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\"Has anyone come with you this time?"Fawley's voice hit him the second he opened the door, though she didn't sound angry. Only curious."No ma'am," he said, shutting the door behind him. "Sirius has been studying books on Occlumency and Legilimency though. He's taking it..." Remus trailed off awkwardly.Fawley smirked. "Seriously?"Remus snorted, ducking his head. "Yes ma'am," he said, somehow managing not to laugh. He crossed the room and sat down on the couch. Things felt okay, this time. She wasn't giving off an angry aura and didn't sound tense or annoyed. "How... have you been...?""I've been well, thank you," she said, twisting her cane around. "I've thought a lot about things in the past two weeks. I want to make sure you understand..." Remus winced, expecting her to say something about being careful, or watching his friends, or whatever. "... how happy I am that you have such loyal friends.""You... are?"Fawley nodded. "I am. I know I haven't seemed it, and I still don't think it's safe that they know, however I also think it's not as terrible as I initially assumed. How have things been for you? How did last week go?"Remus smiled now. "I like it when it's two nights, although the second night was so cloudy I didn't change."Miss Fawley settled back against the couch. "I know those are very rough. Morrigan always told me she preferred it when she transformed to the nights she didn't."Remus sat very still. Miss Fawley never talked about her sister, not like this. The only times she mentioned her were in tandem with warnings about the Black family."Did she have n-nightmares too?" he whispered, afraid to ask, afraid of upsetting her.Fawley's face softened. "Not like you do," she said and Remus twitched. "Though on the clouded full moon nights she said she was plagued by awful night terrors any time she tried to sleep. They didn't... really affect her outside those nights, not like you, but... I know they were horrible on those nights.""They are bad," Remus agreed, feeling strange that regular nightmares weren't something that happened to all werewolves. He wanted to ask more—ached with curiosity about other werewolves—but Fawley was shaking her head, suggesting they start.The session didn't go amazing but it wasn't too terrible. He still managed the wet paper towel barrier that didn't take much to push through, and he had a vicious headache as seven o'clock approached. He also felt the slight jealousy of Sirius rise up again which he did his best to tamp down.The final memory they went through was the other night, when Remus panicked from his intrusive thoughts and went running all over the school. Fawley couldn't see his actual thoughts, couldn't see what had been going on in his head, so when they emerged from the memory she gave him a very curious look. From the outsider perspective it looked like he freaked out over nothing."I... ahh..." How could he explain? He didn't want to share the horribly weird thoughts that had popped into his head at that moment. He was very glad Occlumency didn't seem to dredge up random thoughts, like the image he had had of him and Sirius kissing—nonono don't, DON'T THINK ABOUT IT! He swallowed, then began talking again. "I got sc—scared. It's still difficult... for me to deal with the, um, fact, the fact they know." He tugged at his sleeve, hoping that sounded believable.Obviously it did because she nodded. "I imagine it will take you a while."He tried not to breathe out a sigh of relief, and wondered what she'd say if she knew the truth. She would probably be absolutely disgusted, never wanting to be in the same room as Remus again. Even though it wasn't his fault, he didn't want those thoughts. Or the feelings. Not that he understood the feelings one bit. It wasn't until after he left the classroom that he thought maybe he should have asked Fawley about the weird feelings he sometimes got. Surely there was something... wrong.He thought about it for the rest of the evening, distracted from his homework, and the next morning he woke up early. Normally he slept in on Wednesday but this time he woke up for when most students went to breakfast, getting dressed while his friends slept, and heading to the Great Hall hoping...And there she was.Remus went over, sitting next to Lily. She was reading a book, shoveling cereal into her mouth, and looking rather tired. She jumped a little when he sat down then smiled, setting her book down. "You're usually not at breakfast on Wednesdays," she said.He shook his head as he piled bacon and potatoes on his plate. "I couldn't sleep very well.""I'm sorry."He shrugged, nibbling at the bacon, trying to figure the best way to ask the question that had been bothering him; the question that he hoped she might be able to help with... "I haven't been feeling great."Her eyes went wide at that and she began frowning. "Do you need to go see Pomfrey again? So soon?""No. I mean, I—I don't think so," he said slowly. "It feels... different. It's different. Not sure what's wrong.""Can I feel your forehead?" she asked and he mumbled his consent, her cool hand pressing against his head. "I don't think you have a fever...""Sometimes I feel really hot," he said as her hand dropped away. "And my stomach feels... weird.""Maybe you've come down with a bug?""I don't... think so. It comes and goes. I feel..." He searched for the right word, not even sure if she'd even be able to help. "I feel weird. It's not quite a stomachache though. It's more like... a fluttering feeling in my stomach? And my heart rate certainly goes up." Now Lily was looking at him funny. "It feels a lot like anxiety. Like, a lot. Sometimes I get sweaty, but it's not always connected to when I get hot, and—""Remus?""—I just—yes?"She was smirking, propping her elbow on the table with her chin resting on her hand. "You said the feeling comes and goes?""Yes.""It's like when you eat gummy butterflies and you get that feeling in your stomach?"Remus snapped his fingers. "Yes, that's a good description.""You get excited, and dizzy, and warm?""Yes, I said—"She began giggling. "Oh Remus!""What?"She folded her arms, dropping her head down, giggling hard. "Poor Remus!""What?!""Surely you've had to notice you only feel that way around a certain person, right?"Remus drew in a sharp breath. Of course he had, he just couldn't figure out what it meant. "I suppose. Why? Could I be allergic to them?" That sounded absolutely preposterous! He couldn't be allergic to Sirius, could he? Could werewolves even get allergies?Lily just burst into very loud laughter that peeled through the Great Hall, getting a lot of attention. Even some of the teachers looked down. She covered her mouth to try to muffle the sounds before grabbing Remus's hand, pulling him out of the room, down to the entrance hall, down a side corridor, and into a storage room where she began laughing again."Lily, what in Merlin's name—""Remus!" she wheezed, doubled over, arms around her middle. "You're not bloody allergic, you've got a crush!"Remus stared at her in disbelief. Then he started laughing. "What? No! That's—that's ridiculous! I can't—oh, no, I—I think you've misunderstood the situation!"Lily took in a deep breath, wiping the tears from her cheeks. "I doubt it! Everything you said points to a crush.""I can't, though!" he said, the amusement dying from his voice.That was completely wrong! How could she even assume...?"Why not?""I can't have a crush on—" He stopped, biting his bottom lip.Lily's eyes shone. "On? Come on, who is she? You can tell me! I won't say a word, I promise!"She.Remus swallowed, taking a step back, body trembling. Crush? Like—like boys liking girls? And girls liking boys?She.He couldn't..."Remus?""You've... certainly misunderstood... what I said," he forced out slowly, trying not to freak out, trying not to totally freak out because she was wrong, because he couldn't have a crush on—She.Of course, Lily would say that, because he should have a crush on a she. If he got a crush on anyone it should be Lily, or—or Colgate, or Buckling, or some girl, some nice, cute girl with breasts and—and other—girly—not boy.Lily was talking, saying the symptoms he had told her, pointing out he even said it was around one person, telling him these were all signs of a crush. Then she was saying other things he never once mentioned, things about feeling awkward when they came into contact, how could she know that? How could she possibly know Sirius's touch made him all wobbly? And then she talked about jealousy, asking if this girl was talking to some other boy, and he shook his head, not wanting to hear another word, trying not to think of the betrayed feelings he got whenever he saw Sirius and Inkwood flirting."You're wrong," he said, sounding as hollow as he felt. "There isn't anyone else involved. I never said there was. I only said I supposed, but I—it's not, it's... nothing. I'm probably coming down with something."Except the fact he couldn't be coming down with anything.Lily folded her arms, raising an eyebrow. "Don't be silly. There's nothing wrong with having a crush on someone. Who is it though?""Nobody, there—there's nobody." He began backing up, heart pounding heavily in his chest, palms getting prickly. "Mistaken, that's all.""Remus—"He felt the urge to run, like he always did when he began panicking. He wanted to run and hide, to bury himself from her words, from her—accusations. Not that she meant them to be accusations, obviously boys his age developed crushes... just on girls not boys not Sirius.He jumped when he felt her hand on his arm."Are you all right?" she asked, worried."Yes," he said, voice sounding very funny. "Maybe. No, I—I think I do need to see Madame Pomfrey, I think I am sick.""It's okay to feel—""I—I'll see you later."He left the storeroom, ignoring her calling his name, just walking as fast as he could, running his fingers through his hair, leaving it sticking out every which way like James always did.Crush.That wasn't possible. Sirius wasn't...Remus wasn't...!He began walking a little faster, everything blurring around him. He went to the hospital wing, shoving the doors open, eyes darting around for Pomfrey. She came out of her office at the sound of the doors open then hesitated when she saw who it was."I don't feel well," he said, standing there, arms stiff at his sides.Pomfrey glanced around then came over closer. "What's the matter?"Lily's saying stuff that can't be true, that's the matter! "I—I don't feel good," he said again. "Stomach. Chest."She guided him over to a bed and he sat on the edge as she ran diagnostic spells. "You usually don't get sick, Remus. What happened? Is it like what happened last month? Have you had another... shock?"He wanted to laugh again.A shock? Bloody hell, he doubted anyone could have a bigger shock than being told they had a crush on their male best friend! Even if it was wrong, because it had to be wrong, because it was wrong, it was wrong for wizards to like wizards, history said so, everyone said so, it was wrong, and he couldn't because it was wrong, and Lily was just blowing everything out of proportion."Your heart rate and blood pressure are higher than normal," Pomfrey said, "however I don't see anything else wrong."He stared blankly at her. How could she not find anything else wrong when there was obviously something very wrong? It felt like there was poison seeping through his veins, burning his skin. He wanted to rip his shirt off to show her the gaping hole that had to be in his chest."I don't feel well." He pushed himself farther back on the bed, digging his fingers into the sheets."Are you... wanting to skip class?""Yes please," he said right away without another thought because even though, no, he didn't want to miss class he couldn't bear to see Sirius anytime soon.He couldn't do it.He wished this had happened closer to the holidays, closer to him being able to be away. He wanted to be away. Far away. But he still had a couple weeks before that happened, still had the pre-holiday exams, still had to deal with... what Lily said... and then seeing Sirius..."That isn't like you," Pomfrey said, scanning his face. "You must really not be feeling well to not want to go to class.""Please," he whispered, curling his hands into fists. "Please, Madame Pomfrey, I d-don't feel good, I just—I don't... I can't go to class today, I don't feel good." Lily's words, her lies slithered around like icy snakes."You look very pale," Pomfrey murmured, and retook his temperature. "You're shaking too. Perhaps it would be best to rest here awhile. You don't have class until eleven, right? We'll see how you feel when it gets closer to class.""Can I go to th-the room?" Remus whispered, glancing over at the door. "I—I don't w-want visitors."Pomfrey hesitated then frowned. "No, that's only for when you're at your worst.""Wh-what d—difference does it make?" he muttered. But he slid back until he was lying on the bed, reaching down to take his shoes off and letting them drop over the edge of the bed. His hands were trembling so hard it took him several attempts to undo the shoelaces. He wriggled under the soft grey blanket then lay down, pressing his cheek against the pillow, and staring at the curtains that Pomfrey shut around him.This wasn't fair. Why did this have to happen?! He was still dealing with the fact his friends knew, it wasn't fair to have something else thrown at him! Something else to wrap itself around his brain and lungs and squeeze everything out of him, something else to shove him down into the freezing arctic waters to drown. Why would the fates do this to him?! Wasn't it enough to be cursed? To be reviled and hated, to have to keep himself secret and quiet, terrified every waking moment he'd be found out, then—THEN!—on TOP of it all to do this to him?!He could not have a crush on a boy, much less his best friend.It was cruel. Beyond cruel.He whimpered and curled up into a ball, wishing he could reach into his brain and pluck these thoughts out of his head, throw them on the ground, and grind them into dust. He didn't want them! It wasn't right to like a boy like that! To feel... to have a crush!Maybe it's not a crush. He wrapped the blanket tight around him, feeling better with the enclosed tightness surrounding his body. He was tempted to go under the bed. But then what would it be? Could Lily have gotten it wrong? She seemed pretty adamant about the symptoms. Maybe it was just... a mutated version of anxiety?Then his entire body froze as he heard the doors open and familiar voices echoing through the room. No. They were here a lot quicker than he anticipated. He didn't dare move, didn't breathe."Remus!" Sirius called out, his voice slicing right into Remus's heart. "You in here? Evans said you were!""Maybe behind that curtain?" Peter asked.Remus stared at the closed curtains, feeling on the verge of vomiting, and he heard them get closer then—"Stop right there!" Pomfrey snapped. "What do you think you're doing?""Looking for Remus," said James sweetly."You do not go looking behind curtains in the hospital wing," she said ferociously. "That is a severe violation of privacy and if you try again I will report you to Minerva!""It's the only bed with curtains around it," Sirius said, audibly annoyed. "He's in there.""It doesn't matter who is in here, it's a violation of privacy and I will not have it," Pomfrey snapped. Peter yelped as Pomfrey began moving quickly; it sounded like she was herding them towards the doors. "Don't give me those looks. You best be glad I'm letting you off with a warning. Now go."He heard the doors shut, and heard his friends complaining loudly from out in the hall but soon their voices faded. Pomfrey swept by Remus's bed to check on him and he thanked her, since he really didn't want to see anyone at the moment."Did you have a fight?" she asked, still sounding angry. "If you're hiding here by way of avoiding them—""No!" he squeaked. "Honestly, I d-d-don't feel good."She eyed him suspiciously then nodded, shutting the curtains and returning to her office.Remus went back to staring at the curtains, trying to sort through his thoughts, trying to get his heart to slow down instead of racing a zillion miles a minute, and trying to figure out how it could NOT be a crush. He wasn't like that. He wasn't. It was wrong. It was bad! Wasn't it enough? All the other stuff? Wasn't he enough of a freak?Or maybe that's it.Remus sat up at this new thought forming in the depths of his soul.Maybe he liked a boy because he was a vile monster. Could that be it? Could it be connected to his lycanthropy, his curse? He was a disgusting beast. No matter what they said, he knew what he was and they didn't! He was, and could it be his strange feelings for Sirius were born from that? Was it the wolf within him making him have images of kissing Sirius?But... wouldn't the wolf within rather have images of chewing Sirius's hand off?Remus rubbed his forehead, mulling over this new possibility. He wasn't sure if he could blame his curse for this or not. He wanted to. Even though he'd still have to deal with it at least then he'd know he wanted these wrong things because of the darkness inside of him.He wanted to scream, to throw a temper tantrum and punch the wall until he felt better, until Lily's poison ebbed out. If it ever could.Then another thought.Sirius... was good-looking. And Remus didn't feel this way about James or Peter, just Sirius who was a self-proclaimed beauty. Maybe... he... liked Sirius... aesthetically...? Could that be it? It wasn't that he was a boy, it was that he was just so good-looking.Remus chewed at his nails, staring at nothing, this possibility turning over and over in his mind. It sounded... probable. After after, there were some really beautiful paintings that made him feel emotional but he didn't crush on the paintings. It wasn't the same sort of emotional-feelings but... perhaps since Sirius was a person and not a painting or a sunset it was different, and perhaps could be mistaken for the same feelings as a crush...?He slumped down, feeling like he might throw up. It really didn't sound very logical, but sounded more logical than him liking a boy like that. Because he couldn't. He wasn't, he wasn't. It was... wrong.He flopped back down, pressed his palms against his eyes, returning back to the whole unfairness of the situation. Why couldn't he be normal and get a crush on a girl? Maybe he could? Maybe if he thought real hard about a cute girl he'd develop a crush. The problem was, he had no idea which girl was cute. He thought Lily was pretty but not in that way, and he certainly didn't want to crush on her.But just because he didn't think any girls around him were cute didn't mean anything either, right? He could still just not be at that level of maturity yet. Your Body At Hogwarts even said that everyone developed at different rates. Maybe he just aesthetically appreciated Sirius's appearance and in a few months he'd begin to have an interest in girls in that manner...UGH! It wasn't FAIR! Why HIM?! Why the hell did he have to deal with this?! Things had been fine! Why did Lily have to say—Why did he have to ask her? Why did he decided to be curious and get a dumb opinion, because it wasn't fair, the universe truly hated him. The universe really did look at him at birth and go let's just destroy his entire life and you know what would be funny, let's do it twice!"Stupid universe, stupid fates, stupid everything," he muttered, settling for punching the pillow. He felt a wolfish urge rise inside of him and he gripped the pillow in his hands, about to rip it in half before realizing what he was doing. He let the pillow drop, scooting away from it, horror replacing that destructive urge. He had nearly just destroyed something—something that wasn't his—which was giving in. He nearly gave in.Because of all these awful thoughts! He tugged at his hair then began scratching, as if his stubby nails could reach through his skull and do what he wanted to do a bit ago. Fling the thoughts, the images, the lies, and destroy them."Doesn't mean anything," he whispered, forcing himself to put his hands against the bed, pushing them underneath him so he sat on them and preventing them from trying to claw his scalp up. "It doesn't mean anything. He's good-looking that's all. That's all."He wasn't like that.It was as simple as that. He wasn't, so whatever this was wasn't that. The feelings were simply because Sirius was good-looking. He wasn't interested in Sirius like that. He'd be interested in girls one day.Remus took in a deep, shuddering breath, tilting his head back and closing his eyes. I'm not, so it isn't, I'm not, so it isn't, he thought again and again, repeating the words over and over until they settled around him like a comfortable cloak.He may not have any control over his body and mind during the full moon but he sure as hell was determined to control it the rest of the time. Besides, that's what he was good at, right? What he had done every day of his life? Every moment? Suppress the stirring of something dark and evil inside him?This had to be easier than pushing back the wolf. Besides, unlike the wolf, if he did it enough it would probably—no, definitely eventually go away. Especially once he started being normal and liking girls. Yes. If he could fight off the wolf he could fight off this wrongness.He was not going to have these feelings about—not girls. And especially not his best friend.End.Of.Story.

Author's Note: It is the one year anniversary of when I first made Shifting Lines public, so I thought I'd get a bonus chapter out as a celebration :)/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus did not want to go to class, but Pomfrey said she couldn't keep him in the hospital wing. She gave him a potion to help ease the stomachache he had even though it did nothing, and she obviously didn't believe him that he had a stomachache since he shouldn't be able to get stomachaches except, of course, from anxiety and stress and hoo boy was he anxious and stressed out! His stomach felt like it was practically burning.Even though he was determined to keep everything shoved into a box, he was still scared of seeing Sirius. He kept having bizarre thoughts of everything coming out of his mouth even though he knew he'd never say anything. Or that Sirius would touch him and Remus would flip out and then Sirius would figure it out because Sirius was so aware of Remus and knew him so well and Oh Merlin, what if he figures it out!?Remus took in a deep breath and headed to Charms, slowing down outside the corridor and realizing he didn't have any of his school things, nor did he have the time to go get them. He crept into the classroom, relieved the Marauders weren't there yet."Hey L-Lily?" He went over to her, shuffling from foot to foot, tugging at his sleeve. "I forgot my bag. Could I borrow a quill and some parchment?""Of course." She handed him what he needed then stared up into his face. "Are you doing all right?""Mm-hmm. F—fine.""What I said earlier—""Oh, no, it's—it's fine," he said, forcing a smile on his face, hoping it looked real enough. "I really wasn't feeling well, that's all.""All right..." She obviously didn't fully believe him. "I'm glad you're better."He thanked her again then went to his regular seat. He was spreading the parchment out just as the Marauders burst into the room, filling the air with their laughter. They all cried out Remus's name, flinging themselves into their seats around him, asking what happened, if he was really okay. Remus nodded, promising he'd explain later (once he could figure out a lie), then asked Sirius if he could borrow the textbook since Sirius was the least likely to be using it."Of course," Sirius said with a smile that threatened to yank all of Remus's sense out of place but he managed to keep the box over those thoughts and feelings, and took the book with a fake smile back.So far so good, he thought then grit his teeth as Sirius leaned across Remus's desk to whisper something to James, which was something that happened often. Remus leaned back in his chair, heart pounding harder the longer Sirius stayed there. Thankfully Flitwick began class soon after, and Sirius settled back, purposely elbowing Remus a bit as he did.Nothing's changed, he told himself as he began taking notes. Everything is the same as it was when you woke up. Absolutely nothing has changed, not Sirius, not your perception of Sirius, not your friendship, nothing.That sorta helped and he was kinda able to pay attention in class. Every time Sirius leaned in close, brushed against him, or, worse, when he tugged Remus closer to whisper something in his ear, Remus felt a zapping shock go through his body. It took more and more concentration to hold the box down but he managed. It was... enormous and billowing, expanding like a balloon. But he could remain in charge of it. It wasn't as bad as the wolf; it was strong, but not as strong as the monstrous inclinations inside of him. It was pulling, but not like the curse. He could overpower the wolf, he could overpower this."So what happened?" Pete asked as soon as they left the classroom."I woke up feeling nauseated," he said slowly, handing Sirius's book back to him.James twisted around then bent in very close. "I thought you couldn't?""That is why I went to Madame Pomfrey," Remus said, raking his fingers through his hair."You went to breakfast," Sirius said flatly. "Evans told us you showed up at breakfast then left, and I heard someone else say you were sitting with Evans and she began laughing at you. If you were sick why did you go to eat? What did Evans laugh at? Was she bothering you?"Remus glared through his fringe. "I told her a joke," he grumbled, hunching his shoulders, shifting his gaze to his feet. "I went to breakfast since I thought maybe if I had some toast I'd feel better. It didn't work.""Why were you sick?" Peter asked, forehead wrinkled. "If you can't get sick...""Anxiety," he said and they gave him looks."Anxiety over what?" James asked."Lots of things," Remus said, feeling his palms getting sweaty. Why did they have to put him through the Spanish inquisition?! "The exams coming up, mostly. That sort've thing.""Us?" Sirius asked.Remus stopped in his tracks, mind whirling. Us?! What in Merlin's name does he mean 'us'?! Why would he say that?! There's no 'us' why would he even say that? "Er, what d-do you m-mean?" he managed to squeak out. Had Sirius somehow guessed? Was he saying there was an issue between them?! Did—"Because we know?" Sirius answered with a shrug. "You said before it's still giving you trouble and will keep doing that."Relief flooded through his body. Us. As in. The Marauders. Not...He wanted to laugh and managed not to, since that would undermine his claims of not feeling great. "Yes, a bit," he said. They looked distraught but didn't argue any further. Nor did they seem too bothered by the fact he was very quiet as the day progressed. He spent the free period after lunch hiding out under his bed, pretending to do homework and trying not to let the misery overwhelm him.Nothing to be miserable about, he reminded himself, doodling some leaves down the side of his Herbology assignment. Soon I'll like girls and then I'll look back at this and laugh at being panicked over thinking a good-looking person looks good.He was sure that's what it was now, and knew if he asked others—if he dared to ask others—they'd agree. Not that he would ask. Or could. Unless I can, he wondered, sucking at the end of his quill. Maybe he could? Frame it in a way that wasn't suspicious?He got the courage, later that day, to test his theory. Sirius and Peter were talking about girls so Remus asked them who they thought the best looking girl in their year was. Sirius immediately said Cassie Inkwood. Peter thought about it for a moment then agreed; either Inkwood or maybe Tanaka in Hufflepuff. James snorted, shrugged, said it didn't really matter but he supposed, probably Inkwood though he agreed Tanaka was quite pretty.Then Remus took in a deep breath. "Who do you think the girls think the best looking guy is?" He tried to ask it innocently but of course they immediately wanted to know why he wanted to know. He tried to say he didn't really care, he was just curious. It... didn't work, and they jumped to their own conclusions which were, thank Merlin, absolutely wrong."Aw, you're definitely the cutest," Sirius said, ruffling Remus's hair. "I'm sure Evans would agree."Remus ducked away, the wobbliness and hot feelings threatening to throw the box across the room. "That's a blatant lie and we all know it," he snapped, trying to fix his hair, trying to ignore how warm he had gotten, hoping it wouldn't be noticeable; what if it was? What if Sirius figured out why Remus was asking this? "I guess it was a dumb question.""I'm sure the girls think you're cute," James said, assuming the same thing Sirius had.Remus felt his face heating up. "I—I don't care about that! I was just curious! Oh, never mind, forget it. I wanted an honest answer, not—not teasing. It had nothing t-to do with me!""Eh, honestly? Sirius," James said, and Remus mentally perked up, trying his best to keep his face blank."Me? Really?" Sirius asked with false sincerity."Without a doubt," Peter agreed.Sirius puffed his chest out and smoothed down his wavy locks. "I am pretty good-looking, aren't I?""And very modest," James snorted and yelped, ducking as Sirius took a swipe. They began bouncing back and forth, swatting at each other, laughing, and thankfully ending the conversation.At least Remus had some confirmation that others considered Sirius good-looking, that James and Peter thought that. Or at least thought that the girls would say it, which was more or less the same thing... right?/\/\/\/\/\"Who do you th—think is the best looking boy in our year?"Remus and Lily were walking back from the study group, mostly discussing assignments until he managed to get the question out. He hadn't initially intended to ask her but realized he wanted her opinion too.Lily smiled. "You," she replied without any hesitation.Remus nearly dropped the books in his arms. "Wh—what?! No, you can't—that's not. What?""I think you are," she said, blowing some hair out of her eyes. "Why, is Black or Potter trying to figure out where they stand?""N... no, I was just..." He stumbled a bit, extremely flustered now. Why did she say more or less the same thing Sirius did? They only said it because they were friends, not because it had any grain of truth in there! "You c-c-can't pick me.""Why not?"He shook his head. "We're—we're friends! Your opinion is—is biased."Lily let out a long sigh. "Fine. Okay, so cutest boy that's not you?" she asked and he nodded. "Hmm. I suppose perhaps..." She chewed at her bottom lip, clearly thinking about this at length. "Ugh. Okay, if you tell him this I am literally never speaking to you again, but... Black. All right?"He tried not to grin. Both out of amusement from her annoyance at admitting such a thing, and also because it was more confirmation. James, Peter, and Lily all said Sirius, and Sirius typically self-proclaimed himself as beautiful. That was it. His feelings were only from the fact Sirius was so good-looking and it meant Remus wasn't... well, wasn't like that, and didn't have those feelings, and one day soon would be liking girls."I won't tell," he promised.Lily tucked her hair back behind her ear. "What about you?"Sirius," he agreed.Lily covered her mouth, giggling. "No! I meant who do you think the cutest girl is!"Remus went brilliantly red. "Oh." Of course. That's what she meant. Why would she ask him who the cutest boy was? "You."She gave him a look and knocked into him lightly. "If I can't choose you, you can't choose me.""Errr..." He glanced around, worried now because he didn't know how to respond. What was he supposed to say now?"Remus?""Oh." Right, cute girl. Cute girl. Arggh. "Besides you. I—I guess, um... Colgate." Lily narrowed her eyes, and Remus panicked, remembering who his friends had said. "Inkwood!" He expected that to work but it didn't; her eyes narrowed even more. "Buckling? Pierce?""You're just naming the girls you talk to!" she protested."Am not!" he protested right back. She rolled her eyes. "Just because I talk to them d-doesn't mean they're not cute.""Sooooo... what? You only talk to girls you think are cute?""NO!" he shrieked, face flooding with heat once more while Lily laughed. "Okay fine, so I was just naming the girls I talk to. Is that so wrong?"Lily elbowed him lightly. "All right, I know what you were doing, don't need to pretend.""Wh—what was I d-doing?" he asked, quite concerned."You don't want to tell me who you've got a crush on," she said and he could tell he was blushing. "A-ha! I knew it!""I'm n-not, I don't have a crush on anyone!" he mumbled. "I told you a while ago, I don't really... I'm not like—I still can't figure out girls.""Just cause you can't figure them out doesn't mean you can't have a crush," she giggled and he glared at her. "Fine, I'll stop. You don't have a crush.""I don't." Though he wondered if maybe he should pretend. Pretend to be more like the other boys, pretend to have a crush on some girl. Except the thought of liking any of the girls he knew—or even pretending he liked them—made his stomach shrivel a little.He was very quiet when he returned to the dorm, focusing on his homework. Despite trying to pay attention to only his essay, he couldn't help but half-listen to his friends making plans to prepare for their Mulciber and Avery revenge. They also discussed the prank they'd be pulling for the pre-Christmas feast, and the fact they wanted to do something to Snape before the holidays since it had 'been a little while'. They tried to get Remus's opinions but he shook his head, saying he needed to do his essays, and was also tired. He went to bed a little early as if to prove it, though he stayed up very late, staring at the ceiling.It felt as though he were slowly being lowered into a pool of heavy sadness until he covered his eyes, and cried softly, wondering again what he had done to make the universe hate him so much./\/\/\/\/\The Marauders grew concerned as Remus spoke very little on Thursday, and the dark circles under his eyes were rather prominent. Not as bad as they got from an upcoming full moon, but certainly bad enough. He kept mumbling that he was just tired, stated he hadn't gotten much sleep—which he hadn't. He had gotten maybe an hour at most, and had spent quite a long time rifling through the index of Your Body At Hogwarts to figure out if the symptoms could be anything else regarding puberty. It did talk at great length about noticing the opposite sex. He read those parts thoroughly, trying to figure out when it would activate for him but of course it was all in one's own time and other crap like that.After the post-Herbology shower he curled up in bed, hearing them talk about him. He knew he needed to tell them he could hear past the spells on the curtains, but he didn't have the energy. He didn't really have energy for anything except how angry he was at himself. Even them expressing their concern over him didn't do anything except make him feel even worse."Remus," James said right outside his curtains, "you coming to lunch?"Remus sat up. He hadn't eaten much breakfast, and hadn't eaten much the day before but he didn't have an appetite. "No, I'll catch up with you for Defense."Silence. Then..."Aren't you hungry?" Pete asked."I'm—I'm busy..."His curtains opened and Remus recoiled back. Sirius glared down at him. "You can't skip meals for homework, it's not right," he accused then scanned the bed, frowning when he realized Remus didn't have any homework out. "Are you all right?""Yes, I'm fine," he protested. "I'm not hungry. Honest."Peter sat down on the edge of his bed. "Is something going on?" he asked."Is someone bullying you? Did Snape say something?" Sirius demanded.He couldn't imagine the fallout if he said it was Lily! Even if it was inadvertent. "No, no," he murmured. "It's nothing. I'm fine. Just tired. I haven't been sleeping well. I'm going to take a nap. That's all."After a few more minutes of them trying to get him to talk more and him refusing they finally accepted his excuse for a nap and left, mumbling outside the door about bringing him back food. Remus went under his bed almost as soon as the door shut, wrapping himself in his blanket and clutching Gwyllgi to his chest.He didn't nap at all, and didn't eat much of the food his friends brought back to him. Sirius kept urging him to eat but he only managed a couple bites of the sandwich and a slice of apple. He wound up struggling through Defense and he really needed a nap after. James wanted to hunt down Mulciber and Avery but Remus knew he couldn't stay awake any longer.Sirius pulled him aside, his fingers around Remus's wrist sending warmth shooting through his body. "Seriously, if something's happened..."Remus shook his head. He knew it was more than the anxiety now. It was this bone-crushing sadness he couldn't stop, couldn't force away. It enveloped him, refusing to go away, as if he had a dementor trailing after him. It was a weight, holding him down, making everything a supreme effort. Even walking."I've barely slept, that's all. I'm really tired. I promise that's it. Please." He wanted to pull his wrist away from Sirius but he was already messing up as a friend, he didn't want to make things worse by making it that obvious he didn't want to be around Sirius right now.Sirius stared into his eyes and Remus tried his hardest not to look away. "If you need anything—""I know. Thank you. And good luck with the prank."They hadn't figured out a way to get the whizzing worm thing to work properly so they abandoned that idea for now and instead had mixed itching powder in with the sticking solution. Remus wanted to see the results but wanted to sleep more, and indeed as soon as he collapsed into his bed he fell into a deep sleep, not even taking his shoes off./\/\/\/\/\He woke up, confused about the time. As he rubbed his eyes he swung his legs out of bed, glancing around the dorm room, expecting it to be empty but Peter was in his bed, chewing gum and reading a comic book. It was already partway through James's practice. Remus asked Pete why he wasn't there and Pete shrugged saying he wanted to be in the dorm in case Remus needed anything. Then he fetched some food the others had brought up for Remus's supper, a shepherd's pie sat in a dish enchanted by the house-elves to keep it cold, although really even if it had been sitting at room temperature Remus could have still eaten it; any dangerous bacteria wouldn't really affect him.They both sat on Remus's bed while Remus ate, Peter swinging his legs, not saying anything, noticeably not saying anything. Remus set the fork down and sighed. "What?""Nuthin'," Peter replied with a smile."Obviously something." He jabbed at the pie then took another bite."We're just worried, that's all.""Were you elected as my babysitter?" Remus asked rather angrily then immediately regretted saying it, wishing he could take it back; feeling like utter crap for saying such a rude, nasty thing to a friend who was only worried. "Peter—"Peter's smile faded a little. "No. Actually, Sirius and I fought over who'd stay.""I'm sorry—""If you don't want me—""Pete, I'm sorry," Remus said, a little louder. He put the dish aside and turned to look him in the face. "I shouldn't have said that. I'm really sorry. I do want you here. And I'm—""Is it a you-know-what thing?" Peter inquired.Remus thought he might cry, wanting to answer but not knowing how. "I—I don't know," he said then covered his face.Peter put his hand on Remus's back, pressing gently. "If you wanna talk about it...""I don't know," he repeated, the words muffled. How could he explain everything that had happened within the past forty-eight hours? His confusion? His sorrow? He wished it was the full moon so he could rip himself to pieces, he just wanted this to stop. "I'll be okay.""Do you want a hug?"Remus lowered his hands, blinking. "Yes, please."Peter wrapped his arms around Remus, and Remus turned to hug back, trying not to hug too tightly but enjoying the strength from Peter's half of the hug. It felt really good, and Remus thanked Peter who just grinned back before urging him to please eat since he 'hadn't had hardly anything'. Remus picked the pie up and finished it off, hoping he'd start to feel better soon.

Remus slept pretty heavily through the night. He woke up a couple times, remnants of nightmares clinging to his consciousness before falling back asleep. He was still a little tired come morning but loads better than the night before. His friends could see a difference so they didn't harass him, thankfully.He realized when he got a letter from home it was December first, and they'd be going home for the holidays in just two weeks. Previously he hadn't been looking forward to leaving the school, but now he couldn't wait. He wanted two weeks away from everyone else, away from... all of this. From, he hated to admit, Sirius. Maybe two weeks away would clear his head. Course, he still had to endure fourteen days till then but he thought he could. Hoped he could. Especially since one of those weeks held the exams and the Marauders knew Remus threw himself into his studies at that point, so there'd be another excuse to distance himself for the time being.In Potions he had another chance to distance, as the moment Slughorn told the kids to partner up Inkwood was suddenly at Sirius's side. Sirius glanced towards Remus, and he nodded, smiling."Ahhh...""It's fine," Remus said, getting up, trying not to sound too relieved. "I can partner with someone else."Inkwood took over Remus's seat and Sirius still looked unsure, but Remus was moving away now. Lily already had a partner but Aegis didn't, and they normally didn't get a chance to partner up in class together so it was nice.Mostly nice."Wow, you are terrible," Aegis said when their potion turned multi-colored instead of grey.Remus pouted a little. "I said I should just read the instructions and prep a few ingredients." He plucked at his sleeve, wishing he wasn't as such a failure at this as he was. How come he couldn't get it? Why did he have so much trouble? A lot of it was just... memorization and for some reason it refused to stick in his head. How come he could easily recite in order the Ministers of Magic without missing one, but couldn't remember how many ounces of rose petals went into a stupid potion when the book was right there? He was good at the theoretical work for sure but the actual making of... ugh.Aegis peered into the cauldron. "Yes. I did not believe you. I knew you weren't very good in this class but—""I wasn't joking.""No," Aegis said, smiling. "Apparently you weren't."Aegis did what he could to fix the potion but he was only slightly above average in the class so they both got an A at the end. Aegis shrugged when Remus apologized, not really caring."These things happen," he said as they left. "It is fine.""You should be glad the potion didn't explode in your face," Snape said as he walked by."Why, did it see your reflection, Snivellus?" James and Peter were exiting right behind Snape.Snape glowered at James. "Is that your attempt at being witty?""Did you just call me pretty?" James asked."Wh—what?! No I said—""Well thank you, Severus, how kind of you!" James said sweetly while Peter and Remus began laughing, and even Aegis was snickering quietly."You little—I didn't—you know perfectly well I said—""Hey Evans, your boyfriend says I'm pretty," James said, turning as Lily traipsed out into the hall.Snape's face went red while Lily scowled at James. "Pretty annoying, perhaps," she said, tossing her hair back. Snape snorted, but didn't say anything, just quickly left. Lily glanced after him with a slight frown, while James made a rude gesture at his retreating back."What did I miss?" Sirius asked, coming out in time to see the gesture and Snape hurrying away."Apparently Potter wants Severus to think he's pretty," Lily sniffled.Sirius turned to James. "You might need to stop washing your hair then, mate."James shrieked with laughter while Lily groaned and stormed off. James and Sirius exchanged high fives before they headed towards their next class./\/\/\/\/\As the day dragged on Remus began to grow more and more tired, but also more and more relieved. Every time Sirius talked directly to him, or brushed against him... it threatened the box... but the box stayed.I can do it, he thought at dinner, foot jiggling under the table. I can deal with this. It wasn't as bad as he expected, not after the initial panic. Now that things were sorta... still... status quo he knew he'd be able to get through it. And once the holidays hit he'd be able to spend two weeks without anyone else around (except his parents) and then he'd really be able to get this shoved down into the—Remus sat upright.My parents. The words swept into him suddenly. He had been thinking about the holidays for a bit now but hadn't thought much of the fact he'd be alone with his parents and having to hide such a huge lie!"Re—Remus?" James asked as Remus began laughing in a mad, unhinged way.He had been looking forward to the holiday without realizing, without thinking."I'm so dumb," he managed to get out, hiccuping a little."Right, you're the dumb one," Sirius said, rolling his eyes."At the moment, yes. I wasn't—oh man." He rubbed his forehead miserably, the laughter dying."What's wrong?" James asked.Remus opened his mouth to answer then realized they were in the Great Hall and he shouldn't, so he shook his head. "I'll tell you later."The others glanced around. "Is it...?" Peter asked, and Remus nodded, assuming he was referring to his curse.Then he sighed. "I just have been sitting here looking forward to the holidays and not even realizing how... difficult it is going to be," he whispered, leaning in close so he could be as quiet as possible. The others automatically leaned in to hear. "I spent the last holidays scared they'd figure out I was keeping something from them," he went on to explain, "and now I have to keep something even bigger from them. Huge.""What are you keeping from them?" Peter asked.James smacked him upside the back of his head. "Doof. He's talking about us knowing. Right?"Remus nodded. "Yeah...""What was the secret you were keeping from them before?" Sirius asked.Remus was a little surprised Sirius had forgotten, but it had been over a month since they talked about it. "You guys in general. The fact I have friends."Peter's mouth formed an O, James frowned, and Sirius narrowed his eyes. "Oh," he said, darkly. "Right. That.""Still don't understand that," Peter murmured.Remus elected to ignore what Peter said, not wanting to discuss it again and publicly. "And now I get to spend two weeks with them holding back probably the biggest thing I could ever keep from them," Remus moaned, dropping his head down. He had been so panicked about something as trivial and silly as thinking a good-looking person was good-looking he had completely overlooked what he should really be panicking out: extreme lying to his parents. Well, not quite lying, more of... withholding the truth...?He jerked as someone put a hand on his arm. For a terrifying second he thought it was Sirius but thankfully it was James. "Hey, it'll be fine," he said in an optimistic tone. "It's not that big a deal."Remus glared at him. "Yes—yes it is—""No, it's not," James said firmly, tightening his hold. "It's only a big deal because you think it is but really it's not. Don't think about it like that, think about it like... you're still just hiding the fact you have friends, that's all.""Yeah!" Peter agreed. "Cause if you keep that secret then there's no worry about the rest of it, right?"Remus hesitated, seeing the logic in what they were saying. "Well, I...""James is right." Now Sirius did put his hand on Remus's other arm. It was warm. Warmer than James's. "Just focus on the smaller thing."Slowly he nodded. Smaller thing. The fact he had friends. That's what he was keeping from his parents, that's all. "Good advice," he mumbled, picking his fork back up. It was good advice for everything else too. For instance, just focus on the smaller things and not the overwhelming squirmy feeling Sirius's hand on his arm gave him.It was true though. The only way his parents would find out his friends knew the truth was if they found out he had friends in the first place, so it was still keeping the fact he had friends from his parents. He could do that. Yes./\/\/\/\/\Ravenclaw versus Slytherin. The school had been gearing up for the game all week, and on Saturday morning James, Sirius, and Peter all dressed in blue to support Ravenclaw. In their first year they sorta tried to get Remus to go to non-Gryffindor games though not as intently as Gryffindor games, but this time they didn't; they understood it was painful for him hearing-wise and the only comment they made was James asking, "You're not going, right?" and Remus replying, "Correct."Once the castle emptied he considered pulling a prank like he had in his first year during the final game, when he turned the entrance hall into a trampoline. But he hadn't given it much thought beforehand and there wasn't much he thought he'd be able to do in time. He didn't want to spongify everything again, that'd be boring. He wished he had the foresight to prepare something but with everything else going on... He did consider sneaking into the Slytherin dorm and doing something since pretty much every single Slytherin would be at the pitch. The problem with that was he didn't want to borrow James's cloak without permission even though he knew perfectly well James would probably be mad at him for not pulling a prank.Maybe next game, he decided, and flopped onto his bed so heavily that some of the feathers in his pillow burst out of the old seams. He scowled and rolled over. "Repairo," he said, poking at it with his wand. The cloth pressed together and he scratched at it with his nail, knowing it was only a temporary fix. He sat upright and picked up the feathers, intending on throwing them away but just as he slid out of bed he had another thought.Hmm. He studied the feathers in his hand then set them on his bed, rolling to the other side of his bed to grab his Charms book. He flicked to the index, frowned, then set the book down. Library.He hurried to the library, ignoring the scowl from Mr. Farrow, and began searching the Charms section, pulling books out at random to explore their indexes until he found what he wanted."Not at the game?" Farrow asked when Remus went to check the book out."I pr-prefer books over b—brooms," Remus answered.Farrow narrowed his eyes, studying him. "You always bring books back on time," he commented as he pushed the card over for Remus to sign. "Never leave fingermarks.""They're p-precious," he muttered, scribbling his name."Hmph." Farrow pushed the book back over to Remus and put the card in a file cabinet. "I suppose there's a few good kids in the school."Remus raised his eyebrows but didn't reply, just thanked him and left. Well that was weird, he thought as he made his way back to the dorm. That was the nicest Farrow had been to Remus ever! Maybe he's realized I don't do anything harmful to the books.On his way back to the dorm he realized, suddenly, that he felt happy again. Maybe not completely happy, but a heck of a lot happier than he had been since Wednesday. Which was something. Was it the idea of researching a new spell and experimenting? Or the whole prank thing? He wasn't sure, but either way it felt nice.Remus flopped back onto his bed and opened the charms book up to the page needed. He studied the spell carefully then began attempting it on the feathers. A few of them twitched but they didn't seem to be working. Bigger feathers are needed, he decided then reached for his pillow, pausing for a second. Did he dare? He could put the feathers back in... and it was a very old pillow... and he did have the school pillows. He twisted his pillow around in his hands then used a cutting spell to open up the seam.He dumped all the feathers onto his bed into a big pile and then began practicing the spell. It only took a couple attempts for the feathers to start properly moving and then before he knew it everything got completely out of hand."Finite incantatum!" he shrieked , diving as several feathers zoomed towards him. "Finite incantaAAACK!" He fell back and began laughing as the feathers tickled him. "Nonono! Finite—finite—" It wasn't working. "Incendio!"One of the feathers burst into flames and all the others zipped away, hovering a few feet from Remus who grabbed his satchel and ran out of the dorm, slamming the door shut. Crap, he thought as he heard the feathers fluttering around. There was no way he could take care of this on his own and he didn't want to burn the feathers in case it started a fire. I need McGonagall.He bit his lip, starting to leave then stopping. He sat down in the hall, getting parchment and a quill out of his bag to write, DO NOT ENTER! Spell Gone Wrong! and stuck the parchment onto the door. He hefted his satchel onto his shoulder then went down to wait for Professor McGonagall, not wanting to interrupt her at the game. He stopped by Moaning Myrtle's bathroom to chat with her a bit before going to the entrance hall, finding a bench to get comfortable on. He pulled a book out of his bag to pass the time reading though his leg kept bouncing with nerves.It wasn't very long. He was very surprised when kids started pouring in. It had barely been an hour since the game started... maybe not even that! He snapped his book shut and stood up, watching for the teachers."Remus!" The Marauders spotted him and hurried over. "What are you doing down here?""There was... errrr... an—an accident in the dorm," he said, twisting the hem of his sweatshirt around his fingers."Accident?" Peter asked.He shifted from foot to foot. "Yeah, it—ah, well. I need, um, Professor McGonagall, I—I c-couldn't fix it on my own.""Well what is 'it'?" Sirius asked.But he saw Professor McGonagall just then and began pushing past the other kids, heading over. "Professor! May I sp-speak to you a moment?" They peeled away from the crowd, heading to a side corridor for some privacy although the other Marauders followed. "Um. I was—was practicing some spells and... w-well I... the spells got a little... out of hand."McGonagall looked a little startled. "What spells?"Remus kicked at the floor, feeling heat rising to his cheeks. "Erm, titillatium..."McGonagall now pressed her lips thin, eyes darting towards James and Sirius then back at Remus. "I see. And was this your idea to practice the spell?""Y-yes ma'am," he mumbled, ducking his head. "They had n-nothing to do with it.""What did you use it on?""...""What was that?""Feathers," he said a bit louder."Care to tell me why you were practicing that spell?" she asked, folding her arms. Remus just kicked at the ground. "Very well. Let's get this taken care of. How many feathers?""A—a whole pillow, ma'am.""Mr. Lupin...""I'm sorry, I th-thought I could—I'm sorry."They headed through the school and James grabbed Remus's arm. "What titty spell?"Remus elbowed him while Sirius and Peter giggled. "Titillatium. It's based on the tickling hex, titillando. However—""I thought the tickling hex was rictusempra?" Sirius asked."That's a—a tickling charm. The hex is different. More complex. The titillatium spell basically enchants an object to tickle someone. Best used on something that can tickle like...""Feathers," Peter said."You enchanted a whole pillow-full of feathers to tickle someone?" Sirius asked and Remus nodded. "Bloody hell, Brains.""So what went wrong?" James asked."I'd like to know the same thing," McGonagall said, having heard every word.Remus jumped a little, not realizing she was within earshot; he had no idea how good human ears were and always misjudged. "I thought I w-was only getting a—a couple at a t-time but I guess I—I accidentally got the—the entire p-pile, and they all went b-bonkers. I tried using the general c-counterspell but it didn't work."They eventually reached the entrance to the tower where a large group of students were milling around. "Professor!" A prefect got up, hurrying over. "I sent Galinsky for you. There's—er—an issue in the common room."McGonagall sighed. "What issue?'"Feathers, attacking students," she replied.McGonagall turned a stern gaze onto Remus who shrank back, half-hiding behind Sirius. "I sh-sh-shut the d-d-door!" he squeaked.She heaved a sigh then opened up the entrance. "Miss Doyle, don't let anyone in until I say so. You," she added to Remus, "come with me."Remus climbed through after her, feeling awful. At least the Marauders followed him too. One for all, he supposed.Inside the common room were dozens of feathers fluttering around. McGonagall tried shooting out the counterspell but the feathers were so tiny it was difficult to do; she managed to get a few clumps but mostly they darted out of the way then came for the five of them. Peter yelped and fell to the floor, covering his head, while the others began shooting out the counterspell. They barely worked and soon Remus was on the floor as little feathers began tickling any exposed skin, some zipping up his sleeve."Incendo! Incendio!" he cried out, not caring so much if a fire started now since McGonagall was there to put it up. Ash began falling down.Since the counterspell wasn't working for any of the Marauders they imitated Remus, until one of Sirius's shot way far and hit a tapestry. "Whoops!""IMMOBULUS!" McGonagall shouted, flourishing her arm wildly.All the feathers froze, including the ones inside Remus's sweatshirt. McGonagall pointed her wand to the fire and it shrank down until it disappeared. "Now," she said, brushing a few feathers off her robes, "Potter, Black, Pettigrew, you finish getting rid of these ones while Lupin and I go to the dorm."Remus got up, shaking his shirt out."How do you want us to do that?" James asked.McGonagall looked down her nose at him. "Preferably not by setting the entire common room on fire. I'm sure you'll figure something out. Come on, Mr. Lupin."He followed her up the stairs where they could hear two voices shrieking and pleading. The door to the dorm was wide open and inside Spinnet and Struthers were flailing. McGonagall did the freezing spell again and the two boys slumped, panting heavily, turning to look at who had come in."This was your doing, wasn't it?!" Spinnet demanded angrily, glowering at Remus."I p-p-p-put a w-warning on the—the door!" he said, hovering in the doorway, not wanting to get close to Spinnet when he was that angry."Yeah, 'do not enter' not 'killer feathers on the loose'!" Spinnet snarled, getting to his feet."I—p-p-put—m-m-more—"McGonagall turned to Remus. "Warning?"Remus took the sign off and handed it to his teacher. "I s-s-said 'spell g-g-gone wrong' c-clearly there!"Spinnet's cheeks went very faintly pink. "I see a sign telling me not to enter my own room I'm gonna ignore it.""You c-c-can't say you s-saw 'spell gone wrong' and p-p-pret-tend I didn't—didn't warn you!" Remus got out, voice rising a bit.Spinnet decided to ignore him completely. "Professor, it's ridiculous, the dorm is all of ours.""I agree, Mr. Spinnet; I didn't say anything to indicate otherwise," she replied coolly. "However, he did give you sufficient warning that there was something amiss in the room." She then began zapping the feathers with the counterspell and the feathers drifted to the floor. Soon pretty much all of them were back to being normal feathers. "I better go make sure the common room is still at least partially intact... Mr. Lupin, ten points from Gryffindor and I expect you to clean up the messes.""Yes, P-Professor," he whispered as she walked off.He watched her go then gasped as Spinnet grabbed his shoulder, turning him around, shoving him back roughly. "What is your problem?!" he demanded, leaning down so he could get right into Remus's face.Remus backed up, whimpering as he hit the wall. "It w-w-was an accid-dent.""Oh sure, an 'accident' and not some plot of you and your friends," Spinnet hissed and Remus cowered, sorta expecting Spinnet to push him again, but Spinnet kept his hands to himself. "You know, sometimes I think you're just their little cheerleader but sometimes I think you're the brains behind everything. That's what they call you, isn't it? Brains?""Andy, come on," Struthers said, snagging Spinnet's sleeve, pulling him away. "It's over.""This time." Spinnet thankfully backed away from Remus. "What's next? Attack of the bed curtains?""S-s-sorry if some fe-f-feathers sc-cared you," Remus muttered.Spinnet froze then whipped around. Remus ducked away, hurrying out of the dorm and down the stairs. He nearly ran into Peter who was coming up to get him, and the two made their way to the common room. All the feathers were either motionless on the floor (and furniture) except for a few piles of ashes. The students were pouring in now, complaining or laughing about what happened. They all seemed to think James and Sirius had done it but none of them seemed too put off. Most seemed to think it was amusing.Remus knelt on the ground, picking up feathers and dumping them into his empty pillowcase. His friends immediately followed suit. Remus told them they didn't have to help but of course they replied that they wanted to. At around this point Lily appeared, standing over them with her arms folded."I bet you think it's funny," she said to James."Your face?" James asked, pushing his glasses up as he grinned at her. "Every time I see it."Lily scoffed then toed at one of the feathers by her feet. "These, dumbo! Why did you do it?"James got up. "Evans..." He threw an arm around her shoulder and she pulled a disgusted face. "One does not ask, why is the sky blue?—""Because the sunlight is scattered by particles in the air and the blue light reflected off of them travels the shortest therefore there is more of it making it what we see," Lily replied, picking his hand up and stepping away from him, dropping his arm. "Or do wizards not know that?"Remus snorted and tried to make his laughter sound like a cough.James groaned and got back down, sweeping a pile of feathers into the case. "Whatever, Red."Lily gave Remus a look then went off to join Inkwood and Colgate. Once all the feathers were gathered the four boys went to the dorm to finish the cleaning job. Remus was grateful they were helping but naturally he'd have done the same if one of them had made the mess. That's when he realized he had: James, with the slime spell. At least they weren't up super late and getting covered in slime for this one!

Of course, the other Marauders wanted to know what Remus was intending with the feathers and he admitted he had wanted to figure out a way to put the spell on a delay so the feathers-tickling-people would activate in the middle of the night. They jumped on this, wanting to do it, but Remus reminded them that, because he screwed up and everyone knew about it, if they attempted to do this then everyone would know it was them. They were disappointed, but still impressed by the idea."This just proves you should study less and focus on pranks more," teased Sirius."Not a week before our pre-Christmas exams I won't," Remus replied."You did though," Peter pointed out and Remus wrinkled his nose."Only a little."Though he did wonder if maybe he should start thinking more about pranks. He had so many half ideas he let dissolve into nothing because he was 'busy studying'. He thought again of writing them down and maybe... exploring the idea of developing his own pranks...Spinnet was in a foul mood for the rest of the day and once it was about bedtime he was stomping around, grumbling to himself, and shooting angry glares at Remus while muttering 'do not enter' under his breath. It made Remus a little afraid though he didn't say anything to his friends. He didn't want to start any big fight. He knew if they knew Spinnet had pushed him there would be war, so he remained silent. At least Spinnet didn't really start anything.Remus stayed up late, studying for the upcoming exams as well as studying more of the spell he had used for the feathers. Even though they wouldn't really be able to use it anytime soon, maybe in a year or two when everyone forgot they could pull it off. Though he doubted McGonagall would ever forget.He yawned and shut his book, intending to go to sleep, but then he heard the door creak open followed by footsteps padding out. Heading downstairs. Sirius? he wondered, looking at his curtains though the footsteps hadn't sounded quite right for Sirius, but who else would it be? He quietly slid out of bed, putting his slippers and a robe on, then followed him out. If he wanted to be alone he'd leave, but if something was upsetting him and he wanted company... well, at least it'd be nice to offer even if it was an emotional battle to be around him.Remus went down the stairs, quickly realizing it wasn't Sirius at all, or at least he didn't think it was Sirius. It didn't smell like Sirius had passed by anytime recently though of course he was tired so maybe he wasn't sensing things right...Oh, he thought, reaching the bottom of the steps. A figure sat cross-legged in front of the fireplace, elbows on knees, chin in hands. Remus tightened his robe then went into the common room."Pete?""Yaaa!" Peter jerked so hard he fell over, getting tangled in the blanket he had brought with him. "Remus? Don't scare me like that!""Sorry." Remus went over, sinking down onto the ground next to him."Did I wake you up?""I was already awake. Studying."Peter frowned. "It's two in the morning."Remus shrugged. "On a Saturday night. We're usually up at this point anyway.""True..."He watched as Peter got settled back into the same position he was in before, then scooted a little closer. "Are you all right?"Pete stared at the crackling flames, a crease down his forehead. "I dunno," he finally mumbled. He reached into his robes pocket and pulled a letter out, pushing it over to Remus.Remus hesitated, then scanned the letter. It was short, from Peter's mother. Angry handwriting explaining that Peter 'didn't have to' and it was 'up to him'. The tone of the missive made Remus think Mrs. Pettigrew didn't want Peter to do whatever it was. Remus glanced back up at Pete for clarification.Peter sighed and moved his hands behind him, leaning back. "Grandpa wants to take me skiing. Mum says it's Christmas so I should be at home. He says it'll be the week before Christmas and we'll be back.""She... doesn't want you to go?" Remus asked slowly."I guess not. Dad says it would be great for me and Grandpa both.""What do you want to do?"Peter frowned, the crease reappearing. It took him several seconds before finally responding with, "I don't know. I don't want Mum to be mad. But. I mean, my grandpa's crazy, you've heard me tell you, all those hiking trips this summer?" He shook his head. "Skiing sounds dangerous! You know me, I'll just fall and break my head or something.""You... don't want to go?""I don't know," he whined. "Dad and Grandpa really want me to and—and I do like spending time with him. He's crazy but he's cool in his own way. He was in World War Two, you know."Remus's eyes widened a little. "Really?""Uh-huh. Pilot.""Wow.""Yeah. He really wants me to, um, experience Muggle things. Says he's gonna teach me to drive in a few years."Remus snorted then covered his mouth when Pete shot him a look. "S—sorry! Just, trying to imagine you... driving.""Try to imagine James or Sirius driving," Pete said.Remus giggled. "Now that's a disaster."They exchanged smiles then Pete looked back at the fire. "I dunno. I'm just real torn. I mean, if I go with Grandpa and—my aunt and uncle and cousins, they'd go too, Muggles, my dad's sister's family—then we would be back before Christmas. It wouldn't be like I couldn't spend Christmas away from Mum. With Mum. I mean... Er, well—well you know what I mean. But it'd also mean pretending to be Muggle for several days and I feel weird doing that.""Your grandpa... doesn't know...?""Oh! No, he knows, he lives with us," Peter explained quickly. "He knows all about the magical stuff. My aunt doesn't. And they'd go. That's another problem. My cousins can be annoying. But I'd mostly be spending time with Grandpa.""What about your dad?""He can't take the time off. Mum's been invited but she flat out said no, she's not spending four or five days pretending to be Muggle."Remus drew his knees up, wrapping his arms around them, resting his cheek against his arm. "Pete, it—it kinda sounds like you're trying to figure out who you don't want to disappoint more than if you actually want to go or not."Peter didn't say anything for so long Remus thought he had way overstepped things and was about to apologize when Peter slumped forward. "You're right, that's exactly what I'm trying to figure out. I don't wanna disappoint either of them! What would you do?"Remus flinched a little. He couldn't ever think of when his parents were in a disagreement over what to do with Remus, or having to 'pick sides'. The only thing that came close was him returning to Hogwarts, and his dad fully on his side, while his mother wasn't. "I'm not sure," he admitted, and Peter groaned, flopping onto his back. "Do you want to ski?""I don't know. It scares me. Like, whooshing down—you know what skiing is, right?" he suddenly asked.Remus couldn't help but laugh. "Yes.""Okay, well, whoosh, down super steep slopes with nothing but sticks on your feet and in your hand to control." Peter covered his face and began wallowing back and forth. "Not magic either. Not like a broom that listens to you. But... what if I don't like it though? Going with them. What if it's awful and I'm stuck there being Muggle?""I doubt you'd be on steep slopes...""You know what would be fun? All of us going skiing. Marauders.""I can barely walk on my own two feet, do you—do you really want to put me on skis?" Remus asked and Peter grinned at him. "It would be great seeing James and Sirius trying though. There's probably magical skis though. Skis enchanted to keep you on track or... or upright.""That'd be brilliant. Never afford them, but it'd be brilliant."Remus watched the fire for a moment while the two were silent. "If you went on this trip and needed to leave early would your mother be able to come get you?"Peter pursed his lips out, squinting his eyes. "I guess. Maybe.""You could ask her, then you could at least try going and if you don't want to stay you can go home early," he suggested.Peter bolted upright and threw his arms around Remus, squeezing the air out of him. "You're so smart, what would any of us do without you? That's a great idea." He squeezed again. "You are a genius.""G—glad I could help," he wheezed out, then took in a gulp of air when Peter released him. "I just want you to be happy.""Thank you." Peter scootched closer, arm pressed against Remus's arm as they looked back at the fire. "I want you to be happy too. You frown a lot.""I—I don't—""Yeah, you do. But I know you worry a lot so it's understandable." Peter stretched the blanket out so he could drape part of it over Remus too. "If I can help with anything for you just let me know, okay?""Of course," Remus said, feeling cozy and warm half-snuggled with Pete in a blanket like this. "Actually, we still haven't taken pictures in that secret passage if you want to do that tomorrow. I—I can't really take any books home from the library but I think my mother has some art books I could maybe look through.""Ooh, right, that, yeah, tomorrow's good for me. You're really interested in the pits passage, aren't you?""I... am," he whispered, watching the flames dance."How come?"He slowly shrugged. "I'm interested in history. I'm incredibly curious about the fact there's a whole section of the castle sealed off, and that someone went around literally blasting down through the floor and into the rock. I want to know what happened. Don't you ever just... want to know things? What happened? How? Why? The facts of something that occurred sometime long before you were even born?""Remus, I can barely remember the facts of something that occurred sometime today.""I—er, well, it just really fascinates me. I want to know! And learn. Everything I can.""Oh..." Peter shifted a bit then added, "Sirius is right.""About what?""You are a nerd." Remus elbowed him and Peter giggled. "But a good one.""Thanks."/\/\/\/\/\After James's practice the next day all four of them went to the pits corridors, since they also needed to start working on the potion they intended to use at the feast before the Christmas holidays. It took about nine days to brew, meaning it would be done just a couple days before the feast. Remus miserably rode over the first impassable pit on the broom and felt more miserable knowing he'd have to do it again to go farther. He wondered what they'd say if he did finally mention the fact the broom had silver on it—he probably should—but at this point it seemed kinda silly to complain. It wasn't as if there was anything he could do about it.Sirius doodled in his sketchbook and Remus studied while James and Peter prepped ingredients and began the potion. Once it go to the point where it was just adding ingredients and stirring—a job James could do on his own—the other three went off together so Peter could take the pictures. Remus had him photograph some of the pottery, the paintings, and the tapestries as well as some minor architecture designs like the sconces on the wall and some of the design around entrances. Sirius mostly went with them to fly them over the passages since Remus couldn't fly, and Peter wasn't sure he'd be able to fly with someone else on the broom and didn't want to risk crashing James's broom."I think there's something shifty about this part," Sirius said when they were doing the dead end corridor in order for Peter to take a picture of the painting of a sleeping dragon. Its scales rippled as it slowly breathed in and out, smoke wafting from its nostrils."Something shifty about this whole place," Pete said, lowering the camera.Remus tilted his head, studying the dragon. "It's strange...""That's what I meant," Peter said."No. The dragon. It's more of an imagined dragon than a real one. It looks distinctly like a Swedish Short-Snout but—""It's red," Sirius said."What color are Swedish Short-Snouts normally?" Peter asked."Blue," Remus answered, tilting his head the other way. "Silvery-blue. Just odd they'd paint it that way.""There's loads of paintings that aren't real to life," Sirius pointed out."I know but the fact it looks so much like a Short-Snout but is the wrong color just seems odd to me," Remus said. Something nagged at the back of his head, something saying he should know what it meant... but then it faded, and he shrugged. "Ah, well, guess that's just what the artist wanted."Remus figured they had a decent amount of pictures and returned to James who was slowly feeding reeds into the boiling liquid. He fake glared as soon as they came over. "Yeah, come back almost as soon as the boring part is done.""I can take over," Peter offered, picking up the last couple of reeds.James finished the one he was doing then got up, brushing his hands off on his trousers. He and Sirius began talking about something while Remus started to turn away to go sit down. Then Peter yelped about the potion starting to bubble over and he needed help."Remus, here," James said and handed something to Remus so he could help Peter.Remus automatically reached out then withdrew his hand quickly when he realized it was James's broom. The broom clattered to his floor while James and Sirius went to pull the cauldron higher from the fire while Peter tried to get the fire to go down a bit. James glanced over his shoulder at the sound of his broom hitting the floor and frowned."Hey, why'd'ja do that!?""S—sorry!" Remus bent down, carefully wrapping his fingers around a section that didn't have any silver, and picked it up gingerly."It's not going to bite!" Jame grunted as they lowered the cauldron back onto the fire."Hopefully that didn't ruin it," Sirius said."I'm s-s-sorry!" Remus squeaked again, feeling terribly. "I—I don't think it's ruined!"Sirius brushed some hair aside, smiling. "Meant the potion. I'm sure the broom is okay."James came over and took his broom back, clearly upset. "You don't just throw brooms down onto the floor like that," he grumbled, glaring at Remus. "I thought you were taking it.""I—I—I w-w-was, I—I d-d-didn't know it w-was your b-b-broom. I'm so sorry! Is it... r-ruined?"James ran his fingers along the handle and Remus tried not to wince when his fingers swept across the silver. "I think it's fine but Merlin's beard, Remy, your fear of brooms is getting worse.""I'm... n-not afraid of... brooms..." he mumbled, feeling super awkward."Then what's the problem?" James asked, rather huffily.They were all looking at him and he shifted from foot to foot. He wound his fingers into the hem of his jumper and he ducked his head, mumbling incoherently. James asked him to repeat himself and Remus took a step back. "S—silver," he croaked out. "Your—your b-b-broom has—ss-s-silver on it."James snorted. "Yeah? What, are you afraid of silver or s—oh shit."Sirius's eyes snapped wide open and his mouth hung open a little, then he slapped his hand against his face, clearly distraught "Shit," he agreed.James stared at Remus in horror then down at his broom. "Oh. Merlin. Remus, I—oh Merlin! I didn't—I never thought—""Are you okay?" Sirius was suddenly at Remus's side. "You were on it early, you—are you okay?""What's going on?" Peter asked, still putting reeds into the potion."I'm fine," Remus mumbled, withdrawing from Sirius. He should have said something earlier, now he just felt dumb. "It's fine. Really.""What's the problem?" Peter demanded."W—werewolves and silver don't really... go together..." Sirius trailed off and looked at Remus, unsure of what else to say about it."It's dangerous," he said, trembling a little. "I... don't know exactly what... would happen. I—I think it will burn me. And I d-don't know if I'll heal from it."Peter's mouth hung open and James put his broom in its case, angrily shutting the case then he glared at the clasps which were, of course, silver. "Dumb thing!" He kicked the case."No! James, come—come on, it's fine—""Remy, I really never thought about that!" he said, turning back around. "I swear, I just never even connected the idea...""It's fine," Remus said, trying not to sigh; he was grateful for James's concern and it was nice to know they hadn't thought about it rather than them not caring, but he didn't like the fact James had kicked his carrying case. It was a super expensive item, he couldn't even imagine how much it had cost the Potters!"At the beginning of the school year," Sirius said slowly, brow furrowed, "when you were... sick... when we were trying out James's broom and refusing...""I w-wasn't sure if I could even sit on it," he said."But you have. In here," James said, waving his arm towards the pit."I figured if I was careful with how I sat on the broom I could avoid the silver sections," he explained. "And it works, I can, it's fine.""It's not though. Silver—it hurts you," James protested. "I'm not gonna have something that hurts you!"Remus snorted, folding his arms. "First of all, you all have sickles. And second of all... what, you're going to get rid of your broom?"James looked down at the case then back up. "Yeah.""James, don't be absurd—""I'm not being absurd! I'll get rid of it—""Merlin, a broom isn't something you can just replace—""It sure can be and don't tell me what to do with my own possessions—""If you're going to throw away a perfectly good broom merely because I have an—an allergy—""It's more than an allergy, it hurts you, and I'm not gonna throw it away! I'll have my dad sell it, or donate it—""This is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever—""Don't call me ridiculous!""I'm not calling you ridiculous, I'm calling the situation ridiculous which it absolutely is!"They both stopped and just stood there, staring at each other, both breathing heavily; Sirius and Peter were watching with big eyes, Sirius having been swiveling his head back and forth between them as they argued."Where's the popcorn when you need it," Peter murmured as he dropped the last of the reeds in.James made a disgusted sound and moved away from Remus. "It's my broom, I can do what I want with it.""Fine," Remus sniffled, "waste—" he stopped, unsure how much brooms cost. A lot. "—loads of galleons," he settled on and went over, picking up his satchel, intending to leave but realizing there was a pit he wouldn't be able to cross without the broom. Unless he jumped. Did he dare jump? It'd be so weird. He'd heal up any issues but... it was weird.He gave another sniffle then sat down against the wall, pulling a book out and angrily opening it onto his lap. James crouched next to the potion to work on it, muttering under his breath. Remus's skin prickled with irritation. He knew perfectly well it was James's choice, it was his broom! If he wanted to sell it or donate it or chuck it into the lake it was his decision, but Remus hated the fact James was going to do it because of him, and waste all that money! Even if he sold it they wouldn't get near the same amount of money back, so what was the point?Remus read until it was time to go then of course there was the matter of getting across the pit. James asked if they should go nick a school broom and Remus promised he could sit on the Starshooter. He pointed at the handle, indicating where he had positioned himself each time to make sure no silver touched him. James finally mounted the broom and Remus got on behind him, being very careful. They flew over the pit and Remus did his awkward hop off, swinging his leg to avoid the metal."See?" he asked, probably haughtier than he should have.James just frowned and went to get the others. Remus could feel the tension between him and James as they headed back to the dorms, and just clutched helplessly at his satchel, hating himself for causing more problems. Shouldn't have said anything, he thought miserably, not really paying attention as he walked. Should have just pretended it was my clumsiness.Suddenly he was jerked to the side and looked up to see Sirius had just saved him from walking right into a wall, his fingers still clutching the back of Remus's jumper. He just flashed Remus a smile, and let go.Remus ducked his head, trying to pay more attention as they walked. Sirius and Peter were the only ones talking, chattering to fill the uncomfortable silence from the other two Marauders. Neither of them said a word until they reached their dorm. James shoved his carrying case under his bed then turned around to face Remus."I am not going to have something that hurts my friend."Remus stiffened. "You have sickles.""You don't use the sickles, but you use the broom."Remus opened his mouth to continue arguing then quickly shut it. "S'your broom, do what you want," he finally muttered, turning on his heels. "I'll be in the library."He left, knowing he was being rude and probably petty, but it felt like a constriction in his chest... thinking about how James could just... get a new broom. New, expensive broom. Two new, expensive brooms in less than a year! Whereas Remus had to wear ratty jeans and secondhand robes and hoped that asking for a nice notebook for Christmas wasn't too much.He shook his head, trying to get rid of the jealousy flaring up; he was unable to, and hated himself all the more for it. It was as sickening as when he felt jealousy over Sirius being a natural Occlumens. He was happy James had so much money and could afford what he wanted, yet at the same time he couldn't help but wish he had even a little bit of it. And worse—it was his fault. His fault that his family was so poor.Remus cupped his hand over his left arm, over his bite mark. He could vaguely feel the ridges and bumps through the jumper. All my fault, he thought miserably.Course, the Lupins would never be anywhere near as rich as the Potters, but they certainly wouldn't be in this position if Lyall had been able to continue to work at the Ministry. Remus would probably be able to get a new uniform that actually fit him, and trainers that weren't about to fall to pieces. Trainers that he didn't have to constantly use the repairing spell on while praying they stayed together for another week or two.When he got to the library instead of studying he went under a table. There he wrapped his arms around his legs and rested his head down in them while guilt and self-hate gnawed away at his soul.

After an evening of quiet glares and silence, James and Remus made up in the morning. Remus woke up feeling far too awful and apologized, which James accepted with a big hug. Remus still felt uncomfortable about the fact James was going to try to get a whole new broom because of the silver thing, but he began to doubt it would work; surely Mr. Potter wouldn't agree to buy James a new broom for no reason? Since James couldn't explain why? That thought made him feel a lot better, and he was able to move on, though a few feelings of guilt over his own family's financial situation clung to the edges.Over the next couple days Remus spent a lot of his time studying, holing up in the library every free period and during some of the meals. He usually skipped lunch and munched on a sandwich or apple that his friends brought him on the way to their classes. The other boys expressed concern he was doing too much for exams that didn't 'mean' much but he pointed out the rest of his study group was taking it as seriously as him. They were meeting up every night that week, and extending the sessions."Yeah, a bunch of nerds agree you should overdo it with the studying, what a surprise," Sirius muttered."You know all this already, you don't need to stress out about it," added Peter. "You get good grades—""Because I study," he argued."Because you're a genius," James said, smacking Remus on the back. "You could probably ace everything even without studying anything."He shook his head, disagreeing wholeheartedly with that statement. "Remember what I said last year?" he asked to three very blank faces. "Even if you're good at Quidditch you still go to practice. And I'm not a genius."That night Fawley voiced her agreement with the other Marauders after seeing some of his memories, saying he needed to make sure he didn't overdo it. He promised he wasn't overdoing it—because really, he wasn't—but just because these exams weren't 'that' important didn't mean he should slack. He knew he was pretty smart but James was very wrong; he wasn't anywhere near a genius and knew if he didn't study his grades would be bad. At least, that's what he figured. He certainly wasn't going to test it.Fawley also saw the argument he had had with James and admitted she was a little surprised that James seemed so anxious about his broom since she knew how important it was to him. That he was so concerned over his friend he was considering getting rid of one of his most beloved possessions.Then, just as it was close to the lesson ending and he thought he'd escape..."You're not bloody allergic, you've got a crush!" All of their conversation in the nook, his denial, his running away, him going to Pomfrey. They were wrenched from his head before it got any further thankfully, before he started muttering to himself though he couldn't remember offhand what he had said. Had he mentioned Sirius?Fawley tucked some hair behind her ear while he cringed back, no idea what he could say about this, how to explain it. "Remus?" she asked gently."Wh—wh—what?" he mumbled, tugging at his sleeve, glancing at the door, wondering what she'd do if he just ran away.She shifted slightly, hands folding in her lap, shoulders straight back. "If there's anything you'd like to talk about... I'm here for you.""Th... thank you, Miss Fawley, I r-really appreciate that."There was an uncomfortable, awkward silence that hung in the air for several long seconds."As your Occlumency teacher... there is... a lot of your life that I am, unfortunately, privy to until you can fight me off," she finally continued, and he wanted to throw up. "I've made it clear I'm not going to tell your secrets—""Idonthaveacrushonanyone!" he blurted out.She raised her eyebrows. "All right—""I don't."Fawley slowly nodded. "I understand. I'm just... letting you know. We're going to start getting into probably uncomfortable territory now that you're getting older and... changing.""I'm not changing!" he squeaked, pushing himself farther into the couch. "It's fine. I'm fine."She held up a hand. "Remus, you are. You're... getting older now. Things change. I do try to be careful and only skim lightly... I try not to go too... deep... but that never... I can control where I go in your memories however there's no way for me to know if the memory I am seeing is about to become... extremely private or not. So I'm going to, at some point, intrude onto very... personal... memories. I believe it's best if we set some boundaries right now," she said.Remus stared at her in horror wondering if she was referring to what he thought she was referring to. Then he nearly threw up as she confirmed that yes, she was talking about that."If I see any memories of you alone in your dorm I'll do as I do when I accidentally snag a memory of you in the shower or changing: I'll exit out. Likewise with anything else that seems... on a... a similar path of... er, having... fun... by yourself."He covered his face and curled away from her, wanting to say he didn't do that! But even saying that seemed too... awful! "M—Miss F-Fawley I—I d-d-don't—I—""It's all right, Remus."It wasn't all right though! It was hideously embarrassing and he wanted to crawl into a hole and die. He couldn't bear to be in the same room as her anymore and he jumped to his feet. "I have to go—""Remus—""G-g-g-goodbye!""Remus!" she snapped as he made a dash for the door. "Wait one second please!" He hesitated, hand on the doorknob, face burning with shame. "Are we meeting next Tuesday? During the exams?"No, he never wanted to see her again!"Y-yes," he whispered.She was quiet for a moment then nodded. "All right. I'll see you next week then. And please don't be ashamed. It's perfectly natur—"He ran outside and slammed the door shut, feeling like he might self combust with how hotly mortified he was! Even though he had planned on going to the library after Occlumency he couldn't, he couldn't! Instead he ran and ran, as fast as he could towards the Gryffindor tower, dodging down side corridors, forcing himself to slow down only when he heard others nearby. He ran through the common room and up to his dorm, glad the other Marauders would be at James's practice. He slammed the dorm door behind him, grabbed some stuff from his bed, and dove underneath to press his face into the cool pillow and try not to cry, scream, or both.Was the entirety of his autumn term of second year existing solely to torture him?!/\/\/\/\/\Remus used the excuse of studying to avoid his friends as much as possible until Charms the next day. He especially didn't want to see Lily, who assumed wrongly he had a crush on someone. He knew the Christmas holidays wouldn't really be a big erasing spell but he was still looking forward to the time away, and hoped it would give him the chance to clear his head, especially after the horrifying interaction with Fawley. He kept hearing her repeat over and over in his head the things she said. The thing she was trying to say. It was... natural.Remus's leg jiggled under his desk and he was trying not to tap his quill on the parchment. Even if it was natural, there was no way he'd ever in a millions attempt to—to do that now. Not with someone who could see his memories, even if she would leave if it 'seemed like' it was 'heading' that way. He tried not to groan, feeling himself getting hotter and more embarrassed just thinking about it."Good morning class," Flitwick said, clapping his hands for attention and dragging Remus out of his contemplation on the best way to disappear for the rest of eternity. "Today we'll begin to work on the tickling charm.""Yes," Sirius hissed out, pumping his fist, while James and Peter both sat up a bit straighter. This was what they had been looking forward to. They were supposed to have started it a week or two ago but some of the classes had gotten a little out of hand and some spells had taken longer. But finally they were here.Flitwick began pairing everyone up. Poor Peter got paired up with Spinnet, though at least it was better than Sirius or James with Spinnet; Sirius got Inkwood and they both beamed at each other. Remus crossed his fingers under his desk but James got—"Are you kidding me?!" James cried out when Flitwick put him with Lily.Remus wound up with Magpie. The desks were stacked up against the wall to give everyone space to practice the spell on one another; Struthers, Colgate, and Nettle were the trio and took a corner to sorta form a triangle."Good luck," Magpie said, smiling shyly at Remus."Um, you t-too." Flitwick told everyone to begin, and Remus's side of the line got to go first. "Rictusempra!" He was the only student in his line that didn't have to check the blackboard for the proper motion. He had been practicing it by himself, and knew the motion down pat. Silver light shot out, slamming into Magpie who immediately began shrieking with laughter."NO! NO!" she squealed, collapsing onto her back, clutching at her middle, legs kicking."Nice panties, Magpie," Sirius said."SIRIUS BLACK YOU—AHAHAHAHA—PERVERT!" She tried to sit up, tugging her skirt down, but wriggled wildly, arms flailing. Remus quickly took the spell off and she gave him a grateful look, jumping to her feet, face brilliantly pink."Mr. Black—" Flitwick began."Sirius, you shouldn't look!" Inkwood said rather angrily, ignoring the teacher.Sirius grinned, shrugging. "Couldn't help it! Her legs were everywhere, it was kinda... you know... look here.""Mr. Black, that is—" Flitwick tried again but was once more interrupted."Locomotor trousers!" Lily's arm flourished and Sirius's trousers were yanked down, revealing dragon patterned boxers. Most of the class burst into laughter (the other three Marauders trying hard not to) while Sirius's face flooded with heat. He yanked his trousers back up, very horrified, very angry."ENOUGH!" Flitwick called out, snapping his wand and sending out a firecracker, startling everyone into silence. "Miss Evans! I cannot believe what I just witnessed!"Lily stuck her chin out. "He was teasing Athena.""I am well aware of what happened, I was about to step in," Flitwick said, furious. "Five points from Gryffindor for Mr. Black—you should not have done that—and ten points from you, Miss Evans. I am extremely disappointed. Minerva will be informed. Miss Magpie, are you all right? You seemed very... affected by the charm.""Lupin's spell felt very strong," Magpie explained, straightening out her skirt."Mr. Lupin, would you please use the spell on me?"Remus felt miserable at everyone watching him, wishing Magpie hadn't said that! Course there didn't seem to be any getting out of this. "Y—yes sir. Rictusempra!"Flitwick doubled over, wheezing loudly, falling to the floor, body quaking with laughter until Remus quickly took the spell off of him. "Wow!" He got up, plucking his fallen hat off the floor to put back onto his head. "Very impressive. Eight points to Gryffindor. It doesn't seem like you really need to practice this spell. Miss Nettle, will you pair up with Miss Magpie?""I—I don't mind being paired with Lupin," Magpie said, which surprised Remus since she was good friends with Nettle. He'd have thought she would jump at the chance."Be that as it may, it's clear Mr. Lupin doesn't need to practice." Flitwick waved his hand to indicate Nettle move over to join Magpie.Magpie looked discouraged, casting a strange look at Remus, but since Flitwick told him he could sit down and work on homework for a while he quickly scurried to a corner, and Magpie turned her gaze to Nettle. Remus got his books and parchment out, working on his Charms essay due on Friday, figuring he might as well specifically work on Charms in this class. He kept glancing up as his classmates giggled and laughed, and at James and Lily's constant arguing; Lily trying to correct James, James snapping at her. Though to his chagrin, James was the second one to really go down, though seemingly not as tickled as Magpie had been, only on his knees and not flat out on the floor. Sirius managed to get Inkwood though the most she did was double over. No one else ended up on the floor fully.Finally class ended and Flitwick didn't assign anymore homework since there was already an essay due Friday, and then the next week would be exams. Remus put everything in his bag and quickly left. He half-expected his friends to be interested in how well he could do the spell but the topic was definitely Revenge On Lily."How DARE she!" Sirius raged, storming ahead of the others. "She—and I—and my dragon boxers!" He whirled around suddenly, and James nearly ran into him. "My dragon boxers!""It's shit, mate," James agreed, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. "She had no right.""Just because you made a comment about Magpie's... p... panties..." Peter broke off giggling at that, "doesn't mean she shoulda done that. What color were they? I didn't see.""Yellow," Sirius replied, running his fingers through his hair."What's with girls and yellow underwear?" James asked, referring to Professor Dedenne's yellow bra and panties they had stolen the year before."Nah, it wasn't that dark, it was like... a pale yellow," Sirius explained.Remus pressed his lips thin, thinking it didn't seem right to be discussing Magpie's undergarments like that. "You really shouldn't have said anything about them."Sirius snorted. "Please. I couldn't help but see them. It's not like I purposely looked. She was right next to me and fell over and her legs were kicking and I just... saw.""But you still shouldn't have said anything," Remus muttered, hunching over."I'm still going to get revenge. On Lily I mean."James clapped him on the back. "I'm with you.""Me too," added Peter.They all looked at Remus who threw his hands up. "Depending on what it is I may help. Or I may simply... not stop you.""Nothing bad," promised Sirius. "I'm thinking something to her dorm. That way she can't really properly blame me.""We should put slime in her underwear drawer," suggested James with a wicked grin. Sirius whooped in agreement. "Course, she likes slimy Snivellus so... she should be used to slime everywhere."Remus thought that that wouldn't be too bad a prank. It would just mean doing laundry, and a bit of cleaning. "Okay," he said which surprised his friends. At least all of this was a distraction from all the calamity. All the shameful thoughts swirling around his head from Fawley's accusations. "I'll help with that... although it might still be suspicious if you do the slime spell, perhaps we could do something else.""Like what?" Sirius asked."Er..." He racked his brain for something harmless. "Custard?" It still wasn't great but they could have gone down a much worse path, doing something to her physically, like itching-powder-sticky-solution, or something like that.Instead of going to supper they decided to get revenge on Lily. Since Remus had no idea of a spell that could conjure custard (though it seemed to be the sort of spell they should know) that meant James donning his invisibility cloak and sneaking into the kitchens to steal some of the dessert. Unfortunately, the house-elves were not preparing custard that night so he wound up nicking a bunch of custard mix and the four of them made a cauldron full of custard in the bathroom."Oof maybe a mistake making it here," Sirius grunted as he hauled the cauldron out of the bathroom."Nah we can manage," James said, getting his broom out. "Should one of you go wait in the common room to distract any of the girls or would that be suspicious?""Probably be suspicious, depending on who comes in," Remus admitted. "I could talk to Lily or even Colgate or Inkwood... but I can't imagine any reason to talk to anyone else. Although... I suppose Peter and I—at least I'm assuming I'm not coming with you?—could be in the common room and if any of the girls come in perhaps we could set off some sort of... noise? Alarm?""That isn't like you though," James said, still just standing there straddling his broom."I could wait in the common room," Sirius said. "Set off fireworks if any of the second year girls come in to give you warning.""Then..." James glanced at the other two. "Which one is coming with me?"Neither of them said anything. Remus didn't mind going but suspected James would choose Peter simply because of the silver on the broom."I—you know I'm no good at this sort of thing," Peter said, shuffling. "Plus Remus has better hearing than me."James shifted his gaze to Remus who shrugged. "I'll be fine."James's eyes lit up and he dismounted his broom. "What if I wrap a sheet around it?""James—"But James was yanking a sheet off his bed so he could wrap it around the handle of his broom. "Does this help?"Remus sighed, deciding not to argue. "Yeah, that'll be fine."He got on the broom behind James and Sirius nestled the cauldron of custard between them. It was extremely awkward and Remus immediately regretted doing this. He had to keep one arm wrapped around the cauldron and the other stretched out to cling to James; not having both arms around James made him nervous.He squeaked a little as James kicked off and, after Peter opened the window and Sirius flung the invisibility cloak over them, they flew out. Remus closed his eyes tightly, wanting to bury his face against James's back but couldn't."You okay?""F—fine," he gulped, trying not to shake. His legs dangled down with the ground so far under him, and he could vaguely feel the hot sensation of the silver through the sheet and his trousers. It was sleeting and windy, the cloak flapping wildly as they flew around the tower. It felt like it took an eternity."Alohomora," James said and then the broom rocked as he leaned over, opening the window. Remus tried not to vomit at the sensation. Then they flew through the window, and were in the girls' dorm.Remus staggered away, setting the cauldron on the floor, panting heavily. He doubled over, hands on his thighs. "Bloody hell.""You sure you're okay?" James asked anxiously."The f-flight, not the silver," he gasped out."Oh."Remus took in a few breaths and then straightened up, glancing around the room. There were only three beds, and instead of sharing large wardrobes each girl had their own smaller one. He knew which bed was Lily's even without the scent or the initialed trunk. He went over, blushing slightly to see a photo of the two of them together stuck up on the wall next to her bed."Is she your girlfriend?" James asked.Remus jumped, and spun around. "For the millionth time no! Now, let's hurry." He scampered to the door and leaned against it, knowing he'd be able to hear the fireworks no matter what but wanting to keep an ear out just in case.James went to the small wardrobe by Lily's bed and opened one of the drawers. "Eewwww," he drew out, nose crinkled. "Evans' undies." He picked up a pair of pink panties, letting them dangle between his fingers. "Want a souvenir?""We are not stealing anything!" Remus hissed out, trying not to go redder.James wriggled his hand, the panties flapping. "Maybe we should send them to Snivellus. He'd like 'em.""James!""Okay, okay." He dropped the panties back into the drawer then hefted the cauldron of custard up, tipping it over, laughing as it oozed into the drawer. "Oh Merlin's beard this is great! This is better than slime! You should see it!""Shhh, someone's walking by," Remus said, holding a finger up to his lip.James fell silent, eyes wide, mouth slightly open. Remus stiffened, putting a hand on the doorknob. He heard footsteps approaching... then walking past. Once he couldn't hear them anymore he relaxed and motioned for James to finish. He was glad he could be here for this because he had the feeling if it had been James and Sirius together they probably would have done a lot worse.James tried using the locomotion spell to get as much of the custard out but just as he was about to set the cauldron back down they both heard kabooms from the common room. They stared at each other."Hurry!"James shut the drawer and Remus ran over, taking the cauldron and getting on the broom behind James. This time he could just slip his arm through the handle and let the cauldron dangle while keeping both arms around James. James got the cloak around them as best as he could then they darted out the window."Don't forget to close it," Remus reminded him."Cincinnium!" James flicked his wand and the window's lock slid back into place.They flew back around the tower and into the boys' dorm, nearly crashing into James's bed. They put the cauldron under James's bed for cleaning later, put the cloak and broom away, then hurried down the stairs to find Sirius in deep conversation with Inkwood, while Lily and Colgate stood nearby looking bored.James gave Sirius a thumbs up and Sirius grinned at Inkwood. "Hey, I have to get going. I'll talk to you later." He winked at her (sending her into a fit of giggles) then the Marauders made their exit, managing to hold back the laughter until they got to the sixth floor where they all collapsed in a heap. Remus felt a little bad for helping prank Lily but it was harmless (and he knew if he hadn't helped it probably would have ended up not so harmless), and a lot of fun. He just hoped she wouldn't be too mad... or figure out who did it!

Remus heard stomping. Angry stomping. He glanced up from his book, staring wide-eyed at the closed door. James, Sirius, and Peter were playing a board game on the floor, Spinnet was at his desk, and Struthers was on his own bed doing homework. It was rather late.But Remus knew those stomps. He shrank back against his headboard and waited.The door flung open so hard it slammed into the wall. Everyone else jumped in surprised then began protesting at the sight of Lily Evans standing there, fury etched across her face, one hand lifted in the air covered in custard."JAMES—POTTER—SIRIUS—BLACK!""What the heck, Evans, this is the boys' dorm!" James said, scrambling to grab his night robe, covering himself even though he was fully dressed in his pajamas."Evans, you're not supposed to be in here—" Spinnet began.Lily ignored him and marched over, brandishing her custard hand at James. "I KNOW PERFECTLY WELL YOU DID THIS!"James recoiled back, rearranging his face into a look of pure innocence. "Is that poop?"Her face reddened. "YOU KNOW DAMN WELL IT'S CHOCOLATE!""Why d'you have chocolate all over your hand?""IT'S CUSTARD!"James adjusted his glasses and put on a sweet smile. "Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that's how you're supposed to eat custard."She gave a screech of rage and started to go for her wand but as it was her right hand covered in custard she stopped right before reaching into her pocket. "You're going to get it!" She grabbed a pillow off the nearest bed and began trying to hit James. Not successfully since A, she was using her left hand and she was right handed, and B, James scrambled away and managed to duck away as she chased him"I don't understand, where did the custard come from?" Sirius asked. "Why are you blaming James?"Spinnet pushed his chair back, getting to his feet. "I should get a prefect.""You sit back down right this second, Spinnet!" Lily snarled out, ending her chase. Spinnet stared in fear then slowly sank back down, not saying anything else. "I don't know how you got into my dorm without setting off the alarms but I know you did it!" She flung the pillow at James and it smacked his midriff.James folded his arms. "If I could sneak in your dorm, I'd do something a little more fun than just put custard on your bed."Remus covered his lower mouth with his book, trying not to smile. He was worried for a second that James was going to say 'put custard in your drawer' which of course would have given it away. He was impressed James thought that through.James's statement did make Lily hesitate. "Of course it was you. Who else would put custard in my stuff? It's for what I did to Black today! I know it was.""I don't know who did it, but it wasn't me," James lied smoothly.Lily turned to glare at Sirius. "You, then.""Nope," Sirius replied. Lily waited, but he didn't say anything else."Well, I'm telling McGonagall tomorrow and you'll be in trouble," she said though she had considerably less anger in her voice now, probably realizing how 'impossible' it was for a boy to get to the girls' side.Remus bit his tongue, hating doing this. He wanted to tell her... but also didn't want to snitch on his friends. Besides, he'd get in trouble too. Still, lying to her like this, shifting the blame to another girl wasn't the greatest thing to do... however, it wasn't really fair girls could go into the boys' dorms so freely. Lily had done so a few times and once to prank James and Sirius so...Lily turned and stormed out."Did you do it?" Struthers asked as soon as the door shut."How could we get into the girls' dorms?" James asked with a shrug.Remus stayed up late, studying and also questioning himself over whether it was wrong or not. He struggled with the thought for a long time before finally falling asleep, books still open around him which he knocked off his bed in the morning when he jerked awake. He sleepily gathered all his books and then almost went down to breakfast in his pajamas after slipping his school robes over them but Sirius stopped him, turning him around and giving him a gentle push back to the dorm. He got dressed in a cleanish uniform (the shirt was rumpled and had been worn twice but oh well) and hurried after his friends.Post came, including a letter from his mother. Remus yawned, opening it up, sleepily reading about how excited she was for the holidays, and also her talking about the knitting group she had joined the month before. She had mentioned it in September and he had written back, encouraging her to go. It was a Muggle group in a nearby town and Lyall hadn't really liked the idea since the Lupins needed to be as private as possible. But Remus pointed out that if they were Muggle there wasn't much chance of them somehow guessing her son was a werewolf. After a lot of back and forth she had gone to a get together and enjoyed it.It's really nice chatting to other women. It's been so long since I've had someone else to talk to besides you or Lyall.Remus smiled, and wondered if this meant maybe they'd be okay with him having friends too! Then—"YES!" Sirius shrieked and Remus jumped. He grinned, lowering the letter he had gotten. "Oops, didn't mean to shout, but guess what?!" He didn't even wait for anyone to guess. "I'm going to be a—er, well, I guess I'm already a cousin and I'm not really going to be an uncle, technically, but—but Andy—Andromeda's pregnant!""Oh wow!""That's so neat!""Congratulations!"The other Marauders all gave Sirius thumbs up and arm pats while he beamed down at the letter. "She's due in June. Ha! That's so great!" He glanced over at the Slytherin table, at a group of girls. "I wonder if anyone else in the family knows," he muttered quietly, mostly to himself. "I don't... think she's in contact with anyone else." He ran his thumb along the letter, looking rather sad. Remus remembered the letter Sirius had sent during the summer of Andromeda being removed from the family. The Blacks had been so angry she married a Muggleborn, he wondered what they'd say or do if they knew she was having a baby with one."That's great she trusts you so much," James said.Sirius smiled and didn't say anything else, but seemed a little sad for the rest of the day./\/\/\/\/\James and Sirius were called into McGonagall's office before supper, and they emerged rather annoyed that McGonagall had questioned them about the custard thing and been 'far too suspicious', in James's words. However they hadn't gotten into trouble. At least nearly getting in trouble cheered Sirius up.That evening was a very, very cold Quidditch practice. It started out sleeting with a hard wind then wound up snowing. It was dark out, and Sirius, Peter, and Remus huddled together under a blanket Peter had brought and Remus mostly waterproofed. He also set up a row of bluebell flames in front of them. None of them could even properly see the players so it was kinda silly for them to be out there, but they wanted to show James their support. This was going to be the last practice until January.Once they heard Bell blow the whistle and shout that practice was over, Remus got rid of the flames and they hurried down the bleachers, sliding in the slush built up on the stairs. At the bottom they waited for James but he wasn't alone; Seo-Yun Kim was with him, one of the Beaters. James seemed a little confused as to why she walked with him."Hey," she said, facing Sirius."Me?"Kim rolled her eyes, but smiled. "Yeah. Wanna take me to the dance?"Sirius seemed in absolute shock and, after several seconds, merely repeated, "Me?""Yes. I'm sick of boys harassing me and you're kinda cute plus it'll piss off all the assholes who won't leave me alone that I'm taking a thirteen-year-old. It's nothing... romantic. Period. Okay? Just as, you know, friends I guess. I mean, we're not really friends but you know what I mean. Soooo... wanna go?"Sirius opened and closed his mouth a few times then nodded. "Yeah. Yeah!" Then he slipped back into his usual smooth voice. "Of course. I mean, as long as that's all it is.""Trust me. You're cute but... not my type," she said. "I'll be wearing mostly black so I don't think it matters what you wear. Thanks!" She spun on her heels and disappeared into the darkness in the general direction of the castle.Sirius just remained standing while James began shrieking and jumping around before flinging his arms around Sirius. "You got a bloody date! Siiirrriuusss!""Holy hippogriff!" Peter giggled. "That's amazing! That's incredible!""Wow, congratulations for the second time today," Remus laughed."I—I got a date," he whispered. "I'm going to the dance. Merlin's beard.""Come on, it's getting super cold," Peter said and began walking. James and Remus started too then turned around since Sirius wasn't moving. James rolled his eyes and grabbed Sirius's hand, yanking him along."You're only going to the dance if you don't freeze to death first.""Yeah. Absolutely," Sirius said, obviously not hearing what James was saying."You're turning into me," Remus teased and Sirius had enough presence of mind to stick his tongue out.They got up to the dorm room and crowded around the heater, peeling off their wet layers, warming up a bit; James went to get another shower while Sirius just sat on the floor with a stupid grin on his face."I need to let my parents know I'll be back on the 17th and not the six—oh!" He finally looked up. "You guys gotta stay too. And James. Please?""Of course!" Peter replied immediately. "I'm sure my parents will be okay with it, and my grandpa's not leaving for the skiing trip till the 18th."Remus shifted a bit, plucking at a hole in his jeans. "I... doubt I'll be able to," he said and Sirius frowned. "You know I can't tell them why I need to stay.""Surely you can think of something," Sirius pleaded, grabbing Remus's hand tightly. "I need all of you there! A date...""It's not a real date—""No, but it's still—I'll be the only second year going probably—I mean we all knew I'd get a date—and I just... I want you guys there.""Naturally," James said, coming back into the dorm, nothing but a towel haphazardly around his waist as he used another to half-dry his hair. "I'll write my parents tomorrow, let'em know."Sirius stared wide-eyed at Remus, still holding his hand which was making the box wriggle and threaten to come off. He fought hard to keep it pushed firmly down, resisting the urge to yank his hand away. "I... I'll try. No promises though."How was he supposed to convince his parents? What on earth could he possibly say?!/\/\/\/\/\Dear Mum and Dad, 8/12/72I wasn't expecting to send another letter your way and that's why I am using a school owl instead of Arthur. I didn't want him overdoing it. Anyway, some of the teachers have been assigning some... I don't want to say 'difficult' essays for the Christmas holidays, but some homework I would really like to do a lot of research for. I didn't think anything of it until last night and then I got an idea. There is a stupid dance on Saturday night (the 16th, the day we're supposed to be leaving). For everyone who stays over but wants to go home there is another train leaving on the seventeenth. I was thinking if it is okay with you, could I possibly come home on the seventeenth? That way I have an extra day to do a lot of research in the library without it disrupting my exams. I can't bring books home from the Hogwarts library so that's why I was thinking I could stay, to take a lot of notes and work on the assignments over the holiday break. Then when I come back I can finish adjusting them then.I know it's a lot to ask, and I'll understand if you don't want to do this. I was just hoping I could.Love, RemusHe read the letter over carefully, chewing at his bottom lip so hard he tasted blood. Did it sound believable enough? He handed it over to his friends, feeling a strange, floaty-swimmy feeling over the fact he could share something like this with them."Yeah, that sounds like you," Sirius laughed, handing the letter to Peter. "Staying over to study.""It isn't... completely wrong," Remus muttered, tugging at his sleeve. "I will be using some of the time to study.""I dunno about your parents but I'd believe this," Peter said.James quickly read through and then gave it back to Remus. "Same. Though maybe take out the bit about understanding if they don't want to do that. Gives them too much of an out.""I wanted to sound... nice."Sirius took Remus's quill and scratched the last sentence out. "Leave it out," he said.Remus looked at Peter who shrugged. "Don't ask me. I thought it seemed fine."Remus took out a fresh piece of parchment and copied over the rest of the letter so there wasn't a big slash at the bottom making them suspicious.PS, he added, I can't wait to see you!Though he wasn't sure how much he felt it. He was anxious to see them of course, but also just flat out terrified. What if they somehow guessed as soon as they saw him? At least he wouldn't have to worry about James or Peter accidentally giving it away on the platform, or having to hide. Unless Lily tried to come over... course, he was pretty sure she was going home on the sixteenth which meant if he stayed till the seventeenth he wouldn't need to worry about that. Another plus.In Potions they worked on a potion that would be part of their exams. It was a two part potion that needed a full week to finish brewing, and then more stuff added to it. Slughorn had them pair up and Remus wound up with Aegis again, since Inkwood dove for Sirius practically before Slughorn finished telling them to find a partner. Sirius glanced at Remus who shrugged. James offered to be his partner but he saw Aegis sitting alone, waiting to be with whoever was left over, and Remus shook his head."I'm fine with Aegis," he said and took his stuff over."Not able to partner with your friends again?" Aegis asked, sitting up straight."I am, if you don't mind my disastrous inability at making a decent potion," Remus said.Aegis frowned, processing what Remus said, then went faintly pink as he realized. He started to say something then stopped, smiling and moving to make room. "That means we will need to be partners again next week...""I know," Remus replied, taking his book out. "Again, only if you don't mind. I know this grade is important...""I don't mind... I usually just partner up with whoever is left," he admitted.Remus pressed his lips thin, wanting again to ask if he had any Slytherin friends but at the same time didn't want to pry. Soon they were working on the potion. Remus did his best with the ingredients, not daring to touch the potion; he hoped Aegis would be able to do that part of it well enough to give them an okay grade. He hated to put so much pressure on his partner but Aegis didn't really seem to mind too much."You're helping with the ingredients and double checking what I am doing," Aegis said as he poured dried something into the liquid. "That's very helpful."Remus watched the liquid turn to a pale grey color, and wrinkled his nose as a heavy sort of musky scent wafted up into his face. He covered his nose and mouth, trying not to gag. "Stinks so bad."Aegis sniffed. "Yeah, a bit..."Soon, the whole room smelled like that and it was all Remus could do to keep himself from throwing up. After a few more ingredients the smell sort of shifted into a woodsy sort of scent. It still had some musk to it but it wasn't quite as bad, and Remus could breathe again."Do you have any interesting Christmas plans?" Aegis asked, sitting down to wait, since now they were supposed to let it simmer for ten minutes."Not... really. We—we don't do much. What about you?""Nothing too much either. Uncle Minos usually needs to work. Pan and I usually decorate the house though. That's always fun.""We do a little," Remus said with a nod, though they didn't have many decorations. Most of them were pretty old and handmade. Not that there was anything wrong with that... he just sometimes wished they could do more like he saw other houses sometimes.They finished working on their potion then Slughorn had everyone move their cauldrons to the other room. It was a smaller room, full of tables where potions could be set till next time; either bubbling or simmering or hardly heated at all. Aegis and Remus got their cauldron onto a small fire and propped a card up with their names on it."...do something to Pratty and Pokey's potion before the finals..."Remus jerked a little, head snapping round. Mulciber and Avery were off in a corner, whispering and snickering to themselves. They were being quiet enough that nobody should have heard them. Nobody with human ears, that is.Remus started to go forward then stopped. What was he going to say? Tell them he knew what they planned? Should he go to Slughorn? Or should he tell James and Peter and see what they wanted to do? He looked over where James and Peter were beaming over their cauldron. The potion looked pretty much identical to Lily and Snape's potion so he knew it was extremely well done. They were going to probably get Os for it. And Peter deserved the O! Of course, James did too, but Peter definitely.Anger began filling Remus's body. No. They were not going to get away with it."You all right?""Huh?" He blinked a few times, turning back to Aegis. "Yes. Sorry, I was... distracted."Aegis was studying his face, his own etched with concern. "Did... something happen?""No. I—it's nothing. Ours looks pretty good, doesn't it?""Yes! It's... a few shades off but perhaps we can fix it next Friday."Everyone shuffled back into the main room to wash their hands and gather up their stuff. Remus saw Mulciber and Avery elbowing each other and Avery kept shooting smug looks towards James.Remus clenched his teeth, fighting the wolf back as it began stirring. It wasn't as strong as it was sometimes but he could feel it was quite irritated. It was... a little nice that it was mad on James and Peter's behalf.All the students left, hurrying out into the cold dungeon corridors, a nice break from the Potions classroom which had been getting hot from all the fires. James yawned, stretching his arms, wishing they had a break before Charms. Remus just watched him, wondering if he should say something now or later. If he said it now then James would seethe all through Charms which didn't seem like a good thing... so perhaps... later./\/\/\/\/\"WHAT?!"It was after Charms and Remus told them quietly what he had overheard. James's screech caused Remus to shrink back and his eardrums to hurt a bit."I th-think they;'re going to try to sabotage your potion," he whispered."Oh. OHHHH-hohohoho no I don't think so!" James sounded even wilder than Remus anticipated."Our potion is so good!" Peter said."It's perfect," James said, narrowing his eyes. "Completely perfect. If they're—oh that's so dumb!""What should we do?" Peter asked."I wasn't sure whether to tell Slughorn or not," Remus explained.James shook his head. "He probably wouldn't do anything about it. He'd probably just say 'you can't break into the back room'."Everyone knew there were a lot of spells placed on that door, much like the storeroom and Slughorn's personal cupboard."Maybe they'll be sprayed with that green stuff like we were," Sirius said, laughing quietly; James and Remus both grinned at the memory."Do you... think they'd be able to break in?" Peter asked, shifting from foot to foot. "What if they... like... you know... what if they convince Slughorn to let them go in for some reason?""Then he'd know they did it," Sirius said."No, but, if they did something to mess up the potion without it looking like it was, um, sabotaged...?" Peter trailed off with a helpless shrug.James frowned. "That's true. Okay no, we do need to do something.""What if we mess up theirs?" Sirius asked. "What if we go back in and switch them out, then last minute switch them again, so they sabotage their own potion!"James's eyes lit up but Remus said, "I don't know if we'd be able to do that. We don't even know if they're going to be able to do that. Perhaps we should just tell Professor Slughorn—""Right," James said, rolling his eyes, "'Hey Head of Slytherin some Slytherins are gonna do Slytherin-y things to our potion'. Yeah, that works.""Yeah, I like Sirius's idea," Peter said."Me too," agreed James.Remus tried not to sigh too loudly, it was such a stupid idea! "It is your decision. If you feel like you can, in fact, break into that heavily spelled room... twice... on the off chance that they'd be able to do the same... which does, in fact, risk your own potion..."Peter gaped loudly then clamped a hand over his mouth. "I forgot my gloves in the room.""PERFECT!" James shouted."What?""Perfect excuse to get in the first time, right now," James said."Wha...? No, I—I did forget my gloves—""Professor Slughorn will probably just get them for you himself," Remus said."Maybe, maybe not, it's worth a try," James said."He won't believe it twice.""I forget stuff all the time," Peter pointed out."Yeah but we don't know when Mulciber and Avery are going to try to wreck the potion," Sirius said, pushing his hair back. "So we should wait till probably Thursday evening to switch them back. If we get them switched in the first place.""Eh, we could always just break in and switch ours with Snape's," snickered James."No!" Remus said, and they gave him startled looks. "No, he was partnered with Lily and I won't allow her grades to be affected like that."Sirius made a face. "Fine.""Right so, we go find Slughorn now, try to get into the back room to switch our potion with Mulciber and Avery's potion, right?" James asked, and Peter and Sirius nodded.They checked the Great Hall and after seeing Slughorn wasn't there they hurried down to the entrance hall to wait. Soon Slughorn came out from the stairwell leading to the dungeon and they ran over, James explaining what happened. Slughorn nodded, agreeing to go back down to fetch them."Yes," Sirius hissed softly.The four of them followed Slughorn down to the dungeon though Remus had no idea how they were going to switch the potions with Slughorn right there until just outside the classroom when James whispered right into Remus's ear to please distract him. Distract Slughorn. Great. Why him?They went into the classroom and Slughorn unlocked the door. "Hey, um, P-Professor?" Remus asked just as he opened the door."Yes?"James, Peter, and Sirius slid into the back room, leaving Remus trying to figure out what to say. He considered asking about his potion being off color but then suspected Slughorn might want to go in and see for himself. "It's about—about the exams next week.""Yes?""Are... are we... just doing um... the written exams on Monday... right? And the practical part on Friday?"Slughorn looked down at him. "Yes, that's right. I went over that this morning, Mr. Lupin.""Y—yes," he mumbled, feeling awkward. "I forgot to write it down and then couldn't remember.""You know, your theoretical potion work is quite accomplished," Slughorn said, rocking back and forth a bit. Beyond him Remus could hear the others whispering about switching things. "I've said that before. I don't quite understand why you have so much trouble making potions...""My... my nose, sir," he whispered, trying not to look through the door."Ah, that's right, you said it's sensitive...""Yes. The ingredients bother me..." He heard a slight gasp and a snicker. What was going on?!"I imagine that does provide an issue when working," Slughorn said then he frowned, turning his head. "They're taking a long time...""S—sir!" Remus said and Slughorn looked back at him. He tried to think of something to say. Something about the Christmas party? He had been invited but never responded and thankfully Slughorn hadn't bothered him about it yet. "I—I—I... I w-wanted t—"He was saved by the other three tumbling into view. "Found them!" James said, holding up Peter's gloves triumphantly. "One had fallen under a table and we had a heckuva time finding it.""Th—thank you, Professor Slughorn!" Peter said brightly.They hurried past, Sirius grabbing Remus to pull him along. Slughorn watched them go with a puzzled look but shrugged and shut the door, locking it again. The Marauders dashed into the corridor and ran along until they went down a side one for some privacy, so James could inform Remus they had, in fact, done something different."Our cauldron was almost right next to theirs," James whispered, "so we just switched our cards. I'm going to just sneak in Friday morning to switch the cards back, since it's usually unlocked before classes start. I figure they're not gonna remember where theirs was exactly!"Remus tilted his head, a smile spreading on his face. "All right, now that is brilliant," he acknowledged, and James puffed his chest out, quite proud of himself.

Author's Note: I'm going to be going back (and have started) to edit some of the words to be the British terms. I know I use American terms too often and I am trying to fix that, and not everything will be perfect (like I guess it'd be more common to call it revising rather than studying but I am going to continue to use studying). But like, I'm gonna be changing cookies to biscuits, etc, etc. Also I am considering going back and editing book one and book two up to the point where I got my beta. I am not sure? Cause it is a lot of work? But if I do I'll let you know! I just feel my writing has improved since starting this story and maybe I should fix a few... not so well worded bits lol. We'll see./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\It was the last weekend before the exams and the others wanted to spend the whole time playing pranks, but Remus refused point blank. Instead, he hid himself away in the library to study. He read and read until the words swarmed in front of him, then he'd take a short walk to come back to reality, only to return immediately to reading. He skipped breakfast and would have skipped lunch but the Marauders showed up to harass him until he agreed to go to the Great Hall. He only ate a little, reading instead of eating; he was vaguely aware of the looks his friends were giving him, but not caring. After he finished eating he just returned to the library.After curfew, Remus and Lily spent quite a bit of time with Macdonald to help prepare her for the exams. They weren't too sure what Prewett might be doing, however they were able to at least guide her on what the other teachers did the previous year, reassuring her they weren't very hard."Then why is he freaking out so much?" Macdonald asked, shooting a look to Remus."He freaks out about everything, don't mind him," Lily replied, ignoring the scowl on his face.Remus and Lily stayed up pretty late. So did the Marauders but they were on the other side of the common room, jamming out to music while playing card games with some older students. Finally, at around twelve-thirty Lily yawned, stretched her arms, and decided to head to bed. Remus didn't go up to his dorm until nearly three, eyes drooping, feet shuffling. He climbed into bed and fell asleep fully dressed.He woke up sometime very early in the morning to the sound of the door creaking open and someone tiptoeing. He shifted around then sat up, head hurting from how little sleep he had gotten. Rubbing his forehead, he pushed back the curtains, expecting to see one of the boys and being absolutely shocked to see Lily.She froze when she saw him, a huge bowl in her arms. "Er," she said, in a very quiet but slightly strangled manner. "I can explain."His eyes darted to the bowl and saw what looked and smelled like banana custard. He looked back at her then over at James's bed before tipping his head, raising his eyebrows. Lily grinned and nodded. He grinned back and watched as she approached the drawers. He heard the drawer opening, a glooping sound as the custard went in, then the drawer closing.She tiptoed back out and gave him a thumbs up. He just shook his head and slid back under the covers, falling asleep almost instantly./\/\/\/\/\"WHAT—THE—BLOODY—HELL?!"Remus was jerked away a couple hours later, a bolt of fear shooting through his body before realizing it was James. He was shrieking with rage and yelling about custard and Lily. Remus slithered out of bed, squinting at the light. James stormed around, one hand dripping custard all over the floor. Everyone else was getting out of bed, having also been awoken by the screams since James was usually the first one awake."What happened?" Sirius asked, emerging from his own bed with his hair looking as though he had already brushed it whereas Remus's was sticking out everywhere and was in desperate need of untangling."EVANS!" James roared. "She—she—""Got revenge?" Spinnet asked, quite amused.James glared. "You do realize this means she's come into our dorm! Again! Honestly! I don't know why she'd do it, she doesn't—" he stopped realizing Spinnet and Struthers were right there, "—er, she knows we can't get into her dorm! I couldn't have done it.""Maybe it wasn't her," Peter said with a yawn, blinking sleepily. "Maybe someone else got the idea."James instantly turned to face Spinnet who shook his head. "Don't look at me. It's dumb and childish." James grunted and stormed off to go clean his hand off. As soon as he left Spinnet burst into laughter. "If any of you know who did do it, let me know cause that was great!"Remus considered going back to bed (and his aching head was wanting to do that too) but instead he got clean clothes to change into and went down to breakfast. James wanted more revenge against Lily, grumbling all through breakfast, then glowering once she came in."Hey—Red!" James snapped and Lily gave him a sneering sort of look. "You sneaking into our dorm now?"Her eyes briefly met Remus's before she flicked her gaze back to James. "I have no idea what you're talking about, Potter!" She stuck her nose in the air and whisked past them, sitting as far from them as she could."I know it was her..." James jammed his fork into his breakfast, going back to muttering."Come on, we've got exams," Remus said, not wanting to get into a pranking war during such an important week. "At least wait until after Christmas.""Mmmm..." James slowly began smiling. "Or... I could use Christmas.""Ooh, whatcha thinking of doing?" Sirius asked, perking up.James leaned in. "I'm thinking of sending her a Christmas present from Snivellus professing his undying love for her.""Yes!" said Sirius."That'd be hilarious!" snickered Peter."No!" Remus choked out. "That's cruel! Besides he's probably sending her a gift. She'd know immediately it wasn't from him.""I'll write something like 'I sent my other gift already but decided to confess' or somethin'," James said, waving his fork in victory."You don't know how he's giving her anything," Remus pointed out. "Even if he does perhaps they're not going to exchange presents until they get back to school—""Oh that reminds me!" Sirius said, cutting him off. "Do you want to do that?'"Do... what?" Remus asked, confused by the out-of-no-where question. He thought back to the last few things, trying to figure out what he meant. "Send... Lily... a love letter?""No!" Sirius laughed then stopped, narrowing his eyes. "Wait. Actually, do you want to do that?"Remus smacked the table in frustration. "No! No, no, and no again! How many times do I have to say—""Right, right, you're just friends," said James, rolling his eyes.Remus opened his mouth to snap at James but Sirius spoke first, voice going very soft so nobody else would hear them. "I meant, do you want to exchange presents when we come back here? That way... I mean, I know we're supposed to be a secret from your parents and that way you don't have to worry about getting owls. Actually... should... should we even be writing you... this holiday?" He sounded very sad at the idea of not being able to have contact with Remus.He was sad at the idea too. Two weeks without letters from his friends... "I... I'm not sure. Perhaps exchanging presents when we're back here would be best. As for the letters maybe..." If he couldn't figure something out for the Christmas holidays, what were they supposed to do for summer? "Well, if you send them only at night and make sure they're instructed to only give me the letters I might be able to." He had been talking quietly but now he dropped his voice even lower, all of them heaving to lean in close to hear him. "Although, I'm not going to be able to... see owls... on the nineteenth, twentieth, or twenty-first.""How come?" Pete asked.Remus stared. "It... I..." He poked at his eggs, feeling flushed."Furry little problem," James said smugly, answering for him."Stop calling it that! But... yes. That."Peter smacked his forehead. "Merlin I forgot again. I'm sorry. I mean, I didn't forget about—um—you know, that you're, uh, like that, but I didn't realize it was coming up.""S'fine..." He felt dizzy over the fact they were talking about in the Great Hall. They were being cryptic but it still made him extremely strange, and uncomfortable; his spine tingled and his stomach twisted. He wanted to run and hide...Sirius smacked Remus's back and he dropped his fork. "We'll do that. I'll make sure Fili knows to only give you the letter.""Do we even trust that owl to follow your orders?" James snorted."Oi!" Sirius flung a bit of toast at James; it missed and hit an older girl who glared down at them. "Fili... likes me. He'll listen to me.""I'm not sure if I'll be able to send a letter back," Remus said reluctantly. "I don't really want to use Arthur since he's getting so old, and Filibuster never lets me near him."Sirius's face fell a little. "Ah. Well, that's fine, if you can't.""Mmmph!" Peter said, his mouth full. He quickly chewed and swallowed his food so he could say, "You can use Cocoa! He likes you.""Is that... all right? If I use him to send a letter to Sirius too?" Remus asked.Peter nodded, smiling wide. "Uh-huh! It's fine!""Thank you..."Remus had almost forgotten what had even sparked the whole owl post conversation until James started talking about it again, figuring a nice box of chocolates would be a great gift. "Or I could just have it be anonymous... make her think some poor bloke's in love with her...""Please don't, it's really awful to toy with someone like that," said Remus."It's just for fun," Sirius snickered."It's not! It's extremely mean. It's not funny at all."James pushed around some sausage as he considered this. "I guess," he finally agreed. "All right, fine, I won't. But you need to come up with something then, if you're not gonna let me do that."Remus groaned. "I don't... oh, all right. It'll be after Christmas though. I need to study.""That's fine. After Christmas."Remus shoveled the rest of his food into his mouth then went to the library for some more studying. His head was aching pretty hard and he had an even harder time concentrating than the day before. He kept pressing his fingertips against his eyes, taking in slow, deep breaths. All he could think about was that in a week he'd be going home, or less than a week if his parents didn't agree to him having the extra day.Sirius would be fine going to the dance without me around, he thought, rubbing his forehead. James'll be there, and that'll be all right... right? He tapped his quill against the parchment, trying to ignore the bitter feeling towards Kim for going with Sirius. It was just as friends though. Kim didn't seem interested in Sirius at all, and they were a year and a half apart—though he supposed that didn't matter. He didn't think she was lying about going as 'just friends' (or not even that since they weren't really friends) however he couldn't help but feel...Jealous, he thought miserable, head dropping onto the table. He'd never ever, ever, ever be able to go to a dance with—Not that I want to, he thought quickly, before the image could form. I don't I don't! Just study, Remus. Words. Focus.He pushed the box firmly down then returned to his books, gritting his teeth and forcing himself to think of nothing but the words before him./\/\/\/\/\Lily was in a very giggly mood when she met up with Remus and the rest of the study group after supper. After they disbanded for curfew, Lily took Remus's hand and dragged him out of the library, wanting to know everything that happened. He told her in detail, and also did his best to ask, without causing suspicion... did Lily really think it was James who put custard in her drawer?"Oh, I don't know, probably not," she sighed, linking her arm with his. "I know you boys can't get into the girls' dorms. It baffles me though. It seems like such a Potter prank. Ooh, he put someone up to it, didn't he? One of the girls on the Quidditch team?"Remus shook his head. "As far as I know he's never asked anyone on the Quidditch team to do something like that.""Hmm. Well, at least Black didn't give me away."Remus froze. "What?""Black?" Lily gave him a look. "He woke up last night too, apparently. He told me earlier he knew I did it, he saw me. He told me he thought it was funny, and wouldn't tell Potter."Remus was rather surprised. Sirius hadn't said anything to him about it, though he had no idea Sirius even knew. At least he was keeping Lily's secret. Of course, since it was a harmless and funny prank he would.They stayed up a bit late together in the common room, heads together, going through what they learned the previous week. Again, Lily left early, and Remus stayed up quite late, shuffling through his notes, wishing he didn't have as much anxiety as he did. He knew perfectly well these weren't tough but every time he put his notes down his brain whispered, what if they are? What if you forget something? What if you didn't study quite enough? What if? so he'd pick the notes back up.The other students left the common room until it was just Remus, head pounding as he tried to reread some of his Astronomy stuff. His vision sort of swam a bit and he felt sleepier and sleepier until—"Remus?""YAAAH!" he yelped, arms flinging, body jerking back, hand smacking whoever had touched his shoulder.Sirius recoiled a bit, rubbing his arm where Remus had clipped him. "Ouch!""S—sorry! You startled me! I w-was reading and—""You were asleep," Sirius said, raising his eyebrows."No, I was—I was definitely studying," Remus argued."Remy, it's nearly three-thirty and we have class in five and a half hours," Sirius said, gently taking Remus's arm and pulling him up. "Stop fussing. You'll do fine. These are halfway pointless anyway." Remus gathered up his stuff, not saying anything. "You know they are. From last year. The only ones that really matter—properly, I mean—are the ones at the end of the year.""These affect our grades," Remus replied stiffly, books and parchment slipping out of his arms.Sirius took some of them from him to help carry. "A little, but it's dumb to be so worked up over them."Remus's chest tightened, and he hunched a bit. "S'not dumb," he muttered, anxiety flaring back up."It is though," Sirius said, not seeming to notice the annoyance and hurt hidden behind Remus's fringe. "You're smart. Very smart. Why are you so worried about all this?""We should get to bed," Remus said, and headed to the stairs.He didn't want to admit part of it was wanting to get the best grades possible, the very best. Yeah, 90% was passing pretty darn good, but—but getting 110%?! That proved something. That proved he wasn't like—like what people said. It probably didn't matter too much however he really wanted to have something to show he wasn't a dumb animal. Physical proof. A slew of Os (and an A or an E in Potions, of course) to hold onto whenever he read about how stupid and brainless werewolves were. And if for some reason he was ever out as a werewolf he'd have this, be able to say look I did this as a werewolf we're not STUPID! Course that'd never happen, but still.Plus... what if his grades determined whether or not his mother let him stay in school? She had called it a failed experiment, so... if he failed or didn't do as well as he had been doing, what if that made her decide he had to stay at home? What if it convinced his father?He wanted the absolute top, best, highest percentages he could possibly get, even with the exams that 'didn't matter'.They mattered to him though. Wasn't that enough?/\/\/\/\/\Remus was dead in the morning, sleeping through breakfast and waking up when James shook him. Peter helped peel bits of egg off Remus's face, as he had fallen asleep on his plate. They stopped by the bathroom on the way to Potions so Remus could make sure his face was clean enough.The first day of exams seemed to go well enough, and Remus stayed up late that night to do more studying. He was extremely wiped on Tuesday and trudged through the day, snatching bits of sleep, a bit relieved they only had two classes. He was going to go to the study group then remembered it was Tuesday and he was meeting up with Fawley. He had almost forgotten about it.He kinda wished he had.He headed to the fourth floor, remembering what had been said last time, hoping she wouldn't bring it up again, hoping she'd just pretend it never happened. Hoping she wouldn't see him reading Your Body at Hogwarts. Then again she made it clear if it was... him alone in the dorm she would... exit out of the memory so...He was already hot when he crept into the room, on edge, waiting. Fawley greeted him cheerfully, asking how he was doing how his exams were going, as if she hadn't said those things at the end of their last meeting. He mumbled he was all right, just kinda tired, anxious about the exams, hoping his parents would let him stay till the seventeenth."Sirius got asked to the dance," he explained when she appeared puzzled. "He wants us to stay that night for... er... moral support, I—I guess. I t-told them I wanted to study in the library.""Hopefully they'll believe you," she replied, and he was relieved she didn't seem too fussed about him staying for Sirius's sake. "You sound exhausted though. Are you getting enough sleep?""E—enough...""Hmm. Well, shall we begin?"She put her hands on his temples and the first memory that popped up was when Kim asked Sirius to the dance. Remus tried to fight Fawley off but was so mentally exhausted he couldn't even put up his normal thin barrier. They skimmed a few more memories then broke apart. Remus slumped down, clutching his head."You haven't gotten much sleep," she said, twisting her cane around."I've been studying," he reminded her."Yes, and I know how you can get. You need to sleep. And eat. Not getting enough of either will severely impact your grades, you know."He scowled, ducking his head. "Yes, I know."Then to his horror the next memory was him alone in the dorm which she immediately broke contact for. It had, of course, just been him studying, but the fact she broke away like memories of him naked made him feel embarrassed. He waited for her to say something... but all she did was put her hands back on his temple and go into another memory.At around 6:30 when they stopped for what was meant to be a short break, Fawley said, "I think we should end the lesson here.""We still have half an hour—""Remus, you're exhausted. I can hear it in your voice, and see it in your memories.""But—""No. No buts. I hate to cut this lesson short since we won't see each other for three weeks, but I cannot in good faith push you more right now." Remus wriggled uncomfortably, tugging at his sleeve, trying to come up with a good argument. "Go get some rest," she said gently."Miss Fawley—""I wish you luck in the rest of your exams but I know you're going to do well, and have a very Merry Christmas, all right?"Remus reluctantly agreed and then gave her a hug. "Have a good Christmas too, Miss Fawley."She touched his head lightly then let him go. Instead of going to his dorm, he turned the opposite way and headed back to the library./\/\/\/\/\"HUH?!"Remus jerked upright, a piece of parchment sticking to his cheek.Mr. Farrow was standing before him, glaring. "The library is closing, and that means it's past your curfew, boy," he said."Wh—what?!" Remus looked down at his notes then back up the librarian. "It c-can't be, n-n-n—""Get your stuff together and go." Then to his surprise and shock Farrow added quietly, "Before the prefect patrols the corridor outside again. You've got about five to ten minutes to avoid that."Remus quickly shoved everything into his bag, thanked Mr. Farrow ("Hrmph"), and skedaddled out of the library, feeling disoriented, not even remembering falling asleep. He took side corridors and secret passages to get back to his dorm, nearly running into a few prefects on the way but managing to stay out of their way. He fell through the entrance hole and was immediately swarmed on by his friends who were all quite surprised he had been out so late."You guys are out past curfew all the time," he reminded them as they went up the stairs."Yeah! We are, you aren't," James said."I—I fell asleep in the library..."Once on his bed he took out all his notes which didn't amount to much. He must have fallen asleep almost as soon as he started. He considered putting everything aside and just going to sleep early but the persistent fear of failing, what if you fail, you need to do the best you can do, what if you get a 99% and your mum decides that means you shouldn't stay!Turning down his friends' offer of a few rounds of Jarvey he just returned to studying./\/\/\/\/\Wednesday morning he was awoken by Peter. "Too early, class not for 'while," he murmured and rolled over."No but you got a letter."Remus sat up, blinking at an owl sitting on the windowsill, an envelope attached to its leg with his name on it. It was from his parents. A stab of fear shot through his core and he scrambled out of bed, lifting the window, shivering at the blast of cold air until he shut the window again, the envelope now in hand. He felt... very nervous."You all right?" Pete asked."Uh-huh. It's probably an answer to whether or not I can stay till Sunday..." He sat down on the edge of his bed, toying with the flap stuck firmly down. Finally he opened it, sliding the single sheet of paper out.Dear Remus 12/12/72I will be at Kings Cross station on Saturday the sixteenth. I expect you to come home on the train that day. I understand your need to study and appreciate your work ethic however you spend so much time at school now and so little time with us, we want you home. Don't you want to be home too? If you send a list of books needed, your father said he can go to a library to get them. You know, I never really thought about wizarding libraries. Are they common? We don't have one in Dragon's Field but it is a very small community. I'll have to ask your father tonight. In any case, see you Saturday darling.Love always, MumRemus sighed, letting the letter fall to the floor."I take it it's a no?" Pete asked.He shook his head miserably. "Where are they?""Breakfast," Pete replied. "I was gonna sleep in too but the pecking on the window woke me up.""I'm sorry.""Nah, it's fine. Actually, I dunno where they are now cause it's well past time for them to be done for breakfast. They left at like, seven.""Breakfast doesn't start till seven-thirty..." Remus glanced at the clock. Nine-thirty. Normally classes started at nine but on Wednesdays they didn't go to class till eleven. "They're probably getting up to mischief."Remus quickly got ready for the day, shoved everything he'd need in his satchel, and went down to the Great Hall with Peter; both felt a bit nervous since neither of them saw any sign of Sirius or James. They were still missing when they went to Charms and showed up five minutes late, losing five points each from Gryffindor."Where were you?" Pete asked after class ended and they were headed back to the Great Hall for lunch even though Remus wasn't very hungry.The two exchanged amused glances. "Hogsmeade," Sirius said."Wh—what? Why?" Remus asked, shocked they'd sneak in on a school morning! "You didn't have much time there—""Had some important stuff to get," James said."Plus I got a flower thing for Kim," Sirius added. "I think that's what you're supposed to do. Get them a flower thingie to put on their wrist or boobs.""Yeah, it is important," James said with a confident nod."Did you get one for her boobs?" Pete asked."Nah, for her wrist. Are you kidding? She's a bloody strong Beater and made it clear this is a zero romance thing," Sirius laughed. "I am not doing anything like that. I'm there for one thing only. Make other boys mad. She said so." He puffed out his chest and began running his fingers through his hair.Peter elbowed Remus and whispered, "You gonna tell him?""Tell me what?" Sirius asked and when Peter made a face he added, "You weren't very quiet with that there, Petey.""Ahhh..." Remus looked down at his shoes, feeling awkward now. "My—my mum wrote back. I have to go home Saturday. I... I c-can't stay. I'm sorry."Sirius deflated quite a bit. "Oh.""Yeah. Um. I—I am sorry, I'd stay—""Yeah, yeah, I know.""—if I could. I would."Sirius managed a smile. "I know. I appreciate the fact you even asked." He reached out and messed up Remus's hair.Remus ducked away, still feeling guilty, wishing his mum would trust him a little! Or rather, let go. He missed his parents and wanted to be with them, but... part of him kinda wanted to just stay in school for the entire holidays. The thought of seeing his parents again? Wonderful! The thought of being home with nothing much to do, very little ways to study or do homework, and having to be in that tiny cellar for the full moon? Not so wonderful. Plus disappointing Sirius? Also not so wonderful.He sighed and put food on his plate even though he wasn't very hungry and just sort of pushed it around, feeling very depressed and angry.

The fact that the Slug Club Christmas party, the Dance, and the Christmas holidays were just a couple days away seemed to distract pretty much everyone besides Remus. Even in the study group. Pierce and Lily kept talking about the dance even though they wouldn't be going. There was a rumor that the Hufflepuffskeins were going to be performing but that was, as far as Remus could tell, just a rumor.James and Peter both heard back from their parents; they'd be going home on the seventeenth. So would Lily. She wanted to stay to see the decorations and dresses, as well as try to sneak into the dance to see if the Hufflepuffskeins were really playing. Annnnd so would Aegis."Pan got invited to the dance," he explained on Thursday night, "and I don't want Uncle Minos and Aunt Ellie making two trips in."Remus realized he'd have nobody on the train with him on Saturday. He wondered if he'd literally be the only student going home that day, though figured there were probably going to be a couple others. There had to be. Even if there were, however, he'd still be sitting alone which felt kinda weird to him. The only time he had been alone on the Hogwarts Express was the first trip. Sure, he liked having time to himself but—but only when he chose to do so.Then it was Friday morning and James and Peter were especially anxious about getting to Potions class as quickly as possible. The Marauders ate their breakfast then hurried down but it was locked. They waited for Slughorn to appear who seemed surprised to see them."Just, looking forward to the test!" James said brightly."That's the spirit!" Slughorn chuckled as he opened the door.They piled in, and thankfully Sirius offered to be the distraction once Slughorn unlocked the back door, though Remus stayed near the front door in order to see if Mulciber and/or Avery showed up before James and Pete got the cards switched.Somehow—somehow—they pulled it off. James and Peter came out of the back room with smiles, Slughorn never noticed them, and the four of them were in their seats just as everyone else showed up, pictures of innocence. Slughorn praised James and Peter's perfect potion, and lamented over Mulciber and Avery who were absolutely livid.As soon as class was dismissed and they went into the hall, Mulciber grabbed James. "I know you did something!" he snarled.James looked at his hand then back up. "Did what? What did I do now?"Mulciber shook him. "You must have switched our potions!""What?" James laughed. "Right. I usually get Os in class and you usually get... what, As? Let's see. Slughorn was praising my potion and... oh, oh right, said yours wasn't that good. Gee, that sucks. But it's not my fault."Mulciber got his wand out, but older students were appearing to go to their Potions class and it was a sixth year class so there were prefects."You're going to get it!" Mulciber hissed out then fled with Avery, while James just laughed some more./\/\/\/\/\The rest of Friday went by quicker than any of them expected. They had a lot to do, what with getting their potion into the kitchens and into the food. It had finished up a couple days ago and they tested it, and it seemed to be working fine. James was a little anxious it was too similar to their Halloween prank, but it was too late now; they didn't have anything else."You know... we don't... need to prank the Great Hall," Remus said, an idea forming in his head."Right," James grumbled, eyeing him.Remus smiled. "There's something else we could do. Slughorn is having his party tonight."James's eyes slowly got wider and wider until they were unnaturally enormous and Remus wondered how he had managed such a feat. He grabbed Remus and hugged him tightly, spinning him around. "Genius!" he gasped out. "Positively a genius! I could kiss you!"A strange flustery feeling slammed into Remus so hard he could feel it all over. He felt dizzy, and disoriented, and didn't like it one bit; it felt too close to some of his recent thoughts, which was of course the only reason it made him feel weird. He didn't want to kiss James. He didn't want to kiss any boy. At all. Period. Ever."It starts at, um, eight, doesn't it?" Pete asked. "That's when it did last year.""Yeah, it's still at eight," James said. He had gotten an invitation as well as Remus, but hadn't wanted to go. He agreed it was all really boring and of no interest."So we sneak into the kitchens and put the potion in with the drinks?" Sirius asked, and the others nodded.Pranking the Slug Club was infinitely more interesting and fun than the Great Hall. Sure, there wouldn't be as many people but the setting made it perfect. It was just a shame none of them would be able to see it, though Remus knew he'd be hearing about it from Lily.During the end-of-term feast other students seemed suspicious of the food and of the Marauders; several students sent looks their way, especially when nothing happened."Next year though, we'll really get'em," James whispered."Yeah it kinda feels weird not to be doing anything," Peter said."But it's gonna be so fun getting the club!" James broke off into giggles.After they finished eating and Dumbledore made a small speech about the term ending and wishing a happy holiday for those leaving the next day, the Marauders headed back to their dorm to hang out until closer to the party. They played card games and sadly watched Remus pack a small bag."If I steal your bag that means you can't go, right?" Sirius teased."It's just two weeks," Remus said after he put his last book away. "It'll go by fast.""I hope so..." Sirius glanced towards the window, brow furrowing."Be sure to send me loads of pictures of you all dressed up for the dance," Remus said."OH!" Sirius jumped to his feet. "I can do you one better!" He ran to the wardrobe, rustled around, then ran out of the dorm. Moments later he came back in with a flourish. "TADA!"He was wearing a very nice long black suit jacket that buttoned tightly and flowed in the back, sort of a mix between a Muggle suit jacket and robes, and black trousers. Underneath the jacket was a dark red shirt, whose sleeves stuck out past the jacket's sleeves with sort of ruffles. Sirius did another twirl and then a pose."That looks amazing," Remus said, clapping. "The socks don't quite fit though."Sirius looked down at his red-and-gold socks, laughing. "The red top is James's. The sleeves are a bit short too but with the style…" he held his arm up, the ruffles flapping around, "it doesn't matter too much.""You look awesome!" Peter said."It suits you," James snickered.Sirius grinned at the pun then turned back to Remus. "You think I look all right?""I said you look amazing," Remus replied and Sirius seemed a bit awkward, face impasse, hands picking at invisible lint. Obviously he wanted more. "Fine. You're without a doubt the best looking boy in the entire school, girls will fawn over you, boys will hate you. Is that better?"Sirius just laughed again, grabbing at Remus, messing his hair up. Remus shouted in protest, managing to struggle free and dive behind Peter for safety."You'll wrinkle your outfit!" Remus pointed out, peering over Peter's shoulder.Sirius scowled. "Fine, you win this round, Lupin." He left the room and Remus flopped back.Thankfully when Sirius returned in his uniform he didn't try to go after Remus again. Instead they all gathered on Peter's bed to play more cards until closer to the party. They took the jars full of potion out from under James's bed, being careful as they left the common room since it was close to curfew. James and Sirius were under the invisibility cloak while Remus and Peter walked openly, making their way towards the kitchens. They didn't go clear to the kitchens, instead waiting a few corridors away."D'you think they'll get it in without the elves seeing them?" Peter asked, swinging his legs."Hopefully. They managed last time but... I think the house-elves were a bit busier and therefore more distracted for the Halloween feast than they would be for the Slug Club party."They waited, getting more and more nervous as it grew closer to eight until they knew they couldn't put it off any longer. Exchanging glances, they reluctantly got off the bench and headed back to their dorms. They hated to abandon the other two but didn't want to get in trouble for being out past curfew; it might throw some suspicion on the Marauders. Course they'd probably be blamed anyway.Remus and Peter hung out in the common room, joining Magpie and Nettle for a game of Sphinxes which needed four players. It was mostly Peter's idea, because Remus didn't really want to do anything with anyone else, but didn't argue. He expected to just be paired with Peter but the girls wanted to have a boy-girl team, so Remus partnered with Magpie. Remus was very distracted, trying not to look at the entrance too often. Peter kicked him every single time the portrait opened and Remus figured if he didn't heal he'd have a whole slew of bruises on his shins. Then finally the portrait opened and James and Sirius came in. Remus and Peter were unfortunately in the middle of a round and couldn't just follow them up to the dorm quite yet."Another game?" Magpie asked when she and Remus lost. "Three out of five?""We need to, um, go," Peter said, setting the cards down. "Sorry.""Thanks for playing with us!" Nettle said cheerfully.Peter's cheeks turned a little pink and he quickly scurried off, Remus following. "Were you blushing?" Remus whispered on the stairs."No!" Peter snapped, going redder.Remus opened his mouth but Peter looked so embarrassed he just closed his mouth, deciding not to press it. Neither of them said anything else until they burst into the dorm, demanding to know what happened, did they get the potion in the food or drinks, were they caught? James and Sirius were in very high spirits. They hadn't been caught in the kitchens and managed to get the potion in various foods and drinks. Then they tried to sneak into the party to see, but they were caught doing that. Filch had shown them to Slughorn who reminded James he had been invited, and was more than welcome to go change and come back."Is that what you're doing?" Peter asked, sounding a bit jealous.James shook his head. "Nah. I don't want him thinking I actually wanna join!""Didn't that make him suspicious though?" Remus asked."We just said we wanted to see who all was there," Sirius explained, dropping rather dramatically into his bed. "That's all.""Did... you see anyone... you know... making the noises?" Peter asked then made a face. "I guess I mean hear.""The party was just starting so nope," sighed James. "Very unfortunate."They hung out in the dorm for a while then made their way to the common room hoping it'd be slightly less crowded, but as it was a Friday night and the night before the dance hardly anyone was in their dorm. James and Sirius managed to convince some third years to vacate a sofa somewhat near the fire (there were a few sixth or seventh years right near the fireplace and there wasn't any way to convince them to leave!) and the Marauders took over the couch, playing charades to pass the time.At ten o'clock some of the Slug Club guests started coming in and the Marauders kept up their game while also trying to snatch any conversations about the party. The room was still pretty crowded so only Remus could pick up a few words."They're upset about something," he whispered to his friends.At ten-fifteen Lily came in. Her hair was in an updo and she was wearing a really pretty satin green and white dress, looking very Christmas-y. However, when she spotted the Marauders her eyes narrowed into slits."Oh. It worked," snickered James as Lily stormed towards them."Did you do that?!" she demanded."Do what?" Sirius asked innocently."We're playing charades, Red," James said then gave her a once over. "Red-and-Green. Is that a Slytherin party dress? Did you dress up for your boyfriend?"Lily folded her arms. "Don't make me hex you! I know you were behind what happened!""Wh—what happened?" Remus asked.Lily didn't take her eyes off James. "Half the guests started making animal noises and couldn't stop! Professor Slughorn said some of the drinks had been spiked with a potion that made people sound like barnyard animals!"Remus and Peter tried to hide their laughter but James and Sirius bust up. "Did they? That sounds brilliant!" James said, slapping his thigh.Peter tugged Remus's sleeve and whispered, "Old McSlughorn had a farm."Remus started laughing so hard he fell off the couch. Lily shot him a dirty look but he couldn't stop laughing!"What's so funny?" she demanded. Remus shook his head, unable to answer. "It was awful!""Did you sound like an animal?" Sirius asked."Probably a cow—" James said and didn't get much further as Lily whipped her wand out and hit him with the bat-bogey hex which had fallen out of popularity recently. Globby green bat-shaped bogies yanked out of James's nose and began attacking him."YOU'RE HORRIBLE, JAMES POTTER!" Lily screeched.A prefect ran over, face red with fury, demanding to know what happened. Lily said James called her a cow and she had hexed him. The prefect glanced at James trying to swat the bogies away then at Lily."Ten points from Gryffindor!" he snapped. "No hexing other students!" He flicked his wand and the bogies shlurped to the ground, except for one which landed right on James's head."Isn't he in trouble for calling me a name?!" Lily demanded but the prefect walked off. James pulled at some of the gross mess in his hair then reached out towards Lily who shrieked and dove behind Sirius. She held onto his arms to prevent him from stepping out of the way. "You're disgusting," she growled.Remus sat up, finally able to breathe properly again. "D—did you have fun otherwise?"Lily glanced down at him then back at James before seizing Remus, hauling him to his feet and away from his friends. The other three laughed amongst themselves and Remus apologized for their behavior."It's fine. They're idiots. Yeah. I had a lot of fun. It was better than last year since I wasn't as frightened, though I was sad you weren't there.""Was... Snape...?"Lily smiled. "Yeah. He's joined the Slug Club too. Anyway, I nicked these." She pulled two crackers out of her pockets. "He had them this time and I thought it'd be fun to do with you."Remus flushed with pleasure. "Th-thank you.""But only if you tell me if they did it. I won't snitch. I just want to know." Remus sighed, looking down at his shoes, mumbling incoherently. "Is that a yes?" she pressed."Yes," he whispered. "I had a hand in it too though.""I figured as much." Lily rolled her eyes then put a finger to her lips. "It was funny, actually. Don't tell them that please. I sounded like a donkey. Sev was a sheep. Everyone was going completely crazy, it was really funny."Remus snorted, promising not to tell. Then they both held the ends of each cracker and pulled. Several people yelped, as there was a very loud banging sound, and Remus gave a cry of alarm, dropping whatever he had a hold of and putting his hands to his ears though the sound was over. His head rang with a discomforting noise. Great wafts of purple and green smoke filled the area, Remus and Lily both coughing a bit."I forgot to warn you about that!" she said, apologetically. Then looked down in her hands; she had both the winning ends. "Here." She handed one to him, the purple one. "Are you all right...?""Y—yeah it was really loud." He lowered his hands, still hearing the ringing, but took the purple cracker. Inside was a white boater hat with a purple trim, a small bag of gobstones, a bottle of ice cold cherry soda, a small box of Every Flavor Beans, a dark purple quill, and the joke. "What do you t-tell the abominable snowman when he asks if supper is ready?" he read out and Lily shrugged, putting on the top hat she had received. Remus flipped the paper over. "Not Yeti."They both giggled and then Lily read hers. "What Christmas song do you sing in the dark?" She turned the paper around. "Lumos'ed wonderful time of the year."More giggles. Then, "I'm glad you had fun even with the animal noises.""Thank you. I wish you were there though."He shrugged and then noticed the Marauders were waving at him. "I—I better get back to the others. Thank you for the cracker.""Hey, if I accidentally sleep in tomorrow..." Lily gave him a tight hug right there in front of the entire common room. Remus immediately heard the snickering from his friends. "Happy Christmas.""Happy C-Christmas," he squeaked back, hugging her a bit, wishing that hadn't happened so publicly!Lily disappeared up the girls' stairs and Remus stalked back to his friends, ignoring their ribalding about them being boyfriend and girlfriend, muttering that they weren't it was just a hug please stop. Sirius took the boater hat and put it on Remus's head, making him wear it for the rest of the night./\/\/\/\/\They were up very late in the night and Remus slept in nearly too long in the morning. He only woke up because Struthers woke him up. He sat up, very confused and out of it."It's ten-fifteen," Struthers said. "Aren't you going home today?""MERLIN!' Remus shouted and fell out of bed, getting tangled up in the sheets. He thrashed about and Struthers helped him get untangled. "Th—thank you! Oh Merlin's beard!" He rushed to the bathroom, going as quick as he could, wondering why the Marauders hadn't woken him up. The train left at eleven which, considering it took a bit to get from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade, didn't give him much time. Thank Merlin he had packed last night!He ran back to the dorm, throwing the last few things in his bag then started to leave when he realized he was just in socks. Swearing, he jammed his feet into his ratty trainers then took off, tripping almost right away since he hadn't tied them. He threw himself into a chair in the common room to tie his shoes then ran as fast as he could, going down a few secret passages which helped cut time out. He ran into the Great Hall for a very quick bite to eat, and spotted the Marauders who looked slightly surprised to see him."You forgot to wake me!" he half-accused, collapsing onto the bench next to Peter. "My alarm didn't go off eith—" He stopped talking, seeing the guilt on Peter's face. He glanced at James and Sirius who were eating their food far too innocently. "You—you turned my alarm off, didn't you?""Why would we do that?" James asked.Next to Remus, Peter squirmed uncomfortably. Remus faced him, glaring. "Pete?""Um—""Don't bully Petey, he didn't do anything," Sirius chided.Remus just gave Peter the darkest most threatening look he could. "Yes they did!" Peter squeaked."Oh, thanks a lot!" James moaned, throwing his hands in the air."S-sorry," Peter mumbled. "It wasn't my idea, I swear."Remus turned his glare to the other two."We just figured you know, if you slept in and missed the train... you could go home tomorrow," Sirius said sweetly."And my mum would have wasted all the petrol coming into London, on top of probably going into a panic attack at me not showing up!" Remus hissed out. "You have any idea how expensive—no, of course you don't. We can't just Apparate in and out, or use the Floo network. It costs a decent bit of money to get from Dragon's Field to London, you know, and we don't—oh never mind. I don't have time to argue.""We're sorry—" James started."Oh, I'm sure." He put some bacon and eggs on his plate and began eating as quickly as he could."Remy, don't be mad," Sirius pleaded. Remus just shoved several pieces of bacon into his mouth at once to avoid answering. Sirius gave him puppy dog eyes, and he turned away. "Remyyyy!""I have to go." He grabbed several scones, wrapping them up and dropping them into his pocket. "Happy Christmas."He grabbed his bag and of course they followed him, all of them apologizing. They went outside and Remus and James both hesitated at the sight of the thestrals."I'll never get over those," James muttered.Remus swallowed and started to go forward but Sirius grabbed his sleeve. "Please don't go away mad," he said, sounding very sincere. "We were stupid and thoughtless.""It could have caused a lot of trouble!" he snapped."I know, I realize that now," replied Sirius, brow wrinkled."I should have ignored them and waked you up," Peter said, though Remus didn't really blame him much; he knew he was just doing what the other two told him, and Remus said so. Pete gave a relieved smile."Here." James pulled a galleon out of his pocket. "So you can buy sweets and some food on the train.""I don't want your money," Remus muttered then set the bag down. "All right—no, not that," he said when James tried handing him the galleon again, "I won't go away mad. I mean, I am mad. But."James opened his arm for a hug and Remus gave him a quick hug, and Peter, and then an awkward one with Sirius that sent butterflies fluttering very rapidly through his stomach. Sirius squeezed tightly which made it worse. Remus quickly wriggled free."I'll see you guys in two weeks. Have fun at the dance tonight, Sirius, and a safe trip tomorrow." He picked up his bag and climbed into one of the last carriages leaving./\/\/\/\/\It was agonizingly lonely. Remus had easily found a compartment since hardly anyone was going home. Mostly some first years and a handful of other students, none of whom he knew. He had the compartment all to himself and even though he was bigger than he was on his first trip to Hogwarts, it seemed like there was more space now than there had been on that trip. He wished he had a radio or something, since the silence was terrible.He read, as much as he could, and ate the scones, as well as the sweets he had packed. He picked at some of the every flavor beans, feeling despondent his friends weren't with him to make each other eat the nasty looking ones and laugh at Remus's bad luck. He sighed and threw the nearly full box back into his bag before leaning against the window, watching the snowy landscape go by.Stupid Mum. Stupid Dad, he grumbled to himself, kicking his heels and sighing. What was one more day? It wasn't fair. He stayed over last Christmas holidays due to the full moon.Three more days, he thought, pressing his forehead against the glass. He shuddered, wishing he didn't have to go into the cellar, into that small, cold, cramped place. He wasn't claustrophobic, not by any means; he preferred cramped quarters, it made him feel safer. But just... being in there as the wolf... or even as a human all night... was hellish. He was spoiled by having the entire house in Hogsmeade...He yawned, and drifted into sleep, waking up when the train pulled into Kings Cross station, the horn blaring jarring him from his sleep. He rubbed his eyes and gathered his stuff up. His mother was waiting on the platform, gasping for joy when she saw him and wrapping her arms around him."Mum!""Baby!" She began kissing his face all over, nuzzling into his hair. "My darling! I'm so happy to see you! You've grown!" She let go and stepped back, placing her hand on the top of his head."A bit," he said, blushing.She hugged him again, tight against her chest. 'I've missed you so much. It's agony, you not being there!""I've missed you too!""It's going to be such a nice holiday..." She gave his hair a tousle and it felt kinda weird, making him think too much about Sirius. "Let's get you home."He grabbed his bag and followed her out into the car park through the slush. Soon they were headed west, towards home, and Remus already missed Hogwarts and his friends.

Author's note: trigger warning for child abuse, emotional abuse/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\It felt so weird to be home. Remus went into the house and was greeted cheerfully by his father. Supper was cooking away. Steak. His favorite. Potatoes, veggies, a very nice meal that made him feel bad since he knew it'd be a bit pricey."I'll take your bag to your room, you sit down and relax," Hope said, kissing the top of Remus's head.He sank down into one of the chairs, chest feeling kinda tight. Lyall was smiling, asking how things were, asking how the exams went. Remus said he thought he did well but wouldn't know till later. Then Lyall asked about what books Remus would need from a library to help him study. Remus ducked his head, shrugging."I can just do the research when I get back. I'll have the Sunday before classes start." He traced designs over the plastic-y top of their kitchen table. The dance would be starting soon. He thought of Sirius in his suit, and wished he was there. He and James and Peter would stay up in the common room till Sirius came back—or else creep down to the Great Hall, trying to sneak in. He wondered if they'd pull any pranks. Did they have any of that animal noise potion leftover? That'd be hilariously awful to do. Of course they'd probably try to do something. James and Peter would. Maybe not Sirius. He seemed to take his job as Kim's date pretty seriously.Remus jumped when he realized his father was trying to get his attention; Lyall had been talking, and Remus missed it all."I asked you about the Quidditch game," Lyall said patiently. "You told me you went but didn't talk too much about it.""It was... loud..." Remus said, trying to pretend he couldn't see the disappointment on his father's face, trying to pretend he didn't know perfectly well he wasn't anything like the son Lyall had probably wanted. "Very loud."Hope appeared again, happily taking dinner out of the oven. They all settled in for the food, both his parents peppering him with questions. It felt strange and distant, like it wasn't really happening. He poked at his food, forcing a few bites into his mouth though he wasn't very hungry. Of course, it was just because he was home again after a few months that it felt strange. And he missed his friends. And he was burdened with the huge lie he had to keep as hidden and as secret as possible. He felt it swelling up inside of him like a balloon."Aren't you hungry?" Hope asked, disappointed."I—I'm very tired," he murmured. "It's delicious though, it is. I've missed your cooking."Hope squeezed his hand. "Well, the full moon is coming up soon so of course you're tired." She reached up, stroking his hair. "Poor thing. You didn't talk much about the moons during school. Were they okay?"Remus thought of the one in October, of how exhausted he was, of how much weight he lost; then the one in November, with his destroyed leg. Had McGonagall written to his parents about being caught in a lie? He still didn't know if they knew he had been left alone during the day a few times... "They were... all right," he forced out. "The usual." He eyed his parents, watching them carefully for any signs that they knew.They didn't seem to, although with very careful prying he did discover they had known (and given permission) about him being in the house during the days. They were, naturally, informed when Remus went back to what had been done during his first year; they did not appear to know the exact details, and Remus was glad.The conversation changed back to school and his grades, and soon he was done with it. He didn't really feel like talking much—plus he was sorta worried if he kept talking about school everything would just slip out. Finally he said he was just far too tired, apologized for not eating much, then went up to his room. He dug Gwyllgi out of his bag and collapsed on the bed. It was an old mattress, probably as old as him if not older, and rather worn. Lyall had enchanted it a few times to keep it plump and fluffy but it was sagging in the middle. The box springs underneath were worn out too. It wasn't anywhere near as comfortable as his bed at Hogwarts. The blanket wasn't as comfortable either.Stop comparing! he scolded himself, curling into a little ball, hugging Gwyllgi tightly. This is home, you should be happy to be here.But he simply... wasn't./\/\/\/\/\Remus still felt down in the morning and only ate a little bit of breakfast to Hope's dismay. She felt his forehead even though they both knew he couldn't get sick. He promised he felt fine, just wasn't very hungry, that's all."Are you up to putting the tree up? And decorations?" Hope asked. "Your father wanted to get that done tonight.""Yeah, that will be fun," Remus said with a smile.Shortly after eleven (around the time the Hogwarts Express would be leaving) he wondered how his friends were doing, how the dance went, how soon he'd get a letter. They knew not to write him on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, but would he get a letter tonight? Or tomorrow? He hoped so. Lily didn't know not to write during the full moons so the only thing that could be done in that regard was pray she didn't send anything during that period.He spent most of the day puttering around the house, trying to seem happy whenever he was around his mother, trying not to act too suspicious. He set himself up in the living room to work on some homework while Hope knitted and the radio played older music. Sinatra, Fitzgerald, Crosby, etc. Remus very carefully wrote out an essay, feeling a heaviness around them, wondering if his mother could feel it too. He was on edge, waiting for her to look up and say, By the way, about your friends...But she didn't. Lyall came home a bit early so they could start decorating the house. They got some sticks from the woods which Lyall transfigured into a Christmas tree (a big, full, nice, proper one) then began putting up the old decorations as Christmas music played. Remus frowned at some of the really bleh looking decorations. He didn't mind the sentimental ones, really, but he wished they had more. They were using the exact same decorations since 1964, 1965, and he sorta wanted a bit of a change."Hey, maybe I can make some new tinsel," he suggested brightly. "Surely there's a spell for that.""You're not supposed to use magic out of school," Lyall replied, not taking his eyes off the tree."Well... you can make some new tinsel, couldn't you?""I don't know of a spell like that.""We could get a book and I could research—""Remus," Lyall warned, finally turning to face him. Remus fell silent. "If you want me to return your Christmas present and buy you a book about tinsel-related spells, I will, if that's what you really want, but we're not made of money and you know that."Remus started to protest that he meant the library before realizing how exhausted his father was. Normally Lyall didn't work on Sundays, but due to the holiday coming up the owner had decided to stay open in case of extra business. He wondered when the last time Lyall had a day off. And it was all because of him, and his bite."S—sorry," he mumbled, dropping the subject. His hands shook so hard that a glass ball slid from his fingers and shattered at his feet."Look what you did!" Lyall snapped, grabbing Remus's shoulder and yanking him back away from the glass. Remus stumbled a bit, his shoulder hurting briefly where his father's fingers had dug in."Sorry!""Can you fix it?" Hope asked, wringing her hands."Reparo!" Lyall flicked his wand and some of the glass reformed. "Reparo!" But it had shattered into too many tiny pieces for Lyall's ability to fix."Oh, that was my mother's," Hope said, distraught. "She gave it to me for our first Christmas together!"Remus took a few steps back. "I—I'm s-s-sorry!""Go get a broom and clean it up," Lyall ordered.Remus fled to the kitchen and returned with the broom and dustpan, sweeping the mess up, blinking back tears. He made sure to get every last piece. "Do you w-want to keep it and see if I can fix it in a few years?"Lyall's hand flung out and Remus cringed back, expecting a blow; instead Lyall hissed through clenched teeth, fist trembling slightly as he seemed to resist the urge to punish Remus. "Just. Throw it. Away!"Remus ran to the kitchen and dumped the shards of glass into the rubbish bin, a few tears plonking in after. Guilt tore at him. If he hadn't been bothering his father about the ornaments, if he hadn't been so shaky... He took in a deep breath, rubbing his eyes till the tears stopped. When he crept back into the living room the tree was almost done. Hope was very sad, Lyall still angry, and Remus tried to stay calm. He wanted to just go hide under his bed for the rest of the holidays./\/\/\/\/\Dear Remus!it sucks without you! but I had tons of fun at the dance. it was awesome! the Hufflepuffskeins didnt play there though but there was this new group called the Red Cap Rockers. they were pretty good! I made loads of guys mad. I guess Seo-Yun is pretty popular. one guy phizically threatened me and I just said fine piss off the Beater great idea. he tried to call me a weakling for 'letting a girl fight for me' and I just said shes got more muscles in her pinkies than he does in his head which is saying a lot. I nearly got hexed. it was great! we danced a lot and I think the punch I had might have been spiked but I'm not sure. your the only one who has any expeerience on that. HAHA! anyway, we didnt have time to develop Petey's pictures so he said he'll send him later on. I hope we have dances in the future when were old enough to go. YOU WILL GO! OR ELSE! okay? cool.Sirius/\/\/\/\/\Remus stayed in bed Monday morning until his mother came and got him. He wished he could feign being sick, really not wanting to leave his room... but of course he couldn't. He rolled out of his bed and trudged down the stairs, hoping his dad had already left for work and feeling rather anxious when he saw him sitting at the table. He was reading the newspaper, finishing up his breakfast. They had barely spoken any the night before and Remus felt ill as he slid silently into his usual seat, fixating his stare on his food. Hope tried to fill the silence but it didn't negate the tension.Remus pushed his eggs around on the plate, wondering if he should apologize again. He jumped when Lyall set the paper down."Bye Remus. Bye darling." He got up and kissed Hope's cheek then headed out to Apparate to Caerphilly.Remus slumped down, breathing out a sigh though he wasn't sure if it was relief or not."Are you all right?" Hope asked, picking up Lyall's dishes.He shook his head. "I feel terrible for breaking the ornament last night. I... I know how much it meant to you...""Oh, sweetheart, accidents happen," Hope said but he could hear the sadness tinged in her voice and he felt even worse."I—I'm not very hungry...""You hardly ate last night." Hope turned around, face full of concern. "Is something going on?"Yeah, I mess everything up. "No, I just... I'm very tired.""It seems like it's affecting you more than usual..." Hope sat down next to him, stroking his hair.It's not the moon, it's everything else! But he didn't know how to explain. He remembered Your Body at Hogwarts talking about mood swings, but he wasn't sure if this was one of them or not. He just felt so despondent and miserable and guilty and wanted to hide. He hated being at home. He—he loved it, but he hated it and he wanted to go back to Hogwarts, and he knew it was wrong to feel this way so he just felt worse, but his parents felt... felt... just felt like too much! It was overwhelming. They were overwhelming. He felt physical disgust at his mother stroking his hair like that and then hated himself for feeling that way. She was his mother and she loved him, but the thought of her touching him like that, like he was a baby was infuriating!But he didn't want to upset her in any way so he remained silent, gritting his teeth as her fingers raked through his hair. He just let her think it was the moon doing this to him. Because he sure as hell had no idea what the real reason was.../\/\/\/\/\Dear Remus, 17/12/72here at the pictures from the dance! well from rite before the dance cuz i didnt go to it. james and i tried to sneek in but we got caut right away. oops. anyway I woke up real early today to develop them so i could send them to you and the others. this should get to you on Monday nite which i hope is okay. you said tuesday and wendsday and thursday were no good right? i really hope i got that right. if i messed up i am SO SORRY!Im writing this on the train and will send it when i get home tonite. James Sirius and me stole some of the transfiguration animals this morning... well they did i didnt i was busy with the photos. so we let them loose a bit ago in some of the compartmints.I am really really really exited for when we xchange presents becuz i think your going to really like mine to you. I hope you do. it might just be stupid tho. if you dont like it its okay and you can give it back and ill give you something else. it will be ok if that happins. I sometimes feel bad about presents becuz i dont know what to do. i dont have money like James and all i can really do is small stuff and the photos. tho your present is something else and not that. now i shouldnt say anything else i dont want to ruin the surprise.see you in a cuple weeks!PeterRemus shuffled through the pictures, seeing his friends which gave him an aching pain in his chest. Sirius all dressed up and shooting a grin at the camera, Sirius and James with their arms around one another, one of Sirius and Peter... Sirius in the common room putting the flowers on Kim's wrist, then one of the two of them with their arms around each other's waists. Despite the age difference, they were about the same height. They looked pretty good together.Remus flipped back to the one of Sirius by himself. He looked absolutely fantastic, and somehow his hair seemed even nicer than usual. He looked genuinely happy and excited, and it was probably one of the nicest pictures Remus had ever seen of Sirius.He flopped back on his bed, staring at the picture for ages until he knew he couldn't stay up much longer. He hid the letter and photos in his mattress and then managed to get to sleep, images of Sirius dancing with a blurry figure drifting through his head./\/\/\/\/\Hope let Remus sleep in on Tuesday morning, and he didn't trudge down to the kitchen until nearly noon. Hope had a very large meal for him that she demanded he eat, since he hadn't eaten much supper the night before. Lyall... was still obviously not pleased with Remus and it killed his appetite."Th—thank you." He sat down and stared at the meal before him and then began poking at the pie, trying to convince himself to eat. He needed to. He knew he needed to for the transformation tonight... but he just didn't feel like eating. He forced several bites down then couldn't do anymore. Hope hemmed and hawed, hovering around him, urging him to take a few more bites. "Maybe I'll be hungrier in an hour or so. Or you could leave food out in the cellar and I'll eat it as a wolf—""Remus!" she shrieked, hands fluttering to her mouth. "No, don't—that's not—you know we don't talk about... the nights."Remus thought of the Marauders' curious questions and felt a burning desire to just say, Why not? What if I want to talk about it? It's my body! It's my curse! It's me! Let me talk about it! "Okay, Mummy..."Shortly before sunset they went down in the cellar and Remus hesitated, not wanting to undress in front of her. He had been getting uncomfortable with it over the past year and now he flat out didn't want to. It was bad enough Pomfrey seeing his naked body. He asked her to wait outside the door, with the door open just a crack and he'd hand the clothes out to her."Why?" she asked."I—I don't... I'd rather not..." He floundered for an answer since he knew she'd be seeing him in the morning when she came in to retrieve his broken body. "Please?""Are you hiding something?" she asked."No. I just... I'd rather not be watched," he said awkwardly. "And... maybe in the morning just... toss me a blanket... or something? Once I feel up to walking I can just go up to the bathroom—""I am not leaving you in there!" Hope looked horrified at the thought.He shifted, rubbing his elbow, realizing this was all futile. "I'm twelve years old, I don't—it's—I don't want you seeing me!""I'm your mother—"He began to grow red. "Mother, please!" he squeaked. "Can't I have some privacy?!"Hope stared at him, face going a little blank. "Fine," she said stiffly, and stepped back, closing the door so it was open just a crack. "What is it you want me to do in the morning?""J... just... t-toss a blanket in... p—please...""Very well." She sounded extremely hurt, and he grew even guiltier.Great, that's how this entire holiday is going to go, isn't it?! he thought angrily as he stripped off. Me feeling guilty all the time. Me being a crap son. Is it so wrong to want a little privacy? He looked down at his bare body. He had gotten quite a bit more hair down there. It was kinda embarrassing.He slipped his hand out through the crack, handing his mother his clothes. "I love you," he said, pressing his face to the crack so he could see her."I love you too," she replied, still sounding injured. "I'll see you in the morning."The cellar door swung shut, and she locked the outside.Remus sat down on the cold stone floor, hugging his knees, shivering hard as he waited for the moon to rise./\/\/\/\/\He came to in the morning, his human mind expanding back as the wolf shrank, crying out as his body twisted back to its usual form. He lay there, panting heavily for a bit, staring at the darkness. Slowly he sat up and began carefully feeling his body for any injuries. Bad gashes and bite marks all over his legs and both arms, and the usual torn muscles. It was pretty rough.Twenty minutes later the door creaked open. "Remus?""H... hi.""Do you... still just want the sheet?""Yes, please."Her hand appeared, a sheet dangling down. He took it and wrapped it around his body, putting a hand against the wall to steady himself as he got to his feet. He limped out into the light and Hope gave a sharp intake of breath at the blood soaking through the sheet already. She helped him up to the upper floor and into his bathroom where she drew him a warm bath; she waited until realizing he didn't want her there either."I've bathed you every single morning after the moons you're at home," she said, sounding on the verge of tears. "Remus, darling, why are you being like this?""I—I don't want to upset you," he answered honestly, 'I just—I'm twelve now, I'll be thirteen the next time I transform here at home!""I know. You're growing up so fast." She suddenly hugged him tightly, sobbing into his shoulder. He buckled a little under the sudden weight, and tried not to make any noises to indicate how much this hurt his destroyed limbs. "You're becoming a young man!""That's—that's exactly wh-what I'm t-trying to say!" He thought through some other possible responses then said, "Would—would you want your father seeing you naked at thirteen?""No but that is completely different! I'm your mother, I gave birth to you!"Remus remained silent, no idea what to say to this. Finally he whispered, "Please?"She let go of him, blood soaked into her dress. She looked down at her arms then back up at him. He didn't move, didn't say anything, barely dared to breathe. Hope bent in and kissed a spot on his head that didn't have very much blood on it, then drifted out of the bathroom leaving a trail of sadness./\/\/\/\/\Winter months were awful. He only had around seven hours before disappearing back into the cellar, before his father even got home. He had spent the day mostly sleeping, and trying to eat. He managed to get quite a bit down, doing his best to ignore his mother's disappointment. When she went with him to the cellar she gave him a few glances before shutting the door except for a crack, and taking his clothes from him. When morning brought him back into human form—bloody and in a lot of pain—she put the blood-stained (but clean) sheet through the door. He really needed her help to get through the house, in too much pain to get to the upper floor so he wound up curling up in his parents' bathtub. He felt weaker and weaker as his blood ebbed out of his body and down the drain."You look so thin," Hope said as she tucked him into bed, dressed in comfortable pajamas with bandages around his wounds. "Are you hungry?""Too tired to eat," he mumbled, falling back asleep before she even left the room.When she brought lunch she sat on the edge of his bed, watching him eat, smoothing down her skirt, obviously wanting to talk about something. He thought it would be about his privacy again but once he finished the last bite she pulled an envelope and a small package out of her pocket. Remus recognized Lily's writing and he tried not to groan."This came for you last night," she said."What is it?" he asked, hoping he sounded innocent."A letter and a gift." She handed the letter over, keeping the present in her lap. "Who is it from?"Remus opened up the letter, acting as if he didn't know. "Oh, it's from someone in my study group," he said very lightly. "Oh! I know what this must be. She borrowed a book from me and lost it. She said she'd replace it." He knew she'd get him a book for Christmas even if the shape didn't bely the surprise."It looks like a Christmas gift," Hope said flatly, plucking at one of the curly gold ribbons.Remus shrugged, folding the letter back up, far too tired to deal with this right now. "She likes wrapping presents.""Can I open it, then?"He felt his breath catch in his throat. Would he be able to pass whatever book off as one he had before? His parents knew most of his books, except for the ones from his friends, or the two he had bought in Hogsmeade (and Merlin knew they would never, ever, ever find out about Your Body!). "Can I open it on Christmas and pretend it's an extra present?" he asked meekly.Hope's eyes softened and she nodded. "Of course. I know Christmas can be disappointing...""Oh! Oh no, Mum, not at all. I love everything you and Dad get me. I promise. It's not disappointing at all. It's usually more than I expect!"Hope bent in and they exchanged hugs, Remus being careful not to hug her too tight. "I love you, baby boy.""I love you too, Mum." He kissed her cheek and then she got up, taking the empty tray away. Remus picked up Lily's present, examining it closely. If he unwrapped it very carefully then he should be able to reuse the paper and just wrap up one of his own books. That should work. He put the present in his desk drawer, hoping his mother wouldn't snoop. He... wanted to trust her but something he worried. After a second he took the present back out.Feeling beyond weary, he pushed his bed up and cut into the place where he kept letters over the summer. He put Lily's letter and the present there, flinching in pain as one his wounds reopened from the effort of holding the mattress up. A quick flick from his wand along with a spell that took too much effort for him to pant out repaired the mattress. He gladly lowered it back onto the box springs, collapsing immediately down onto it. After a moment of resting he dragged himself farther onto the bed and fell back asleep almost right away.

Author's note: a couple things. First of all, physical child abuse in this chapter as well as the emotional abuse/emotional manipulation. Also, shout out to Angel for helping me with the French, but the Welsh is taken from google translate so I sincerely apologize for any mistakes there. :T/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus didn't transform his final night. He was awake, shivering hard and drifting in and out of nightmare-riddled sleep; images of him ripping his friends to pieces filled his head every time he closed his eyes. It felt like the darkness of the small room pressed against him, and eventually he stood up, his bare feet slapping quietly against the floor as he paced. He made dozens and dozens of laps before he tried to sleep again, managing to snatch a short little nap before he woke up screaming and crying.Finally dawn came and his mother handed him the bloodied sheet. He covered himself and left the room. Hope's eyes lit up when she realized he didn't have any wounds on his body."It snowed," she said brightly as they went through the house. "I was hoping it would be a nice night for you."Remus bit back a comment about how he preferred to be a wolf; he didn't think she would understand. They got to his room and he curled up in bed naked for a few minutes, cold, but too tired to get dressed."Want me to get you into your pajamas?" she asked."No thank you…"She went quiet. "Want me to get them at least?" she offered."Yes, please, thank you."She set a pair of pajamas on his bed, planted a kiss on his cheek, then left the room. Remus lay still, nearly falling asleep, then forcing himself to sit up and get the clothing on. They were warm, flannel pajamas, way too big for him but comfy. He kicked the stained sheet off his bed and then buried himself under his blankets, sleeping until Hope woke him up for lunch."What day is it?" he asked, struggling to remember."Friday. Christmas is on Monday," she said, watching him eat. "Your father needs to work Sunday. Ottilie thinks they may get some last minute customers."Remus paused, the food turning heavy and lumpish in his stomach. "Oh." He poked at the rice miserably. "How… is he doing…?""He's worried about you," she replied and Remus couldn't help but wonder if that was true.As it turned out, it probably wasn't because after dinner Lyall wanted to talk to Remus privately. They went up to his room and Remus sat on his bed, hands tucked under his thighs to keep them from shaking.Lyall began pacing, running his fingers through his blonde hair. "Your mother told me what's happened."Remus swallowed, wriggling a bit. Lily's letter and present? he wondered."You really hurt her," Lyall continued. "I know you're… getting older. But it's not a very nice thing to push your mother away." Oh, that was what was going on. "She's given you so much. She's given up so much. We both have."Remus ducked his head, shame burning through his entire body. "I know," he whispered."Do you? Because from what I understand, you didn't.""I—I'm twelve," he said, very hoarsely. "I'll be thirteen soon. I—I just w-wanted some privacy. I'm not a baby anymore."Lyall gave him a look. "You're right. You're not a baby. So you should at least understand how much your words and actions hurt her. She misses you every single day you're away and then you come home only to shove her away from you. Brooding around, hiding in your room...""D—Dad—""I know there's not much you can do this time of the month—you need to rest—but you had no right to lash out at her!""I d-d-didn't lash out—"Lyall held up his hand. "Remus, I'm talking. Please just listen."Remus closed his mouth and looked down at his lap."I know you want some privacy but the fact is because of what you are you have to give up some of it. There will be mornings you are too… too far destroyed to move. One of us will need to come in and get you. What happens at Hogwarts?"Remus startled at that question, not expecting it. He had just been told to be quiet! "In the… mornings?" he asked, to be sure, and Lyall nodded. "P… Madame Pomfrey comes and gets me.""She sees you?"Remus turned bright red. "Yes…""So, she sees your body but you don't want your mother?""I—I don't want Pomfrey to see either!" he protested, getting to his feet. "I don't want anyone!""I know. I understand. But you're not a typical boy, Remus; there are some things others have you simply cannot expect to have."Remus just stared at his father. "I can't have privacy," he said flatly. Lyall opened his mouth but Remus continued, "That's not fair.""Life isn't fair—""I know that!" he snapped, face reddening even more, the wolf rising up inside of him as his temper flared. Lyall's eyes went big. "You think I don't? With what I have?! I know damn well life isn't fair—""Watch your language," Lyall spat out."Pa iaith ddylwn i ei gwylio? Hwn? Ou peut-être en français?!" Remus spat right back then pulled back, wishing he could take it back, wishing he hadn't lost his temper.Lyall's hand lashed out hard and Remus went crashing to the floor, face stinging. He tried apologizing but Lyall just stormed out of his room, slamming the door shut behind him. Remus whimpered, scrambling back, hand against his cheek. The pain faded but he could still feel it, and he began to grow terrified of Fawley seeing this. Maybe he could just ask her not to look into any memories over Christmas. Would she agree?I deserved it, he thought, rubbing his face, hearing his father shouting downstairs, complaining about Remus's attitude. I'm ungrateful. I've hurt them, I lost my temper. I deserved that. He pulled himself up onto his bed, hugging Gwyllgi tightly. I need to be a better son./\/\/\/\/\Supper was beyond tense and the only reason Remus went down was because of his mother. He sullenly sat at his side of the table while Lyall sat silently at his, and Hope did her best to fill the silence. Lyall talked a bit with her, but since Remus didn't say anything to him, Lyall didn't say anything back.Then Remus set his fork down. "I'm sorry," he said, and Hope went silent. "I'm—I'm sorry for hurting you, Mum. And for talking back, Dad.""Apology accepted," Lyall said, smiling a little bit. "Thank you for apologizing."Hope took Remus's hand. "It's all right. I know it's a difficult age."The air was a lot clearer, and while his parents were merrier, Remus didn't say another word as he finished eating. He excused himself and fled up to his room, trying not to slam the door. He kicked at his desk and it scooted back, banging into one of his bookcases and sending a few books to the floor. He sighed and began picking them up, then he checked his desk and saw he had splintered a chunk off. Great, he thought, pushing his desk back to its rightful place.He sat down, listening for any sign of his parents coming up, then got Lily's present out of the mattress. Slowly he opened it up and found Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. He smiled, reading the blurb, growing excited to read it. Then he got one of his books from his bookcase—one that wasn't too battered—and rewrapped it in Lily's paper, using a sticking spell even though she had used Muggle tape. Then he put Lily's book in his bag before fetching the letter from her, excited to read.Dear Remus,Happy Christmas! The present is a bit early, but my family will be going to visit some cousins over the weekend so I thought I'd send it now. My cousins don't know I'm a witch so I won't be able to have Bessie with me. She's going to go back to Hogwarts for a bit, since Severus stayed behind for the holidays, otherwise I'd've asked him to watch her. I'd ask you to watch her but I should have done so before we left, and I don't want to put any pressure on you.Anyway, I hope you like the book! It's pretty good. I wasn't too crazy about it but I think you'll probably enjoy it. Maybe it will make more sense to you!So Cassie's told me she's giving Black a Christmas present but she won't tell me what it is. I dunno, Black's pretty handsome but his personality is YUCK! I don't know what she really sees in him. Do you think they'll start dating soon? They're both thirteen already so I guess that's not too weird. I can't believe I'll be thirteen soon! I wonder what it's like? Cassie said nothing's changed. Ali's got to wait till May!I've been thinking about a lot of things recently and I think I'd like to be kissed soon. Is that awkward to say? I'm sorry if I'm bothering you. How do you feel? I know you were upset about things a few weeks ago but I wasn't sure if anything's changed. I guess I feel like there is all this pressure for the First Kiss. I read about it all the time, and in movies and on TV. That Special First Kiss. It's kind of driving me crazy. What if it's terrible? What if I've got a boyfriend and we have our first kiss and I'm so terrible he dumps me?So, I want to have it now, and get it done with. I don't know WHO I'd kiss though. Honestly I'd rather just have it be you or Severus since you're my friends and you guys know it wouldn't mean anything and I could get my first kiss OVER with... but THAT is probably VERY awkward! Don't hate me, okay? Haha.Well, I better wrap up this letter, it's probably awful and I should rewrite it, but I'm sending it anyway. I hope you aren't too weirded out by my rambling.Love,LilyRemus folded the letter up and put it in his school bag, tucking it into a book, VERY glad his mother hadn't demanded to read it! He felt himself blushing hard at the kissing thing although he wondered… maybe he should. What if he kissed Lily? A girl? Would that trigger him into being normal?He lay down on his bed, staring up at the ceiling, feeling as though he was about to tip off a cliff with how buzzy and strange he felt. Dare he? Kiss Lily? As long as they both made it clear it meant nothing? Or did it meaning nothing mean it wouldn't... do anything, wouldn't feel right? Should he? Could he?He tried to picture kissing Lily and his body sort've felt shrively as he physically recoiled on his bed. The thought of kissing her was... terrible. But maybe it wouldn't be. Get it over with... maybe... that's really what he should do... plus kissing a girl, that might help things, might fix things. Might be like using an erasing spell on a piece of parchment and get rid of all those weird, unwanted thoughts in his head about—well.He rolled over, curling up, musing over this new possibility./\/\/\/\/\At least things for his parents were easier, even if he felt bitter. The weekend had been very long and agonizing and he destroyed a multitude of letters in reply to Lily about kissing. Maybe he'd talk to her in person or would that be worse? He absolutely burned at the thought of talking to her like that.However, that was something to worry about another day.Because it was Christmas!He bounced out of bed and ran down the steps, grinning when he saw his stocking full. It was early and neither of his parents were up yet so he tiptoed into the kitchen and began making breakfast for them."Remus!" Hope gasped when she came into the kitchen, tightening her bathrobe. He whirled around, worried she'd be mad, but her face was very soft. "This is wonderful!""Happy Christmas, Mum!""Oh, Happy Christmas, sweetheart!" She kissed his cheek, and he kissed hers back. "Lyall, look what Remus did."Lyall came in, smiling broadly as he slid his arm around Hope's waist. "You made us breakfast?" Remus nodded, feeling a little apprehensive. But Lyall just pat Remus's shoulder. "Thank you, kiddo!"They all sat down and ate the bacon and eggs, then headed into the living room to open everything. Remus's stocking was very simple as it usually was. A nice new quill, an orange, and a bar of chocolate. He loved it. Then it came time for the presents. This year he had three from his parents which he eagerly ripped into. The first was a knitted blanket in Gryffindor colors which he wrapped around himself. The next was a small bag with several balls of yarn in it."Oh, thank you!" he said excitedly.Hope grinned. "I'm glad you're enjoying knitting."Lyall just gave a slight hmph sound. "Hope the colors are all right, " he grumbled, obviously not as keen on his son knitting as his wife was. "The last one is from me."Remus opened it and practically shrieked. It was a very nice, rather fancy notebook. It was scarlet, and on the front it had a gold lion enchanted to stalk back and forth, its tail whipping, giving silent roars. It was quite thick, and the pages were of good quality. It must have been pretty pricey."I hope that's the sort of notebook you wanted," Lyall said lightly."Thank you!" Remus said, hugging it to his chest. He was so excited to have something like this, to jot down all his pranking ideas and things he needed to research for in regards to Marauder-y things. "Thank you for everything."Hope held her arms out and Remus hugged her, and Lyall gave his head a pat. Remus sat down cross-legged while his parents finished opening their presents, and unwrapped his chocolate bar to eat. The rest of the day went very nice. Remus spent a long time carefully writing down things he remembered he was supposed to research as well as a few of his own prank ideas. An excited sort of shiver went down his spine as he wrote these down.At least his mother seemed to forget about him opening Lily's present so he ripped the paper off and put his book back on the shelves.That night he got three letters, from all the Marauders. They were all relatively short. Peter's was about the skiing trip he was supposed to go on but never did because apparently his mother and aunt had a huge fight and his mother decided not to let him go. He wasn't sure how to feel about it but was relieved he didn't have to worry about breaking his leg. Sirius's was very short, mostly talking about how much he missed his friends and school. James's was the longest, rambling about holiday plans, how he missed them all, he hoped Remus was having a good time, wait till they all got back to school and he could show them a Big Surprise! and the rest of the letter was full of random stuff.Remus wrote back to all of them. Filibuster had already left but Godric stayed, so Remus attached James's letter to him; he was very nervous and took off as soon as Remus was done. He then attached Peter and Sirius's letters to Cocoa, asking Cocoa to please take the extra letter to Sirius. Cocoa hooted and flew off.Remus went over to Arthur and gave him some nuzzles and kisses. "I'm not going to push you," he promised, stroking Arthur's chest. Arthur hooted and nibbled at Remus's nose gently./\/\/\/\/\Hope was very miserable on Boxing Day, rattling dishes as she slammed them down. She made it clear she was upset Remus was going to be leaving again in just a few days. Remus was surprised to realize that yeah, he'd be going back to Hogwarts on Saturday. Already! The first week had gone by pretty fast of course he had spent most of him either recovering from the full moon, being a wolf, or being depressed over being such a failure of a son."I don't understand why it couldn't be after New Years," Hope sniffled, sitting down."The holidays have always been two weeks," Remus replied. "It was either a week before Christmas and a week after, or everyone coming home on the twenty-third and going home a week into January.""Still. When are the Easter holidays?"Remus swallowed some porridge, trying to remember. "I think it's the fourteenth through the twenty-eighth in April.""And then after that, summer," Hope said with a smile."That is a long way away though," Remus reminded her and her smile stiffened. Lyall lowered the newspaper a bit, giving Remus a dark look. He mumbled something that might have been (another) apology and returned to his breakfast."I am so sick of these rich twats flashing their vaults around," Lyall complained after a couple minutes. "Isn't this your roommate, Remus?""Huh?"Lyall slapped the paper down, gesturing with annoyance. Remus peered at the newspaper article and his blood began boiling.Potter Patriarch Donates StarShooter For Raffle!There was a photograph of James's StarShooter along with a little article about how it only cost a galleon to enter the raffle, and all proceeds would be going to Hogwarts to be split between the Quidditch pitch and the library. The broom hadn't been used much, just for some Quidditch practices during the autumn term, and one game (won)."Honestly," Lyall snorted. "Just showing off they can afford to do that sort of thing.""I think it's nice," Hope said, leaning over Remus's shoulder to read the article. "It will help the school, won't it?""From what I understand, the Potters have donated more than enough money to the school." Lyall shook his head. "I'm surprised it's not being renamed The Potter School. Fleamont is a Governor. I bet that Potter roommate of yours throws that around a lot, hmm?""Not… really," he replied honestly, trying his best not to sound too furious."Well… it's going to the library too. That's very nice of them. That helps you," Hope joked, patting Remus's shoulder."Yeah," he mumbled, glaring at the newspaper, wondering if he could get away with throttling James. The worst part was he probably wouldn't be able to write to James about it either. He doubted Godric would return with a letter in time, and he wasn't going to send Arthur on the trip. OOH that James! How could he? How could he!?Remus was in a very grumpy mood for the rest of the day, kicking around, getting all worked up every time he thought of the article, thought of the fact James bloody donated his stupid bloody broom, that bloody twat! He should have known. Should have known James would get a new broom. He had assumed... but of course James was spoiled. He was a wonderful person, but spoiled, and Remus should have known.Remus slumped down, tired from all the raging. It was James's decision but... he still felt like it was all his fault.../\/\/\/\/\Remus got another letter from Lily, one from Peter, and one from Sirius, but nothing from James. Surprise, surprise, the damned coward.On Thursday night he spent the time wrapping up his friends' presents. For Lily, a book: one of his favorite wizarding fiction books he had read multiple times growing up. He was giving her his own copy with an added inscription in the front, hoping a used book would be okay. He also had biscuits for her too. For the Marauders: matching scarves, as well as sweets because he was simply too anxious that handmade stuff wasn't enough. The scarves had taken a long time to get done, but once he got into the rhythm they weren't too bad. Nothing fancy, just solid blocks of color—red and gold, naturally.He wrapped them up and hid them in a box under his bed full of childhood stuff until he could pack them, so his mother wouldn't see.On Friday he spent the day making sure he had everything packed up, and mostly finished his assignments. He'd have to properly finish them at school, in the library where he'd have the resources. He figured they were all right but of course wanted to make sure they were perfect.Then Saturday morning dawned and he threw himself out of bed and into his clothes. Back to Hogwarts! he thought, hopping around one footed as he struggled to get his second sock on. He tripped and banged his shoulder against his dresser, yelping in pain. Sitting on the floor, he got the sock on, then realized they were different colors and patterns. He wasn't sure where either matching one was so he just shrugged and got his shoes on as the pain in his shoulder faded."Morning!" he said brightly as he went down to breakfast.Hope gave him a look but he didn't let it get to him. He was too happy. Two weeks of—well, he didn't want to call it agony but it kinda felt that way sometimes. Then the guilt returned for feeling that way. At least his parents never figured out he had friends (or that his friends knew the truth)! He gave his mother a kiss on the cheek then sat down, making sure to compliment her cooking and thanking her for the meal."Are you all packed up?" she asked tightly."Yeah. I have to bring a second bag so I can take my blanket," he said. "It's so cozy. I love it."At least she smiled at that.Soon Lyall went to work and after what felt like an eternity Remus and Hope piled into the car. They both argued a bit over the radio (Remus wanted rock music, Hope wanted her era; Hope won) then headed towards London.Stars shining bright above you, night breezes seem to whisper I love you... birds singing in the sycamore tree... dream a little dream of me...Remus saw how sad his mother looked. This was so hard on her, and he wasn't making it any easier."I'm going to miss you," he said.Her knuckles whitened a bit as she tightened her grip on the wheel. "Will you?""Of course I will. I always miss you, Mum. I love you.""I love you too, darling. I... I know you love school..."Remus looked out the window, the snowy landscape passing by. "I do. Very much. But... it's not going to be forever, you know. I only have five and a half more years." He began plucking at the sleeve of his jumper. Five and a half more years, he thought, sick. It felt far away but sounded like it would be over immediately. Then no more Hogwarts.No more Marauders.He swallowed and curled his fingers into fists, trying to stop himself from getting too shaky. He spent the rest of the trip trying to think of anything but graduation. It's ages, it's forever, you have a long, long time at school...Then they were in London, Hope maneuvering the car through the crowded streets and into a parking space at Kings Cross. The two of them headed to Platforms Nine and Three Quarters while he prayed Lily or Aegis wouldn't be around. The Marauders knew not to approach him now (a blessing!) but the others didn't.The platform was so crowded it was hard to see anyone. He hugged his mother tightly, allowing her to kiss all over his face. They said their goodbyes (tearful on his mother's side of things) and then Remus hauled his two bags onto the train to search for his friends.

Author's note: I told my mom who is currently in the hospital that I'd dedicate this chapter to her :) I love you and miss you and can't wait to see you. When I called her yesterday she wanted to know why the next chapter wasn't up yet, so here you go haha/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\It didn't take Remus too long to find the other Marauders. On the second section of train he went down, he saw a sign that said, Do Not Enter Upon Penalty Of The Bat-Bogey Hex (which gave him the perfect idea) on a door with loud music thumping. He rolled his eyes and knocked, then ducked into the compartment across the aisle, ignoring the stares the three fifth years sitting in the compartment gave him. He put a finger to his lips as he heard the music get louder as one of the Marauders opened the door. Once the music quieted he slid back out and knocked again, then hid again."Oi!" he heard James complain.The fifth years were grinning now, amused. Remus hurried over and knocked one more time.The door slammed open. "RIGHT!" James yelled, wand at the ready. The surprise on his face made Remus laugh. "Remy!" he shrieked and flung his arms around him, hugging tightly. The fifth years were laughing as James dragged Remus into the compartment, shutting the door.Remus hugged him back before getting his wand out. "Nasusmuscapelli!""Wh—"James flailed and fell back into a seat as hairy bat bogies yanked out of his nose and began attacking him."Remus! What the bloody hell?!" He swatted at them, grunting and whining. "Finite inca—" One of the bogies tried to get into his mouth. "White—flauuugggghhhh—" he yelped as one hit him right in the face.Remus waited another moment before rescuing James. "Finite incantatem!" he said, and the bogies fell.James sat upright, adjusting his glasses which had streaks on them. He made a face and dug a cleaning kit out of his bag. "What in Merlin's name did I do to deserve—"Remus pulled the newspaper article out of his pocket and held it up, glaring.James faltered then slowly smiled, that charming Potter smile. "You saw that, did you?""Yes!" Remus threw the scrap of paper at him. "Why did you do that?!"James looked down at his glasses, slowly cleaning the lenses. "The Ministry was having a post-Christmas raffle. I thought the StarShooter would be a great donation, on the condition the profits go to Hogwarts. Did you see it's to be split with the library too? I thought you'd like that.""You got a new broom?!" he demanded, readying his wand again.He perked up, putting his clean glasses back on his face. "Wait till you see it! Oh, it's a beaut, Remus, it—" He stopped as someone pounded at the door. Remus turned and opened it up, still pointing his wand at James."Remus!" Peter squeaked."Peter!" He opened the door fully and the two exchanged hugs then Peter and James hugged."What is... what happened?!" Peter looked down at the globby piles of mucus."Remus attacked me," James replied, and Peter looked up at Remus."I did," he said, tucking his wand away finally. "James, you can clean it. It is your mess."James grumbled as he got some handkerchiefs out and began cleaning the messes up but despite his attempts there were still some streaks of snot on the floor. "Maybe we should get a new compartment," Peter suggested and the others agreed so they gathered their stuff, peeled the sign off the door, then headed down to find an empty compartment before anyone else got on the train. James disappeared to throw the handkerchiefs away, not wanting to keep them which baffled Remus. They were perfectly good handkerchiefs. He would have just wrapped them up in something to clean later… but of course, James didn't really need to worry about that.When Remus turned the radio back on he turned the volume down a bit. "Has anyone seen Sirius?" James asked when he returned."No," both Remus and Peter chorused.Peter got onto one of the seats and looked out the window. Remus and James settled down across from one another; Remus glaring, James far too smug. Remus kicked his ankle very gently and James stuck his tongue out."Oooh, I see Regulus," Peter said, pressing his face against the glass. "There's Sirius! He looks... not pleased."James and Remus scrambled to the window and sure enough Sirius looked absolutely miserable. His arms were folded, his shoulders were hunched, and his lips were turned down in a big time scowl. He kept kicking at the ground and giving small nods as a woman waggled a finger in his face, and Regulus stood off to the side a little, arms rigid at his sides. The woman—obviously their mother—seized Sirius's shoulder and gave him a little shake. Then she let go, turned to Regulus, and started wagging her finger in his face though only for a moment. Then she left without even waiting for them to get on board.The brothers looked at each other then got their bags, headed to the train. Before long there was a knock at the door and James opened it. The misery was long gone from Sirius's face. He was grinning now, accepting James's hug then sidling into the room. Peter gave him a hug, then Remus approached him.He stopped."What's wrong?" Sirius asked, then flinched for some weird reason."N—nothing," Remus whispered then gave him one of the most awkward hugs he had given. Sirius felt awkward, and Remus was awkward because he smelled blood. Sirius had been bleeding at some point that morning. Quite profusely. Where at? Remus didn't see any stains on his clothes anywhere... was that why he flinched?"The Marauders, together again!" James said, pumping his fist in the air."The holidays felt like they lasted forever," Peter sighed, collapsing onto the seat next to Remus. "Grandpa was so grouchy over the whole argument and not going skiing and he says I am definitely going next year, and he kept glaring at my mother, and she never said anything about it, so I think next Christmas I'm going to die. I'm gonna crash into a tree and die." He flung himself back, groaning. "Sirius, you can have my camera and all my photography stuff, and Remus you can have my books, and James I don't know what you'd want but whatever it is you can have it.""I'm sure you won't die," James said, flapping his hand. "Anything you break, Saint Mungo's can fix."Peter gulped, going a bit white. "Ahhh...""It's a year away," Remus reasoned. "I'm sure it will be fine.""A year away from my death," Peter mumbled under his breath."Sirius, you're being very quiet," James noted. Sirius mumbled something under his breath. "What?"Sirius went a bit red. "Don't... feel like it..." he said slowly.Panic took over Remus's body. WHAT WAS CAUSING THE BLEEDING!?"But... I've missed you guys so much," Sirius said, sitting next to James and propping his feet up between Remus and Peter, his long legs stretching across the compartment.James elbowed him, and Sirius winced very slightly, and Remus could hardly breathe. What should he do? Confront Sirius? Demand to know what was hurting, to fix it? Would Sirius get upset if Remus pointed it out? He wasn't talking about his wound, so he probably didn't want anyone to know..."Missed you guys too," James said. "The holidays weren't too bad—""Show us!" Peter squealed. "I want to see your new broom!"Remus clenched his teeth, shooting furious glares at James. "You told them? But... what, forgot to tell me? It slipped your mind?"James gave him a cheeky grin and pulled the carrying case out from the overhead bin. It looked different than the one he had before. "It's amazing, guys." He flipped open the latches and pulled his new broom out. Sirius and Peter both oohed and ahhhhed and Remus tilted his head, as this broom looked like it had silver on it too."It's white-gold," James said, smiling at Remus, offering the broom. Remus stretched his hand out and didn't feel any of the burning sensation that silver gave him. He took hold of the broom, wrapping his hand around the handle, fingers against the white-gold that spelled out the name of the broom. MoonGlide. The handle was jet black and the tail was pure white. In addition to the name and the sections attaching the tail to the handle there was some white-gold near the tip of the handle: a crescent moon."That looks so fancy!" Peter said."They're not out yet, are they?" Sirius asked, taking the broom from Remus.James grinned from ear to ear. "Nope. They come out in spring. And they're supposed to have silver on them too but Baldwin Duskfall—the owner of the MidnightFlight company—made this special for me.""Merlin's beard," Peter breathed out."How'd you convince him to do that?" Sirius asked, raising his eyebrows."I said I liked white-gold more than silver," replied James with a casual shrug. "Actually I asked what different metals they had. Most of their higher end brooms have silver on them because of the whole star... nighttime theme. But when I asked for white-gold instead they were fine with it, no questions asked.""Oh for Merlin's sake," mumbled Remus but nobody really listened to him."You said that you preferred a different metal and he made a custom made broom for you?" snorted Sirius, handing the broom to Peter.James giggled. "Yep! It flies even better than the StarShooter. Wait till you see!" He put the broom back in its case and carefully put it back in the overhead. "I love this broom even more than my old one, so it's all good.""The old one you had for what, six months?" Remus asked rather stiffly."Stop looking like you're sucking on something sour," James said, flopping back into his seat. "I wanted to do this. It's done. It's fine.""It's an incredible bro—" Sirius stopped talking, face going white, hands clapping over his mouth.Remus stared.Peter's jaw dropped.James sat upright."What... did you say?" James asked and Sirius shook his head. "What did you say?!""I heard him!" Peter said."Your voice!" Remus said.Sirius let out a long groan. "Okay fine! You caught me!" His hands now covered his entire face, as it happened again.His voice had broken over the holidays, and Sirius Black was now squeaking."HAH!" James shouted and Sirius parted his fingers enough to glower between them. "Congrats, mate!""Say something else," Peter urged. Sirius shook his head and turned from them, folding his arms."It's not so bad," Remus promised. "We're all going to go through it.""Yeah, you should be proud you're first," James said and Sirius slowly faced them again."It's embarrassing," he said."You didn't squeak that time," Pete said."No," Sirius sighed, "it doesn't always happen." It did that time though, and James tried not to snicker.The other three talked about the broom for a while then they switched to various things that happened over the holiday that they hadn't mentioned in their letters, except for Sirius who didn't talk very much at all about his holidays. Though since his Big Secret was revealed he did become his usual chatty self. Remus thought his quietness had more to do with wanting to hide his squeaky voice than it did... whatever was causing the blood but... he couldn't be sure.Then they decided to exchange their presents, and there was a flurry as they got the presents out from their bags. The others had gifts of various sizes, while Remus's three were identical except for the names on them. He began to grow anxious about the scarves. Maybe they were dumb."I—I want Remus to open mine last," Peter said. He had two small-medium boxes, and then a huge lumpy package."No, he's opening mine last," James argued. "It's so cool.""So's mine!" Peter protested."Can't he open mine last?" Sirius asked.Remus swiveled his head, feeling dizzy. "I—it's—I don't—""He can open all our presents last," James reasoned."But—I'm not—""Let's split them," Peter said, not listening to Remus.Remus shakily gave his three packages out then was given a tiny box from James, a medium box from Sirius, and the huge lumpy package from Peter. What on earth?! he wondered. Why did they want him to open last?! It felt... uncomfortable. He didn't want it to be a big show or anything. Why couldn't he just open them quietly?After much argument they settled on an order, and one by one they opened their presents. Remus wanted to crawl somewhere and hide because they all got each other nice stuff and he just gave him the scarves and sweets, and the scarves didn't even look that great; all three of them insisted they loved the scarves and were excited they matched, and asked if Remus had made himself one to match too."N... no but... I—I can...""You should!" James exclaimed."Now it's your turn," Sirius said, looking very excited.Remus looked down at the packages on his lap. "Wh—which should I open... first?"All three of them looked eager and he knew they all wanted theirs to be last for some reason, so he picked a number, had them guess, and went in the order closest to farthest; ironically biggest to smallest packages, so Peter was first.Remus opened it up, not sure what to expect, and found... a blanket. "Oh, it looks super nice!" He pulled it fully out of the package and lifted it up. "It looks very warm."Peter squirmed, looking ready to burst. "It's special!" he squeaked out then began bouncing in his seat. "It's for—it's for um, it's for you know! Your—um—it's for the moon. Time. Moon time."Remus lowered the blanket, looking puzzled. "What?""My mum made it! She's a seamstress, you know. Real good with sewing magic and fabric spells. I asked her to make a blanket that can withstand a lot of wear and tear!" Peter beamed so bright it looked like it hurt. "You said you get really cold, and that... you know, that um, you tend to tear up blankets. So... hopefully... you won't be able to tear this up. I tested it with all sorts of knives and it didn't rip, it's got some really heavy enchantments on it. I mean, they'll wear off eventually, but... hopefully it lasts a while. I know knives aren't the same as your, um, you know, claws, but—but hopefully it works. And now you can have a blanket to keep you warm. Um, I mean, I hope. If it—if it works." He fell silent and went red.Remus stared at him, then stared at the blanket, then back at Peter, unable to believe his ears, unable to believe what he just heard. He opened his mouth, then shut it. What? What?!"I—I got him something for those times too," Sirius said and Remus jerked, staring wide-eyed at Sirius now."You did? A blanket?" Peter asked, sounding a little sad.Sirius shook his head. "No... errr... well, you'll see."Remus picked up Sirius's present and it slipped from his hands since he was so shaky. James picked it up and handed it back. Remus managed to pull at the paper and then got it open. Inside he found a metal box, about the size of a breadbox."It's... like the blanket, I guess," Sirius mumbled, avoiding Remus's eyes. "You said you don't have any way to read because if you... umm... you know, you'll ruin the book. So I thought..." He took the box from Remus and opened it up, pulling a book out of his own bag. He set the book sort've in the box and opened it. "You can read like this, it's a little weird but... I don't know what it's like for you when you're about to... I mean, if you'll have time, but all you do is..." He let go of the book so it fell in, and shut the box very swiftly. "Like that. It locks automatically—or will, once you've set the password. And you shouldn't be able to get into it. Uncle Alphard said it held up to all sorts of spells and weight. I didn't tell him what it was for just... a box that was indestructible or as close to it as I could get. Of course you can test it first." He took his book back and handed the box back to Remus who was frozen in absolute shock. "If it doesn't hold up, I'll get you something else."Blanket? He couldn't rip? Box? For—books?"Mine's... selfish," James suddenly said and he looked really upset. "Damn it. I'm sorry, Remus. I shouldn't have—I'm sorry."Remus felt a little relieved because if it was something else that would... help him... he'd probably just self destruct and shatter into millions of pieces. He picked up the small present and ripped the paper off to find a small box. He opened it, curious because it really looked like a jewelry box. Inside were two strangely shaped objects attached by a cord which had a thin tube in the middle of the cord. He picked it up. The strangely shaped objects were soft and squashy, and he had no clue what this was."They're... they're earplugs," James muttered, messing his hair up. "I mean... I got them for the—for my games and the parties and stuff but you can use it whenever you're feeling like there's too much noise. They're small and should be able to be hidden under your hair." He got up and sat next to Remus, showing him the thin wooden tube along the cord which was separated into two pieces. "You twist it this way, and it blocks out more sound. This way, less sound. Try them."Remus slowly put the earplugs in with the cord around the back of his head and instantly everything became... not quite muffled... but more quiet. Like someone had turned the volume down, like you would a radio."I think they should be helpful," James said, sounding soft and quiet. "But I mean, I hope they are, but I got them cause I was thinking of the Quidditch games which is super selfish of me, I know, and I'm sorry."Remus reached back and began adjusting the wooden section. The noise grew louder until it was just slightly muted, and then he twisted the other way and the noise lowered until he could hardly hear anything. He couldn't imagine how much they had cost. Didn't want to imagine how much they cost.When James spoke, he could barely hear him so he turned the volume up a wee bit, then he dropped his hands. They were shaking so hard the others could see, and all of them grew concerned. He shook his head when they tried to talk to him and wanted—wanted to just... he didn't know what he wanted to do but he felt so completely overwhelmed, and shocked, and confused. The gifts were—they were for... for him, for the—to help him as a—they were all gifts to aid him as a werewolf.To help him.To make things easier.To make life as a werewolf easier.Remus couldn't see anything. It was all going blurry and swimmy and kinda black around the edges but not from anger, for the first time not from anger. He just—it was too much, it was so much and they were talking, and touching him, and he couldn't bear it another second though he tried—he really tried because he didn't want to seem like a baby, like a dumb, weak, emotional baby—but he couldn't and promptly burst into tears."Remus!"He bent forward, pulling the hem of his jumper up to cover his face as he sobbed.He didn't understand why they'd do this, why they'd just—It wasn't... the gifts were...They were all apologizing, he could hear them saying the words. He even thought he heard Sirius say the rarely used 'S' word but everything was so muffled from the earplugs and his throbbing head he wasn't sure."No," he tried to say. "No, it's f-f-fine, it's fine, it's—it's okay—" But he couldn't handle it anymore, couldn't stand them fussing over him like this, couldn't have them seeing him like this and he got to his feet, swaying from dizziness. "I—I'll be—r-r-right back—fine, I'm fine—promise—it's okay—presents are fine—"He staggered out of the compartment and ran to the nearest loo, locking himself in one of the stalls to cry in private. He had... never gotten anything like it before. His parents never gave him gifts to make his life better as a werewolf. They didn't even like listening to his complaints as a werewolf. If he tried, they shut him down. They wanted to know some things of course but not the details. Whereas... the Marauders listened to what he said and heard some of his complaints and specifically sought out gifts to help him!To help him. As a werewolf. To help some of the troubles he had due to being a werewolf and they helped him and just did that!?The door flung open and his friends clattered in, their voices very muted since Remus still had the earplugs in."Remus?""We're so sorry!""We didn't mean to upset you—""I'm sorry about the blanket, I just thought—""I'll take the earplugs back—""I just know you love to read and figured—"They stood in front of the stall, crowded at the door but not opening or trying to get in."No," Remus sniffled, burying his face in his hands. "S'not—not that—it's—no I l-l-love them—"Silence."Then why are you crying?" Peter asked gently.Remus sniffled loudly, wiping some snot off on his sleeve. How was he supposed to explain this? That—that it felt bizarre and unnatural to him that they weren't brushing his lycanthropy under the rug, pretending that it didn't exist unless it was being shoved in their faces? How much it meant to him—more than he could ever be able to say—that they had actually listened to his problems and wanted to help."You d-d-didn't... t-talk about—talk—talk about the—the g-gifts w-with each other?" he asked. "It w-wasn't a—a planned thing?"Sirius's feet moved and then his knees appeared below the door, and then his face, head tilted upside down so he could look in the stall. "No, I had no idea they were doing anything like that. It was incredibly insensitive of us, I see that now—""No." Remus shook his head, wiping more snot and tears off. "How is it ins-sen-insens—insens—""Because... we should have gotten you gifts for you, not to... not gifts for... that," Sirius squeaked out, frowning.It is me though. Remus pushed himself to his feet and opened the door, knowing how terrible his face looked. "I love the gifts," he whispered."You seem so upset though," James said."N... not upset... over—overwhelmed," he admitted, ducking his head as he pulled the earplugs out and everything sounded crisper and louder, but not painfully loud. "My parents... never... d-d-did anything l-like that f—for me. I mean." He tugged at his sleeve, not wanting to sound dumb but not knowing how to say it. "You—you got me—presents to—you're not ignoring—you're not—" But everything was twisted up in his mind so of course the words were being twisted on his tongue. "I love them," he finally settled on repeating. "Th—they're perfect.""You're... sure?" Peter asked hesitantly.Remus took in a deep breath and slowly managed to get out, "They're... the best presents... I've ever gotten."All three of them looked immensely pleased."Naww, it's not... you don't mean that," James said, sounding rather hopeful."It's true." He looked down at the earplugs. "All of them. They're... they mean a lot. They're... very... thoughtful." There it was, the right word. "You p-p-put so much thought into these gifts and—so meaningful—and they're for me and to help and—you—you t-took into—into consideration wh-what I might n-need and—they're perfect."Then he hugged James. He didn't think about it, didn't think about how hard it was for him to initiate a hug when it wasn't a long-time-no-see greeting. But he hugged James, putting a little bit of a tightness to the hug but not too much. Then he hugged Peter, and then Sirius (who still seemed awkward, so he didn't prolong that hug too much)."Thank you," he sniffled, wiping his face one more time.Sirius tousled his hair and Remus gave a wane smile before going to wash his face off. Then the four returned to their compartment where Remus carefully folded the blanket up, examined the box, and toyed with the earplug settings for a while, and tried his hardest not to start crying again.He was very quiet for most of the rest of the trip. He joined in the conversations as well as the various games they played but overall was subdued. Every time he thought of the presents he grew emotional.Sometime in the late afternoon Lily showed up so Remus gave her his present and thanked her for the book. They talked in the corridor for a bit (both of them studiously avoiding the contents of Lily's letter) then Remus fetched his present for Aegis and went searching for him. He really didn't want to be around people right now, but wanted to go ahead and give him the small gift. He found Aegis in a compartment with Bones and Pierce, actually, which made Remus a little happy to see him hanging out with other people. All three of them greeted Remus cheerfully and asked about his holidays. They talked for a few minutes (in which Remus felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to run off) until he managed to get Aegis out into the corridor."Um. I—I wasn't... sure if we—if you—errrr... It's not much." Remus handed him the gift which was a dozen homemade biscuits he and Hope had baked the night before.He looked startled and Remus suddenly felt completely worried he'd feel the need to give Remus something back. But then he disappeared into the compartment and brought a small gift back out, handing it over."I wasn't sure either," Aegis said with an embarrassed smile. "It's not much, too."They opened their presents and Remus a small chocolate shaped like the Gryffindor emblem, and a bottle of ink."Thank you!" Remus said, smiling."Thank you. Did—did you make these yourself?""Y-yes...""That is such a kind gift, thank you," Aegis said, opening the bag and sniffing. "They smell delicious.""I hope you like them. They're just sugar since I wasn't sure if you'd like anything else...""I really enjoy sugar biscuits," Aegis promised.They chattered for a couple minutes then Remus headed back to the compartment with the other Marauders. Of course they wanted to know where he had been so Remus showed them the present from Aegis. James and Peter thought it was nice while Sirius frowned."Did you get him something?" Sirius asked, trying not to sound too curious.Remus put the chocolate and ink away in his bag then squished himself into the corner of the seat with a book. His ability to talk with other people—including the Marauders—was at its breaking point. "Biscuits," he replied, pulling his feet up onto the seat. "I'm just going to read for a while, if that's okay."None of them minded and he put the earplugs in, blocking out a good amount of the sound. He could still hear the music and their talking but it was at a very, very low level, and made him feel included without being included. He buried his nose in the book, and read for most the rest of the trip.

Author's Note: brief internalized homophobia in this chapter/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\It felt a little strange and new to Remus as they got off the train and piled into carriages; he realized it was probably because the year before he hadn't had this experience: coming back to the school after the Christmas holidays. Everyone seemed to be in a very bright mood, and Sirius's mood certainly seemed to get better. He spent the entire trip fogging up the windows and drawing penises."Home!" he exclaimed (rather squeakily) as soon as the castle came into view.The four of them tumbled out into the slush, joining the throng heading to the castle. Several Gryffindors shouted out greetings to James who shouted greetings back; ever since his first game he had gotten more popular. The castle still had some of its Christmas decorations up which lent a nice air to the Great Hall, and cheered Remus. Dumbledore gave a typical welcome-back speech then food appeared across the tables."We should have prepared something for this meal," sighed James. "Fireworks, or something.""I bet this term we're going to have so many good pranks!" giggled Peter."Yeah, last year we pulled our best prank during the spring term," agreed James, referring to the Bat-Bogey hex that had landed them in the Daily Prophet. Not that anyone knew they had done it of course. "We need to outdo ourselves this year.""I have a few ideas," Remus said quietly, but they all turned expectant looks to him. "I—er, jotted a few prank ideas down over the holidays, is all I meant. And some ideas to... work on figuring out... how to do them." He thought of one prank in particular that he needed to figure out how to do. As far as he knew there wasn't any spell for it already but he'd have to do research, and if that didn't pan out that meant coming up with his own spell again."I have some ideas too," Sirius said. "Actually, Pete gave me the ideas.""I did?" Peter asked incredulously.Sirius grinned. "Your letters did, about breaking legs—""We are not breaking anyone's legs!" Remus said swiftly, shutting that idea down."Whose legs did you want to break?" James inquired."I wasn't planning on breaking anyone's legs!" Sirius protested. "Though, there are some Slytherins who deserve it. No, I was thinking about the whole skiing thing. We should try to make some of the stairwells into like... slopes of snow. To go sledding inside. It's not really a prank but...""Oh that sounds like fun!" laughed James, clapping his hands."Are we bringing the snow in or...?" Peter asked."Dunno, it depends I guess." Sirius turned to Remus but then averted his eyes as if he didn't want to look at Remus which sent a weird feeling through him. Had he done something to upset him? "Is there a spell to make it snow inside—""We should make it snow in the Great Hall!" James gasped out."Like it is now?" Remus asked, raising an eyebrow.James looked up to the ceiling. There were snowflakes drifting down but they were just illusions and disappeared several feet above everyone's heads. "No, I mean real snow.""I'm sure there is..." Remus pulled his notebook out of this satchel and flipped it open to the second half. Indoor Snow."What's that?" Pete asked.Remus snapped the notebook shut and turned it around so they could see the front. "One of my Christmas presents. I'm writing some of my ideas down as well as some of the things I need to research. Oh! Speaking of research..." he opened the book again, flipping back to that section. "There are some in here that I wasn't sure if you wanted me to look into. Like the spell to make... er... flatulence sounds when one sits down—""Farting," James snickered.Remus rolled his eyes. "Yes.""Of course! It'll be great to do to Snivellus," Sirius said and James nodded.Remus went down the list and of course every single one they wanted him to look into, even the ones they had completely forgotten about which was almost all of them. He put his notebook away and returned to his food, definitely ready to eat. He really hadn't eaten much while at home and suspected he had lost a little bit of weight and he wanted to make sure to put it back on before Pomfrey found out. He didn't want to deal with that again; of course he hadn't lost anywhere near the same amount that he had in October.The four of them discussed the idea of transporting snow inside to cover a stairwell, and which stairwell would be best. They all agreed the main one would be not only the best but technically the easiest being so close to the main doors and therefore not have to haul the snow too far. However… they'd pretty much be caught immediately. Remus suggested they take the snow to a secret corridor and enchant it to stay cold until they had enough to cover a stairwell."You know how to keep it cold?" James asked."Errrr... n... no, but it shouldn't be too difficult." Remus got the notebook out again. Keep snow cold."That's going to be filled up before Easter," Peter said."Hopefully it lasts plenty long." Remus put it back in the bag and returned to his food. Once dessert appeared he piled various sweets onto his plate. "I think I'll go to the library—""It's our first night back!" James protested."It won't be for long. Curfew will be over very soon, I just want to check out a book for the snow-related spells," said Remus, shoveling cake into his mouth."Is it even open tonight?" Peter wondered.Remus glanced up at the table and saw Mr. Farrow there. "Oh. Maybe—maybe not. I guess it'll have to wait till tomorrow...""Sirius, you've been pretty quiet tonight, is everything okay?" James asked, voicing the question Remus had been wanting to ask.Sirius jumped a little then smiled. "Yeah, I'm fine. Glad to be home. I guess I'm a little tired. Anyway, I agree with—with Remus. Hiding the snow somewhere till we have everything will probably work out the best.""Which means figuring out which secret passage and still which stairwell," James said then he began going through some ideas. Sirius nodded, adding a bit of input, but there was definitely something off about him.Remus thought again of the blood, and then the train ride realizing Sirius had been kinda quiet then too. He had initially thought it was the whole voice changing thing, but... what if it wasn't? Remus lowered his fork, studying Sirius. Is he okay? Does he need to... see Pomfrey? His chest hurt at that last thought, sick at the idea that he'd need to do that. He wanted to say something however had the feeling Sirius would just dismiss it... but he had to try..."Hey, um, S—Sirius?""Yeah?" he asked, focusing on his food, noticeably not looking at Remus.Remus squirmed a little. "You sure you're all right? If you're not f-feeling well perhaps you should go see Madame Pom—"Sirius's head snapped up at that, irritation blazing in his eyes. "No," he said then gave a slight hiss and forced a smile on his face. "I'm fine, just tired. I promise. If anyone should see Pomfrey it's you. You've lost weight.""I have not.""Have so."Remus and Sirius glared at one another then James tried to broach the subject, and Sirius quickly switched it back to the snow stuff, making it very obvious he didn't want to discuss his health any further. Peter was eyeing him with a worried look, James frowned, and Remus shifted a little bit."Bloody hell," Sirius groaned, smacking the table. "I'm fine, okay? If you lot are going to act like hens, I'm off."James and Peter both apologized and returned to the snow stuff, and Sirius began relaxing again, smiling again. Remus remained absolutely silent, frustrated with both Sirius and himself. If Sirius really was hurting... but he made it clear he wanted it dropped. What should I do? He looked down at the remainder of his dessert, no longer hungry. He pushed the plate away and wiped his mouth off. Ugh, the day had been such a wild ride. Happiness from the reunion, emotion from the presents, joy at being at Hogwarts again, and now this./\/\/\/\/\The four of them stayed up very late that night and slept in till nearly noon the next day. Actually the only reason they got up was because Litten came in and woke James up."Bell's been on a rampage about your broom," he said when James sat up. Sirius (no spells on the curtains) and Remus (superior hearing) both woke up too, but Peter (spells on curtains) remained asleep. "She says you got rid of it over the holiday?""Awwww hippogriffs, I forgot to write to her," James mumbled, reaching out for his glasses. "Yeah, I got a new broom.""The StarShooter was new," Litten pointed out."Yeah but I didn't like it, I was having trouble with it anyway," yawned James. "I have a MoonGlide now.""A—" Litten's arms dropped to his sides, shock filling his face. "A what?!""MoonGlide," James repeated casually, stretching a bit."Those don't come out for—""I know. My dad's friends with Mr. Duskfall. I got one."Litten goggled at James. "Damn! That's—wow. Wow. Bell is going to flip out when she hears that. Um... I have the feeling expect an emergency team meeting to show off that new broom of yours, Potter. MoonGlide...!" Litten whirled around and hurried out of the dorm.James began laughing almost as soon as the door shut. "His face! Oh that was brilliant! HEY PETER!" He hopped out of bed and ran over, yanking Peter's curtains aside and jumping onto him. "Wake up! Come on, then, it's morning!"The four of them got dressed and went down to an early lunch where almost right away Bell ran towards James wanting to know if Litten was pulling her leg. James promised he wasn't, and sure enough Bell called an emergency meeting at one then hurried off to let the other members know."Can we come too?" Peter asked. "I want to see you flying.""Of course! All of you come."Once they finished eating they returned to the dorms to hang out a bit before throwing on jackets, scarves, and hats, then James grabbed his carrying case and the four headed out to the pitch, reaching it at about five till; the entire team was there, alogn with the two reserves... which included Kirke who wore a scowl on his face."Okay, Potter, let's see it," Bell said, staring at the black carrying case.James set it down in the snow then flicked the latches, pulling the MoonGlide out. The entire team gasped. Bell took a few steps closer, hand lifting. James held it out so she could hold it. She examined it closer then shook her head, handing it back to him."I can't believe it.""Let's see it in action!" cheered on Maureen Charmer, clapping her hands.James mounted the MoonGlide and everyone backed up, giving him plenty of room. He kicked off, smoothly rising into the air. "It's faster than the StarShooter, and has better turning too!" he said and then took off.The next half an hour was spent watching James do various tricks as well as letting Sirius have a go too. He offered to let Peter and Remus try but they shook their heads. Peter was too nervous about flying on such an expensive broom that wasn't even out yet, and Remus—well, he didn't like flying.But it was getting pretty cold so Bell disbanded the impromptu meeting, saying she'd see everyone Tuesday evening. The team headed out, all of them stopping to congratulate James... except for Kim, who pulled Sirius aside to whisper to him, chatting to him about their holidays which piqued Remus's curiosity (Did the dance... spark something...?), and Kirke who stopped right in front of James."Congratulations on the new broom, Potter," he sneered, "can't wait to see what broom you get next that keeps you on the team.""My talent is what keeps me on the team, Kirke," James said stiffly back. "Whether it's on a MoonGlide, a StarShooter, or a Cleansweep One! I could out-chase you anytime."Sirius butted into the conversation, holding up a finger in exclamation. "Which he did! At tryouts."Kirke's face went red and he stomped off, muttering about spoiled brats under his breath. Sirius gave him a rude gesture then turned back around as Kim came over, saying she'd see him later."You need to talk to Bell or McGonsie about that prat," Sirius grumbled after Kim walked off."No, I said before... I don't want to risk anything," James said, putting his broom away. "What were you and Kim talking about?""Eh, she was just telling me about her holidays," Sirius said, not seeming too interested in talking about her. "Kirke deserves something happening to him. At least let me do something! I'll do it publicly too, so everyone knows it was me and that you had nothing to do with it.""You two are pretty much twins," Peter said, folding his arms. "I don't think anyone would believe that."James stood up, grinning. "He's got a point. Kim didn't tell me what she did over her holidays."Sirius flapped his hand as they began walking towards the entrance to the pitch. "I'll make sure everyone knows it was completely, wholly, utterly my idea and my idea alone.""She said she'd see you later," James said."Okay, are we talking about Kirke or Seo-Yun because—""Seo-Yun!" James shrieked."First name basis?!" Peter gasped out."When did that happen?" James demanded, walking backwards so he could face Sirius. "You weren't calling her that after the dance!"Remus felt a spike of nausea and something sharp deep within him.Sirius huffed, rolling his eyes. "We... wrote over the holidays, a bit.""So, you already knew how her holidays went," said James slowly then he yelped as he tripped and went sprawling in the snow."We didn't talk about the holidays, and you deserved that," Sirius spat out.Peter helped James up, brushing the snow off him. "What did you talk about—""Could we maybe focus on the whole Kirke-is-an-arse thing?" Sirius demanded."Orrrrr we could focus on the-girl-you-took-to-the-dance-is-now-on-first-name-basis-with-you," James said smugly. "She's one of the youngest in her year, you're hardly a year apart..."Sirius narrowed his eyes then got out his wand. "Rosodorus!"James ducked and then went running as Sirius chased him, shooting out spells till he got one to stick, and James dropped his case, sneezing rose petals out quite violently; they fluttered down into the snow, looking like blood against the white.Sirius nodded then turned to Remus. "You're with me on getting Kirke, right?"Remus hesitated, feeling sicker and sicker. Seo-Yun. "Um. Y—yeah, we can do that.""Good!" Sirius punched his arm lightly. "We can come up with some good revenge, maybe get him over next weekend or something. Nothing too bad, I don't want tons of detention since I have to take the blame squarely on my shoulders... but something good..."Remus looked down at his boots, carefully stepping through the snow. James gave his broom case to Sirius and hurried off to the castle to get his sneezing problem fixed, and Peter went with him... leaving Remus alone with Sirius, which wasn't something he wanted. He kept his hands deep in his pockets and tried not to think too hard on the whole name thing."—mus? Oi! Remy!"He jumped, blinking up at him. "Eh?""I said, what do you think of making him bald?" Sirius asked. "It's pretty easily fixed and it'd be funny.""Oh. Uh, yeah.""There's a spell for that, right? I mean, I know there's a potion but that might be difficult... unless we throw balloons at him. You know, that's probably the best thing any of us came up with, using balloons to splash potion on people..."Sirius started talking again and Remus tuned him out, hating himself for being... jealous. It was stupid! Sirius could talk to Kim, be on a first name basis with her, it was fine, it wasn't anything to be worried about, and even if they had interest in one another it didn't really matter, just like Sirius's interest in..."How's Inkwood?" Remus blurted out.Sirius stopped, looking confused. "Er, good... I guess? I haven't seen her today. Why? Did something happen?""No. I just... I mean, Lily said Inkwood sent you something?""Oh!" Sirius flushed a little bit. "Yeah. She sent me a Christmas present." He held up his hands. "These." He wriggled his fingers, indicating the dark red gloves. "And some coconut ice. I wasn't expecting anything from her, so I got her something over the holidays. I'll give it to her tonight. I wonder if we're going to have a New Years, I mean. It's a school night but... how often are we all here at the school for New Years? Usually we're not, for the holidays and all."And off Sirius went about a possible party as they went into the school. Did Sirius like Inkwood then? Or Kim? Could he like both? Or maybe it was just friendship with Kim. Remus of all people knew a boy and a girl could be friends without any romantic interest. Was he just doing the exact same thing he hated them doing by assuming Sirius and Kim were interested in one another?"By the way—"Sirius stopped and Remus ran into him."The scarf is very warm," he said."Oh—""And it matches the hat perfectly." Sirius reached up, adjusting that birthday hat."I'm glad you like it.""Now, you need a matching scarf," he teased, elbowing Remus who nodded, deciding to just push all thoughts of Kim or Inkwood out of his head because really... it didn't matter. Sirius deserved to be happy and if one of them made him happy that was great. It's not like—Well."About the pranking for Kirke, I was thinking we could go another route," Remus said quickly, shoving his hands back in his pockets as they walked through the school. "We could do it in a way that doesn't get you in trouble. James will probably get detention soon, and if we mess with Kirke when James is in detention—so long as he stays in detention—then that will keep his name in the clear..."/\/\/\/\/\That evening when Remus went into the Great Hall he glanced up at the High Table and then came to a stop. Professor Prewett was sitting there, chatting with Professor Sprout, and it made Remus realize Prewett hadn't been around for feast the night before, or the meals today.And there was something different about him."Remus?" Peter gave Remus a nudge and he stumbled, shaking his head. He gave a few furtive glances towards Professor Prewett as he headed to the Gryffindor table.What was different? Remus put some food on his plate but mostly kept his eye on Prewett. He looked the same. Just... more. For instance, his smile seemed a lot brighter and more interesting. Whatever was going on with him made Remus feel extremely fluttery and strange inside. Very similar to his thoughts about Sirius...Oh no, he realized, panic bubbling up. Am I having... Bad Thoughts about Professor Prewett?! Of course... if he was... it wouldn't be too bizarre since Prewett was considered very attractive, so it'd be the same thing like the wrong feelings towards Sirius: just because they were naturally attractive people, that was all.Remus looked down at his food, sending fervent prayers that this wasn't the case because he did not want to deal with having his teacher make him feel this way too!Then when supper was almost done, Dumbledore made an announcement saying clearly that as it was a school night he didn't want anyone staying up too late but if they did stay up till midnight to please go to bed after celebrating the new year. The Gryffindors took that to mean a party which Remus wasn't going to attend until he realized he could, with the ear plugs.James, Sirius, and Peter all got dressed in slightly nicer clothes than they had been wearing during the day and Remus put the earplugs in, fluffing out his hair so it covered the plugs and the cord. He asked if any of it could be seen and James shook his head. Remus smiled, excited to at least test the earplugs out. Even if he didn't stay—which he wasn't sure if he would or not, he really wasn't too sure about parties—if he could nullify the noise that would definitely help."Aren't you gonna change?" Peter asked, noticing Remus was in the same ancient jeans and too-big jumper."I'm fine..." It wasn't as if it was a fancy dance or anything, right? They gave him odd looks but didn't press the issue, and the four of them went downstairs. The music was loud but not as loud as it was when Gryffindor celebrated beating Hufflepuff. It seemed like every single Gryffindor was in the common room; it was crowded, hot, and... not overly loud. It was loud in its own way, but dulled to the point where it just kinda felt like a normal day in the Great Hall."How's it working?" James asked, leaning in very close so Remus could hear."It's great!" he said, half wanting to just kiss James for such an incredible present and, on that thought, he braced himself for the quivery feeling that usually happened when he thought of kissing Sirius and when James had said the kissing thing before. But while there was a fluttery sensation in his stomach, it wasn't anywhere near as bad. Which definitely proved he wasn't a freak, and he'd like girls eventually.Remus still stayed at the edges, sitting in an armchair with a cup of punch someone provided. He sniffed at it to make sure it was only punch then took a sip, watching everyone else, pretty much all of whom wore party hats. James and Peter were dancing together, arms and elbows flying every which way, and Sirius was talking to Inkwood, both of them laughing. Lily was sitting on the back of the armchair Colgate sat in, the two of them talking.Remus took another sip and settled back. The fact there were so many people in the room made his skin crawl, and an uncomfortable feeling filled his whole body but at least he didn't have the added worry of very loud noise digging into him. He reached back around, twisting slightly, dropping the noise a teensy bit more. Not too much, since he wanted to hear his friends talking to him without them having to yell.The other Marauders kept coming back to Remus to hang out (forcing a hat on him), and Lily came over too and they talked. Lily didn't seem to notice the earplugs at all. Then a prefect stood up on a table, whistling loudly and announcing it was nearly midnight.Everyone watched the clock eagerly. "Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! HAPPY NEW YEAR!"Remus flinched as everyone shrieked and laughed and set off poppers and someone set off fireworks which made Remus realize both James and Sirius weren't around, and then everyone began singing."Should auld acquaintances be forgot and never brought to mind... should auld acquaintances be forgot and days of auld lang syne?"Peter slung an arm around Remus, singing loudly. Remus sang softly with him and then James popped up out of nowhere, putting his arms around both their shoulders and joining in with the singing. Once the song finished there was more cheering and laughter, and James squeezed Remus and Peter close."Where's Sirius?" Peter shouted.Then Sirius was there as if he had heard his name, very flushed. "Happy New Years!" he said and James gave him a hug.Lily came over to give Remus a hug too. "This is great, being able to celebrate here!" she said, eyes shining with excitement."Yeah well—" James started and Lily raised her eyebrows. James frowned then gave a grunt. "Happy New Years, Red.""Happy New Years, Potter," she replied with a grin then headed back to Colgate and Inkwood.Sirius staggered back, clutching his chest. "You were nice to her!" he moaned out, falling into a chair and pretending to die. "Remus! Did you kiss her at midnight?""What!?" Remus shrieked, voice rising to the point of squeakiness, rivaling Sirius's broken tones. His friends burst into laughter. "Sh—shut up! No! Of course not! Ew!""I cannot believe it's 1973 already!" Peter said, and the four moved to the stairs to head back up to their dorm; it seemed people were still hanging out but they didn't feel like doing much more. "I'll be thirteen in less than a month.""Think your cock'll get bigger?" James whispered, and Peter and Remus burst into laughter while Sirius whirled around, pretending like he was going to push James down the stairs."Traitor!" Sirius snarled out. "I'm going to kill you!" Unfortunately his voice peaked very high on 'kill' and his friends just began laughing again. Sirius went beet red and stormed up the rest of the stairs."Sorry! Siri!" James chased after him, apologizing. "Come on, I'm sorry!"By the time Peter and Remus got to the dorm they had already made up. The four went their separate ways to change into pajamas (James openly in the dorm, Sirius hidden behind his curtains, Peter and Remus in the bathroom), said their goodnights, all of them apologized once more to Sirius, then they went to bed.Remus tossed and turned a while, very sleepy, but having some trouble getting to sleep. He heard rustling and then Sirius getting into James's bed, James apologizing again, and Sirius promising he wasn't upset, it was kinda funny, he was just really embarrassed about his voice, but Inkwood didn't seem to mind.Remus froze, his breath catching in his throat, as Sirius excitedly whispered to James."Sooooo... I guess I got my first kiss.""What?!" James yelped quietly. "You... kissed? You kissed?!""Cassie. Yeah, at midnight, that's where I was."Remus closed his eyes, curling onto his side, not wanting to hear this. They knew he had good hearing! Why were they doing this? All right, so they probably didn't realize he could hear through both sets of spelled curtains but still..."I was setting off the rockets—""Yeah, uhh..."James laughed. "What was it like?""I don't know. Weird. It was a bit quick. I wasn't sure until it actually happened if it was gonna happen. Then she giggled and ran off. But she didn't seem annoyed or anything so I guess she liked it.""Did you like it?"Remus held his breath."Yeah, I'd like to kiss her again. Her lips are really soft. She tasted like fruit.""Fruit?""Yeah," Sirius chuckled. "You know, from the punch."Remus swallowed and then sat up, wanting to go over there, almost going over there, but..."Will you kiss her again?""I hope so! I think so, she seemed like she wanted to, at least."He slid out of bed, opening his desk drawer to get out the earplugs. After putting them in and turning them down, he couldn't hear the boys anymore. He'd tell them eventually he could hear them, but he didn't want to intrude on a personal conversation and embarrass them.Feeling sick, he hugged Gwyllgi tightly to his chest, shoving his ridiculous and weird and unnecessarily bitter feelings under the box as he tried to go to sleep.

Remus woke up when his alarm went off and just stared at the canopy above him. He reached through the curtains to turn the buzzing off then yawned, rolled over, and listened to everyone else getting out of bed. Peter's slow, tired, don't-want-to-be-up movements, Sirius automatically getting out of bed as if he was being forced, and James bouncing completely out of bed and making loud noises as he happily got ready for the day.Remus didn't want to go to class. He just wanted to stay in bed all day. He buried his head under the pillow and wished he could make some sort of excuse...His curtains opened. "Come on, up and at'em," James said, shaking Remus. "It's getting late."Remus sat up, blinking at the clock. He must have fallen back asleep because nearly half an hour passed. He mumbled a thanks and dove for the bathrooms to get the quickest shower possible and throw on his uniform. He should have prepared his satchel for the day the previous night (like he usually did) but the party had been such a distraction. He shoved his Potions and Charms stuff in and decided to come back up at lunchtime for the rest of it."Remus..." Sirius said as soon as he tried to follow them into the hall. Remus looked up at him, wondering if Sirius was going to say something about the kiss; he did not want to hear about it. "Your jumper is inside out."Remus looked down, flushed a bit, then ducked back into the dorm to get it turned the right way 'round. They all headed down to breakfast then off to Potions where the smells were horrendous and he wanted to throw up. What was worse was Slughorn decided to pair everyone up, and James, Sirius, Peter, and Lily were all paired off pretty quickly and he was terrified he'd be put with Snape again but instead he was put with Magpie.He felt relief as she came over to join him. "Hey," she said with a shy smile."H—hi," he replied, getting his Potions book out.Before they started, Slughorn gave everyone their test results back. Remus beamed at his E! As always, your theoretical work is incredible; if you could make potions as well as you know about them you could easily become a potions master. He hoped he hadn't dragged Aegis's grade down."I got an E," Magpie whispered. "How about you?""S—same.""Congratulations!" she said brightly. "I heard you weren't too good in this class, but I couldn't believe it because you're so smart..."Remus tucked the paper away, shaking his head. "I'm n-n-not. Not with... m—making them at l-least..."The potion they were working on wasn't too arduous; they put in most of the ingredients and then it had to simmer for nearly the entire class, but then Slughorn had them work on prepping other ingredients for practice. Some of the ingredients they were working on were particularly horrible, and he had a very hard time doing anything. Finally, he pulled the collar of his jumper up over his nose though that didn't provide much help. Magpie was curious but didn't say anything about it.Just before it was time to take the potion off the fire...KABOOOOOM!There were shrieks, and Remus cried out from the noise, covering his ears. But it was his potion that exploded, sending a shower of potion all over him and he felt stinging on his face, and Magpie was drenched—her screams slamming into his ears—and he immediately thought Oh no I did it wrong I seriously screwed up! But then he noticed other potions exploding too, and he wondered for a split-second if something had gone seriously wrong with the cauldrons or something when suddenly his head felt strange and woozy. They were working on a sleeping draught which was supposed to be drunk in order to put people to sleep but it hadn't been finished and—And everything went black./\/\/\/\/\Remus moaned, wallowing back and forth before slowly sitting up. He rubbed his pounding head, and then looked around in confusion. He was in the hospital wing, in a bed in the open area. To his left he saw Sirius! To his right there was Magpie, and beyond her Peter. He looked around and saw James was on the other side of the hospital wing."S—Sirius?" Remus tumbled out of bed and staggered over, shaking his friend. His eyes were closed and his skin paler than normal. "Sirius!" He shook him once more then backed up turning and hurrying to Peter. "Petey!" He shook him hard, with no response. "Peter, wake up!" Then he went to James's side, shaking him desperately now. "James? Please?""Mr. Lupin!" Madame Pomfrey emerged from her office, hearing his panicking voice. "You're awake.""Awake?" he asked, hands still on James's shoulders, confused."You were asleep," she explained then nodded at the other students. "All of them are as well. There was an incident in Potions class, many of you were put under the effects of a sleeping draught."He pulled away from James, pressing his fingers against his temples as he tried to fight the wooziness off. "You're s-s-supposed to drink it," he muttered, remembering the explosions."Yes, when it's properly made, but most of these were in various states of being unfinished, plus it got in your eyes, nose, mouth, and so on.""How c-come I'm awake and nobody else—" But he stopped, already knowing the answer. Werewolf. Potions didn't affect him the same way it did others. "Are they g-going to be okay?""Well... most of you had burns on your faces from the hot liquid, but those were easily healed; none of them were too terrible since the potions were simmering and not boiling, thank Merlin. Other than that, everyone's merely sound asleep," she promised. "Do you remember what happened?""N... no. Just explosions. Loud noise. Um, then potion going all over me..."Pomfrey gave a sigh. "Some students decided to throw rockets into cauldrons." Remus frowned, immediately thinking of James and Sirius. "Not them—" Pomfrey began but Remus heard someone in the corridor and he thought it would be a mistake to be awake when nobody else was. He hurried to his bed and hopped back in, yanking the covers up just as the doors opened."Madame Pomfrey!" he heard Lily exclaim. "Have they awoke yet?"There was a slight pause and then, "Not yet.""Oh. May I stay? I've finished lunch."Lunch? Remus thought wildly. What time was it?! He heard Lily approaching his bed and she bent over him, whispering his name."I know she said you weren't awake yet but..." He heard her sit down and then felt a hand on his arm. "I'm so worried. Professor McGonagall and Pomfrey both say you guys will be okay but the explosions were so big and all of you looked horrible." Then she sighed. "Not that you can hear me."She stayed by his side for another minute or two then he went to what he suspected was Colgate's bed, who was on the other side of Sirius. He had no idea how long he would have to pretend to be asleep. What if the others didn't wake up for another day? Was he supposed to fake it for an entire night and day? What if it took a week!?Eventually Lily left, and then the clock struck one, and Remus wondered where Lily went since they didn't have class till two. Pomfrey soon came over, shutting the curtains around his bed. "Are you hungry?" she asked.He sat up as she set a tray across his lap. "Are they really going to be okay?" he asked."Of course.""It's been nearly three hours... the sleeping draught—what about the antidote? Have you tried the antidote?"Pomfrey smoothed her apron down. "Yes. However since the potions were not finished, it didn't work. Whatever happened it isn't quite the sleeping draught. Horace is looking into possible fixes however we all have full confidence everyone will awake on their own."Remus finished eating and then sat up reading with the privacy of the curtains preventing anyone else from seeing. He knew Pomfrey shut other curtains so he wasn't the only bed hidden, which made it less suspicious. Shortly before two Professor McGonagall showed up and he heard her and Pomfrey talking, and his name was mentioned, and then McGonagall came over to his bed."Hullo P-Professor," he said, setting his book down."You're awake," she said, sounding rather relieved as she sat down."Yes. I—potions d-don't really affect me the s-same way they do others. Usually I recover quickly from their... er, affects."McGonagall gave a nod. "And you're feeling well otherwise?""Just worried. What happened?""It seems Misters Mulciber and Avery thought it would be funny to throw rockets into several cauldrons," she said.Remus frowned, figuring he knew exactly whose cauldrons had been exploded. "Four cauldrons?"McGonagall adjusted her glasses. "Yes," she admitted. "Yours, and your friends.""I thought I saw some Slytherins in beds...""Yes, they were splashed from Mr. Pettigrew's potion, it was a particularly large explosion."Remus squirmed a bit, wanting to ask again if they'd be okay, wanting more reassurance, wanting to know his best friends wouldn't sleep for days or weeks or months. He tried to convince himself his own recovery meant they would too... however it really didn't. After all, he could be stabbed repeatedly in the stomach and be fine without any aid, whereas they couldn't."Do you have any idea of why they would do this?" McGonagall asked.Remus bit his bottom lip. Yes. Of course he knew why. Everything that happened for the final Potions exam before Christmas. Mulciber and Avery had threatened revenge, and now they got it. But... he wasn't sure if he could admit all this without getting his friends in trouble for sort've (in a way) switching potions twice. "They d-don't like us," is what he settled on saying."Your... friends... haven't done anything to them since your return on Saturday?"Remus shook his head. "No, Professor," he said, grateful he could be honest about that."Thank you for your help.""If—what if they don't wake up for a long time?" he asked as she stood up. "I mean, what—what do I do? It would be very weird if I was awake and none of them were, and we can't say I was splashed less because of—of Magpie. I mean. I—I'm willing to stay in here of course and pretend but...""If you're willing to stay in here for the rest of the afternoon I will think about what to do and get back to you tonight," she said. "If you wish to go to classes...""I can stay here," he said, though he was bitter about missing classes. He had missed Charms. History wasn't too bad to miss since everything was always right out of the book, but missing Transfiguration was awful."I'll see you later, Mr. Lupin."He was left alone to his book and his worries. An entire hour passed before he heard anything in the room. Sounds of someone waking up. He looked up eagerly, listening as Pomfrey came out. It was the two Slytherins who had only been lightly splashed. They were awake now, confused about what happened. They immediately blamed James and Sirius though fell silent when Pomfrey explained it had been Mulciber and Avery."Those twats," muttered the girl.The Slytherins left and Remus very happily went back to his book. He felt loads better now. If they—normal humans—recovered that meant his friends would recover too. They were still asleep by the time supper rolled around and McGonagall came to see him again. She was pleased at the fact the Slytherins had woken up, and Remus said he was fine pretending until the other Gryffindors woke up.Lily came to visit again (and he pretended to be asleep) and then finally after so long he heard the other Gryffindors waking up. Struthers was the first, followed very shortly by James; they had been partners. Remus figured he'd have to wait for Magpie to wake up before he could follow suit. But then Sirius and Colgate were waking up, then he heard Magpie waking up, so he was able to 'wake up' as well. Pomfrey explained to all of them what happened and James and Sirius looked absolutely furious."They're in trouble, right?" James demanded."Yes," Pomfrey said, face a little pinched. "Slytherin has lost a good deal of points, and they have detention.""How come Peter's still asleep?" Sirius inquired."He and Miss McNab received a great deal of potion," Pomfrey explained. "I expect they'll be waking up shortly."She didn't want them all staying so after everyone got a late supper (Remus just poking his since he had already eaten) the three Marauders did wand-cauldron-book to decide who would stay, and Sirius won, so James and Remus left the hospital wing with the rest of the Gryffindors, all of them complaining very bitterly about what happened. All five unanimously decided to go down to the entrance hall to see just how many points Slytherin lost, which was 70 points, putting them in last place, even behind Gryffindor.James let out a whistle. "Blimey.""That's about just under 9 points removed for each person they put to sleep," said Magpie."Seven," Remus mumbled and they all looked at him. "Th—there were t-two Slytherins asleep as w-well who—who I guess g-g-got—got um, splashed." He regretted right away saying it, but thankfully no one seemed to wonder how he knew this."Only seven points per person?" James looked a little disgusted."Three and a half, if you split it between both Mulciber and Avery," said Colgate, folding her arms. "They each got three and a half points removed for each one they knocked out.""If you split it up like that it feels... low," said Struthers with a scowl."They each should have lost ten points per person," James said, turning away from the giant hourglasses. "Two hundred points."Colgate pushed some of her curls back. "Seventy is better than none at least.""Still should've been more," James muttered but didn't argue any further."When we hit the Slytherins with the boils stuff, we only lost about thirty points," Remus whispered into James's ear as they headed back to the common room. "So seventy is quite a good amount.""We only hit four Slytherins then," James reminded him. "Which would be...""Seven and a half points for each Slytherin," Remus said as James tried counting on his fingers. "Divided in half—""Which is more than what they got!" James looked infuriated again, stopping in the corridor. "Bloody hell. We should put the mushrooms in their dorm.""We should do worse to them," Remus said.James grinned from ear to ear. "That's the Marauder spirit.""We're still putting the mushrooms in Craft's drawer, right?""Oh, yeah."They had postponed getting the jumping mushrooms, and James had bought a bunch over the Christmas holidays. He had shown the others the wriggling bag full of them. Not 'hundreds' like James had wanted, but a few dozen. Instead of filling Craft's trunk, they were going to put them in his underwear drawer. They still needed to figure out how to get into the Ravenclaw dorm though, but that was for another day.Lily was very relieved when Remus went into the common room, hugging him tightly and proclaiming how worried she had been. "Ali said you were right behind her," she said, brow all wrinkled."We... were..." Remus said slowly, as James rolled his eyes behind Lily. "James and I were just discussing—""Revenge?" Lily asked and Remus pressed his lips thin. "Oh, don't look like that, I figured you were going to do something. Mulciber and Avery deserve it for what they did. I don't think it was an accident at all—""Accident?" James cut her off, stepping closer. "Who says it was an accident? Who lights up rockets in a classroom and throws them in cauldrons by accident?"Lily shook her head. "No, you misunderstood me. Sev says—""Oh, Snivellus.""Let me talk!" she snapped, stomping her foot. "He knows it wasn't an accident like that, but he thought Mulciber and Avery were aiming at random. But I could tell they purposely chose you four."James folded his arms. "Why was he even pretending it wasn't on purpose?""Because—because I was so distraught over Ali being knocked out," she replied, "and I was very angry, and maybe I threatened to turn them into spiders."James snorted. "Wow Red, you and I might have more in common than—okay never mind, I think I'm gonna be sick all over the common room if I finish that sentence.""Good, because I would too.""Then that's another thing you have in common," Remus teased and they both stared at him aghast; he couldn't help but laugh at their faces."Anyway..." Lily began pulling her notes out of her bag, handing them to Remus. "You can have those, they're copies. As for what I was saying earlier, Sev said they weren't purposely attacking Alice, and I mean I guess they weren't since they were purposely attacking you four... did you do something to them?""Nope," James said. "Haven't done anything to them since the sticking solution full of itching powder. Errr, well, might have tripped them a few times before the Christmas holidays, I don't remember who all we've tripped. We do that a lot, you know."Lily gave him a look, obviously not believing him. "Right. In any case, I'm very happy you're all right." She hugged Remus again."No hug for me?" James teased. Lily pulled out her wand and he dove behind Remus. "Joking, joking, I'd rather hug the giant squid!""That's good, you should stay within your own species." Lily whirled around and huffed off."What's got her wand in a knot?" James grumbled, messing up his hair."You," Remus answered. "Pretty much the answer is always you, or Sirius."They went up to the dorm to wait for the others. Remus looked through Lily's notes while James tossed a Quaffle at the wall until he wheedled Remus enough to join in throwing it back and forth, which Remus absolutely failed at. After what felt like far too long (but really was less than an hour) Sirius and Peter came in. James and Remus crowded around Peter, glad he was okay, filling him in on everything they knew as well as the desire for revenge, and, of course, the need to figure out how to get into the Ravenclaw dorm which really should be soon so the mushrooms still had plenty of jump left in them./\/\/\/\/\"You okay?"As soon as the Marauders went into the greenhouse Tuesday morning a load of Hufflepuffs crowded around them. They had heard what happened—or at least, rumors of what happened which none of them could agree on. James and Sirius puffed out their chests, preening under all the attention, and trying to make it sound worse than it was until Colgate interrupted them with the truth. All the Hufflepuffs agreed that seventy points wasn't enough, complaining about Mulciber and Avery until Sprout called for everyone to quiet down please.After class and their usual showers, James and Sirius went under the invisibility cloak while Remus and Peter casually walked through the school around where they thought the Ravenclaw dorm might be. They finally found a spiraling staircase on the west side of the school with a bunch of Ravenclaws hanging out at the bottom, most of whom gave Remus and Peter dirty looks when they tried to go up the stairwell. There was no one at the top, but a doorway with a bronze eagle head knocker."Knock," Remus heard James whisper.Remus crinkled his nose then reached out for the knocker when it opened its beak and began talking. "I never was, am always to be. No one ever saw me—""Hey!"The older Ravenclaws came hurrying up the stairs as the eagle head continued talking."—nor ever will. And yet I am—""Get away from there!" The Ravenclaws pushed between Remus and Peter, and the door."—the confidence of all. To live and breathe on this terrestrial ball," the eagle head finished."S—sorry!" Remus said, backing up. The Ravenclaws all glowered, and one held out a hand, making a shooing motion. Remus and Peter backed up then ran down the spiral staircase. He could hear James and Sirius following."What was that about?" James whispered as they ducked down a side corridor."Definitely the Ravenclaw dorms with how they were acting," said Peter."But what was the eagle thing going on about? Terrestrial balls?" Sirius asked, and then snickered. "Balls.""A riddle, it was a riddle," Remus said, collapsing onto a bench. "That must be how you get in. The answer is 'tomorrow'. Nobody's around."James and Sirius tugged the cloak off, tucking it into James's bag. "So, we just answer the riddle to get in?" Sirius inquired. "We can do this at supper, or lunch. You said the answer is 'tomorrow'?""Yes but..." Remus shrugged, "it... might not be the same riddle. You might need to solve a different riddle entirely." James and Sirius looked at each other, then at Remus who paled a bit. "No—""You've snuck into the Slytherin dorms!" James said, grabbing his hand. "And the Gryffindor girl's side! What's so bad about going into the Ravenclaw dorms?"Peter elbowed Remus. "You are the one who wants to prank Craft so bad.""Aw, c'mon Brains, we need you for this," said Sirius with a dazzling smile that threatened to yank the box right off until Remus remembered that he and Inkwood had kissed, and that gave him enough sense to jam the box right back down.James was still holding his hand. "Please? Pretty please? I'm crap at riddles."Remus moaned out. "Fine! Of course, I don't really need to go in, I could just answer the riddle and you guys go in, if I can even answer the riddle..." However he was very curious what the Ravenclaw common room might look like. The Slytherin common room was very cool. What did the Ravenclaws live in? They were the only other house in a tower. Would it be similar to the Gryffindors? Or something else entirely? "All right, all right," he finally agreed, and James and Sirius exchanged high fives. "Tomorrow, though. I have Occlumency tonight, and I don't want to be late.""I have practice and I won't be late," James said, but Remus shook his head."Tomorrow.""You have Study Group?""I'd... rather risk being late for Study Group than Occlumency."James bobbed his head up and down. "Fair enough. Tomorrow, then."And tonight Fawley, and ask her not to look at any of my Christmas memories, Remus thought, thinking of his father hitting him so hard he had gone down to the floor. He knew she'd completely misunderstand and cause problems, so he crossed his fingers that he'd be able to convince her to exit his head for any memory from the holidays.

Author's note: internalized homophobia in this chapter again. Also I want to address an issue: I know Shifting Lines isn't super British. I am aware of this. I'm trying my best to make it as British as I can but ultimately it won't be, because I'm not. I am sorry for this and if it really bothers you then please don't push yourself by reading this fanfic. Also for those who aren't in my discord server: my mother is home and doing well :)/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus went to Defense Against the Dark Arts with great trepidation. He had been avoiding looking at Professor Prewett the previous day, and at breakfast and lunch, but now he had to face him fully. Maybe whatever it was will be done and over, maybe it was a momentary issue that is now gone, he thought then went into the room. He was struck immediately by how good Prewett looked, and sank down in his seat with absolute misery. Crap. It's not gone.Just... stay calm. Remus took notes as Prewett talked, only glancing up a few times to see the chalkboard although even Prewett's voice made him... augh! He shivered, shifted in his seat, and began to grow hot as Prewett continued talking, his deep voice filling Remus's head.It makes sense, he reasoned with himself. Lily and all the girls insist Prewett is good looking so it's just like it is with Sirius. They're naturally attractive people. It doesn't mean anything. It was just odd that it suddenly hit him after the holidays. He wondered what it might mean, but just dismissed it as well since whatever it meant was pointless, like the squirmy feelings inside of him. Pointless. Stupid. Nonexistent. A figment of his imagination. It meant absolutely nothing.If it's like this for naturally attractive guys, when I start getting real feelings for girls it's gotta be bad, he thought, doodling on his parchment. Perhaps that was everyone's obsession with first kisses. Getting real crushes had to be ten times worse than this.Unless these are real crushes, whispered a voice in the back of his head which he promptly shoved into the abyss as quickly as possible. No. He refused to be—that abnormal. He couldn't be. He simply couldn't be. Liking someone of the same sex was obviously a degenerate choice and one he would not take. Soon he'd like girls, and this would all be over.As soon as Prewett dismissed class Remus bolted out as fast as he could, heart pounding./\/\/\/\/\As the day progressed several people stopped the Marauders in the halls to ask about what happened the day before (which at least provided ample distraction). James and Sirius stopped trying to spin tales (though they did make it out like it was agonizingly painful for them despite the burns not being that bad), and made sure everyone knew Mulciber and Avery were the culprits. At one point they came across Aegis who told them that in addition to the seventy points lost, Mulciber and Avery had also gotten three nights of detention each."Not enough, in my opinion," said Aegis, and Sirius actually gave him a grin. "I'm glad you recovered swiftly, Remus," he went on to say then his eyes went wide. "Oh! And, of course, you three as well!" he added to the other Marauders. "I—I did not mean to sound...""It's all right," Sirius said with a shrug as he reached out towards a cat sitting in a windowsill; it sniffed his hand, then nuzzled, allowing him to pet it.Remus felt so confused, and worried for a moment that Sirius might be up to something by being so nice and forgiving towards Aegis, but when he asked later Sirius just looked down at the ground, kicking at the stone. "Ah, well, he's your friend. He's concerned about you too. So, there's that." That's all he'd say on the matter, switching the topic to excitement over sneaking into the Ravenclaw dorms the next day.After supper James, Sirius, and Peter went off to James's practice while Remus headed to Occlumency. He felt extremely nervous, tugging at his sleeves as he went, hoping Fawley wouldn't be too suspicious."Hello Remus!" Fawley said when he went in. In her hair sat the knitted rose he had made her, which made him go red. "How are you doing? How were the holidays? And the exams?"He went over, sliding onto the purple couch. "G—good, I think. And, er, they were good and—and the exams went well, I got an O in everything but Potions. I got an E in that.""Congratulations, that is wonderful news."They talked a bit about the exams and rather delicately of the holiday. Finally Miss Fawley handed him a present which turned out to be a book of short stories in French."I couldn't find any translated versions," she said. "But I know you can read French.""Thank you!""One of the stories is about a werewolf," she said and Remus blinked, confused as to why she would give it to him then. "In a good light," she added."Wh—what?" He stared down at the tome in shock. "But... that—that doesn't—people don't—""It isn't common, however it's in there," Fawley said with a smile. "It's from the 18th century. It's not a book that has been rewritten through the ages, so I doubt you would have heard of it before now."Remus suddenly examined the book again. "How old is this copy?" Fawley shifted in her seat and Remus was strongly reminded of James trying to act like something hadn't cost a lot of money. "Miss Fawley—""I think it's important for you to have something like that," she said, and then cleared her throat. "Perhaps we should begin the lesson."Remus opened and closed his mouth then carefully put the book in his bag. "Thank you..." He was anxious to start reading the book—to read a story about a werewolf written positively, which completely baffled him. "Oh!" he said as she reached out. "Erm, could—would it be okay if—if we didn't... um, if—if any memories about Christmas—when I was at home—they're not..."Fawley raised an eyebrow. "Did something happen?"Of course she'd suspect. "No," he said, trying not to sound guilty. "I was just rather miserable throughout the entire thing, missing school, and I'd rather not dwell on that. Please."Fawley was silent, unmoving except a tic in her jaw as she clenched her teeth. "Do you promise that is all?"He trembled slightly, breathing turning a little raggedy, hoping she couldn't hear it but figuring she could. "Yes," he lied.He waited, expecting she knew he was hiding something... and hoped she wouldn't figure out what it was. Or wouldn't press the issue.Finally she gave a nod. "Very well." Then reached out to put her fingertips on his temples. The first couple memories were mostly of the train ride back to Hogwarts though not of him opening the presents. Then one started of him at home, which Fawley broke out of. She tried again, and had to end the memory because it was once again of him at home. He tried to think of other memories. Of school, of the mushroom prank, of anything, but it kept going back to the holidays."I'm trying to avoid those memories!" he said when they broke apart for the umpteenth time."It must be on your subconscious mind," she said. "Besides, focusing on specific memories can make it harder to keep me out. I can try to push your memories elsewhere but in order to do that I might accidentally see what you're trying to keep me from seeing. Or you could simply tell me."Remus rubbed his forehead, his head throbbing with the constant in and out. "Let's j-just try again," he suggested but it was no good; they went back to the house in Dragon's Field. This time he could feel his memories being pulled as Fawley tried to shift them, and some of the memories went by very rapidly, and he was terrified one of them would be of his dad hitting him and then it was of him and his dad in his room and before he could do anything—Fawley broke out of the memories, just before the Incident. "Remus. Clearly whatever is going on is causing a lot of anxiety, and taking up a lot of your mind.""I don't want to talk about it." He pushed himself away from her, wishing he could tell her but not wanting to risk her trying to do anything about it."If your father—""It's nothing!" he snapped and she fell silent. "It's n-n-nothing.""You can trust me," she said.Remus shrank back even more. No. He couldn't. Not when it came to this. "If... if you see it... will you ignore it...?"Fawley took in a deep, slow breath. "See what?" Remus remained silent. "Remus...""Nothing, it's... it's nothing...""He hit you again."Remus let out a squeaky sort of sound and then jumped to his feet, grabbing his satchel. "No, no. I can't—it's not like that—""Remus—""I'll s-s-see you next week!"He ran to the door feeling hot, feeling so hot he might just combust and turn to ash, feeling so sick and scared she might still go to Dumbledore—that they might do something. Feeling like he wanted to scream because it wasn't fair she didn't understand!"Remus, you can't just run away from your problems!" cried out Fawley.Remus hesitated, hand on the doorknob. "Yes I can," he replied and left the room.He felt stupid for abandoning her like this, abandoning the lesson. It was childish and immature however, he couldn't stand it another minute. This was worse than anything involving puberty. The thought of them trying to intervene... of talking to his father... he'd be so upset. They'd both be upset, his father and mother; they'd feel betrayed. He could easily see their sad faces in his head. Plus it wasn't like—it wasn't like what she thought. He had been talking back, he had been very rude to his father, he had deserved it.Remus slowed when he heard voices, and forced himself to walk. Sweat soaked his armpits and palms and the back of his neck prickled. He stopped. Then turned around, considering going back and apologizing. He turned back around. Then back again."You all right?"He jumped at the voice, dropping his satchel. It was an older boy, looking concerned. He looked vaguely familiar."You seem a bit lost," he said."Ahhh. N-n-no, I'm—I'm fine," Remus said. "Trying to f-f-figure out wh—what to do.""You... don't look well," the boy continued, looking at Remus's face. "You're very pale. And shaky."I'm always pale and shaky, he thought, picking up his satchel. "Be fine. Th—thank—thank you.""OI! FRANK!" someone shouted and the older boy turned around. Remus glanced down and saw the Weasley kid who had been in detention with Remus that horrible Dedenne day, the one who had gotten in trouble for swearing. "GET YOUR ARSE OVER HERE!"The older boy—Frank—rolled his eyes. "Are you sure you don't need help?" he asked."N—no thank you," Remus whispered. "Th-thank you," he added again for good measure.Frank nodded and then ran after the Weasley kid. Remus watched them go and once he was alone he realized he felt a little less distressed. The distraction had helped. He turned back and headed down to the fourth floor... but Fawley was gone. He swore, and then headed to the Gryffindor common room, running whenever nobody was around.Dear Miss Fawley, he wrote, his scrawl worse than usual due to his urgency. He paused and forced himself to slow down.I'm terribly sorry for how I acted tonight. It was wrong of me to just leave.He stopped again, sucking at the end of the quill.I know we view certain things in different lights. I love my parents very much. I love my father, and he loves me. He's given up everything for me and to just dismiss him because ofHe stopped again then tore the entire letter up, and tried again.Dear Miss Fawley,I'm terribly sorry for how I acted tonight. It was wrong and very immature of me to just leave. I know we view certain things in different lights, and I understand your side of things. It's just not something I personally feel is something that should be bothered with. My father loves me more thanHe stopped again, and tore it up, getting frustrated at being unable to explain himself!Dear Miss Fawley,I'm terribly sorry for how I acted tonight. It was wrong and very immature of me to just leave. I care very much for your mentorship (should I call it that?) and I threw it aside. I'm sorry for wasting your time. I understand if you're angry with me and don't wish to teach me next week. Not with the way I acted. I apologize profusely and I hope you can forgive me.RemusPS: thank you again for the book it means so much to me.He used a drying spell, folded it up, stuck it in an envelope, and left the dorms. He went straight for the owlery, ignoring the angry squawks of protest coming from the owls. Arthur fluttered down and Remus attached the letter."Go to Miss Fawley," he said and watched Arthur fly off, rather uneven. Remus hoped Arthur could make the journey... he was getting so old... he really should stop using Arthur but...He returned to his dorm and went under his bed to feel bad and hate himself until his friends came into the dorm. He remained under the bed, listening to their excited chatter about James's first practice back, lamenting over Kirke still being a twat, and wondering where Remus was. He didn't answer, but Peter checked under the bed."Hey," Peter said, and the other two got down on their knees to look."Hey," Remus mumbled, poking at the wooden slats holding up the box springs. He wondered why the school even used wooden slats. Was it too much to spell every bed to stay in place? Probably..."You okay?" James asked, and Remus shrugged, digging his stubby fingernail into the wood. "Did... something happen?"When doesn't something happen? he wondered and then to his horror James lay flat on the floor and started squirming under the bed. He was kinda surprised it wasn't Sirius since it was usually Sirius being the one to go to Remus's side to comfort him. "James—"He nestled right up next to Remus. "You wanna talk about it?" he asked."... not really..."James nodded. "All right." And he put an arm around Remus, hugging him tightly. "Want me to go?"Remus frowned, not sure what to say in response to that. Part of him wanted to be alone but on the other hand it felt kinda soothing to have an arm around him. His body wasn't screaming at the touch; instead it felt comforting which was very nice. "N—not at the moment...""Okay. Want me to talk about practice?""Sure..."So James kept his arm around Remus, rambling on about his practice, excitement over future games, how amazing his broom was, how excited he was for Thursday when Remus could come to his practice, and on and on until Remus was lulled to sleep from a mixture of exhaustion and James's voice. He woke up not too long after, though, when Sirius told the two under the bed that Spinnet and Struthers were on their way up.Both boys wriggled out opposite ends of the bed, and James went to get a shower. Remus brushed himself off then bent down to get his pillow out from under the bed, and when he straightened back up he met Sirius's gaze; he didn't look very pleased, but it disappeared as soon as their eyes met and Sirius was smiling."You... okay?" Remus asked."Of course," Sirius said, giving him a thumbs up before going to his own bed.Remus set his pillow down, realizing Sirius had been acting kinda strange since they returned to school. Was it the fact his voice was changing? Or something else? "Hey, uh, Sirius?""Yeah?""I'm—I'm really excited to try out your present," he said, not able to say anything more since Spinnet and Struthers were there.Sirius smiled. "I hope it works out.""I think it will. And yours too, Peter," he added. "They're both wonderful."He climbed into his bed and arranged his schoolwork in front of him, really needing to catch up on everything he missed the day before, hoping that whatever was going on with Sirius wasn't too upsetting and he'd be all right soon./\/\/\/\/\Remus didn't get out of bed the next morning until around ten, quickly getting ready for the day and following his friends down to their usual late breakfasts they had on Wednesdays (which meant no Prewett, thank Merlin!). They were able to sit far away from anyone to discuss how they'd be doing the mushroom thing. Going right after Transfiguration might not be the best idea since they didn't think the Ravenclaw second years had class during that period and might be in their dorm. So they'd have to wait till closer till dinnertime. It was decided that James and Remus would be the ones sneaking in, and Sirius and Peter would try to hold up any second year boys trying to get to the dorm.They approached the door cautiously until they noticed nobody was around. Standing in front of the door they waited, but the eagle head remained silent. Finally Remus took the cloak off of them so they could be seen."What must be broken before it can be used?" the eagle head asked right away.Remus frowned, trying to think. "Your heart?" he asked."Remus!" James gasped out, sound rather shocked."What?""That's terrible! Anyway, I actually know the answer to this one!" He turned to the door proudly. "Rules!"The door did not move, the eagle head remained silent. "How can a rule be used once it's broken?" Remus hissed out."I don't know, I hear about something being broken and I think rules.""A horse?" Remus asked. "I believe that is what Muggles call it, breaking in a horse... though I suppose you could use a horse without breaking it in.""A chewy pill," James said suddenly. "You have to break it apart in order for it to be used. Right? Food! Oh, hold on." James twisted away and leaned over the railing. "Pssst! Guys! Help! What must you break before you can use it?"Remus tugged at James. "Shhh! Don't draw attention! We'll figure it out—""I thought you were good at riddles!""I never said I was! You lot just assumed!"Sirius and Peter came galloping up the steps. "What is it?" Sirius asked."What must be broken before you can use it?" James asked. "And it's not 'rules'.""A box of Every Flavor beans?" Sirius suggested. "You have to open the box—""Open it yeah, not break," James complained."A stopped broom," Sirius said. "You have to brake it for it to stop, and then you're using a stopped broom." Then he laughed at his own pun."How about an egg," Peter said, and the door swung open. His eyes went wide. "Ooooh! It was!""An egg?" James asked incredulously."Of course, you have to break it in order to eat it," Remus said, feeling stupid for not thinking of it sooner."Unless you're dying it," James said. "Then you don't break it for it to have its use.""Guys?" Peter whispered."I still think a stopped broom is the best answer," Sirius said."Ninety-nine percent of the time you have to break an egg to use it the way it's intended," Remus said."Really, the way it's intended is for a baby chicken to hatch," James said smugly."Guuuys?" Peter said again."Yes, and the baby chick has to break it—""But its use was pre-break," James snapped."If you put it that way, its use is to get a baby chick to living status safely and if the egg is not broken its use is never realized," Remus snapped back."GUYS!" Peter yelled."What?!" James and Remus demanded, looking at him.He pointed and they followed his finger to see the open door to the Ravenclaw common room, and several Ravenclaws standing on the other side watching them."Oops," James said, ruffling his hair. "Ahh. Hehe. Well."The Ravenclaws stared at the Gryffindors, the Gryffindors stared at the Ravenclaws, and then the four Gryffindors took off running, Remus tripping at the bottom of the steps and Sirius yanking him to his feet. They ran as fast as they could down various corridors until piling into a secret passage where they finally collapsed to catch their breath.James began shrieking with laughter with Sirius joining in, then Peter, then finally Remus."Their faces!" Sirius wheezed out, slapping his thigh. "Petey I wish you could've gotten a picture!""Me too!" giggled Peter, wiping his face off.James tried to imitate one of the sternly-shocked faces but was laughing too much to be able. "Okay, we absolutely failed at the mushrooms but that was pretty hilarious enough.""At least they didn't catch us in the dorm," Remus said, taking in several gasps of air."At least they didn't see the cloak!" James added, looking at the wadded up cloak in his hands. He shook it out then carefully folded it up, putting it in his robes pocket."We should probably avoid the Ravenclaw common room for a while," said Peter."What do we do with the mushrooms?" James asked.Sirius elbowed him. "Snivellus, of course! We could go do that now.""We don't have the current password," Remus pointed out.Sirius stuck out his tongue. "Don't be such a dementor. Fine, fine. We can go listen for the password after dinner, and then put the mushrooms in Snivellus's drawer tomorrow during lunch."After eating Remus headed to the library a bit early, spreading his stuff out to work on while waiting for the others to show up. He was so absorbed in an essay he barely heard the footsteps behind him until a stack of books was dropped loudly next to him. He jumped at the sound, looking up into the furious gaze of Raven Craft."E-evening," Remus said, trying not to sound too strained."I heard about what happened!" Craft hissed out, going around the table to sit in his usual seat."What ha-happened?" Remus asked."Don't give me that, Lupin! You and your idiotic friends were trying to sneak into the Ravenclaw common room!""Oh, th—that," Remus said, as if it was nothing."Yes, that!""We weren't t-t-trying to sn—sneak," he lied and Craft narrowed his eyes. Remus sighed. "If we were trying to—to sneak in, why w-would we just be—be st-standing around the d-doorway like that? We found out where your common room was and was interested in the whole riddle thing.""Oh, I'm sure," Craft sneered."I don't know what you think sneaking is, but it's certainly not arguing loudly in front of an open doorway that leads into a room full of people," Remus said, hoping he sounded convincing enough."You four are up to something!"Remus shrugged and returned to writing. "You always think that.""Because you always are!""Are you two on about what happened an hour ago?" Buckling asked as she came into view. Remus felt a bit nervous being around two angry Ravenclaws before realizing Buckling wasn't mad at all."They tried getting into our dorm," Craft said.Buckling adjusted her glasses. "Raven. It's Potter and Black. You honestly believe there's a place in the castle they haven't tried to get to?"Remus snorted, Craft scowled, and the subject was dropped.

Author's note: extremely brief (one sentence) internalized homophobia in this chapter/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Instead of just diving into pranks for revenge, the Marauders decided to spend time actually plotting stuff out. James and Sirius did sneak into the Slytherin dorms to put the mushrooms into Snape's wardrobe drawer ("Thank Merlin you two didn't have to deal with seeing his underwear!" Sirius moaned to Peter and Remus, and then he spent the rest of the afternoon in bed with a cold cloth across his forehead and all the lights off), then discussed ideas for Mulciber and Avery. During James's practice Thursday night Sirius, Peter, and Remus also bounced around possibilities for Kirke. They'd have to wait till James had detention which, by some miracle, he hadn't gotten yet even though they had been back from the holidays for a full five days.Friday afternoon, James did get detention when McGonagall caught him putting sticking spells on spiders and levitating them into Lily's hair. Lily flipped out and half shouted at him and half tried not to cry. She wasn't afraid of spiders in general but the fact they were basically glued into her hair was really freaking her out. McGonagall was trying to get the sticking spells removed but it was difficult due to it being all over Lily's hair now.Remus scrambled over. "Botofors! Botofors!" He began shooting spells, turning each of the spiders into buttons. Lily slumped a little, panting heavily."Quick thinking, Mr. Lupin," McGonagall said. "And impressive wandwork for doing it at a distance already. Ten points to Gryffindor." Then she turned to James who put on his most charming Potter smile. "Ten points from Gryffindor, and detention." She went over to Lily and had an easier time getting rid of the sticking spells without the objects wriggling. She allowed Lily to leave class early to go wash her hair, and everyone returned to their work.As they neared the Gryffindor tower, Sirius slowed a bit and tugged at Remus's sleeve to slow him too. James and Peter walked ahead, laughing about something or other."Kirke," Sirius said."Yes," Remus agreed, still feeling awkward. "We need to figure out exactly what we're doing before he has his detention. I know Professor McGonagall prefers assigning his detentions as soon as possible...""Yeah, I noticed that," Sirius said, rubbing the back of his head. "Mine too. You and Peter will get detention weeks past what happened, but I don't know why ours is instant."Remus couldn't help but smile. 'I know. Professor McGonagall told me once. She said she prefers to get yours taken care of right away because otherwise you'd just wrack up more detention."Sirius stared at Remus then burst into loud laughter. "Did she? That's brilliant! HEY JAMES!" He ran ahead to tell James who began laughing too. Luckily James didn't seem too interested to know why they had been discussing his detentions./\/\/\/\/\Remus went to Lily at suppertime and immediately she launched into a vicious rant about James. Remus listened to it all, nodding in agreement. He couldn't defend James about this, nor did he really want to. So he ate while she complained and then finally she took in a deep breath, finishing with, "I hate him.""That's understandable," Remus said between bites of his meat pie. "I'm sorry he did that to you."Lily raked her fingers through her hair, shuddering. "Thank you for transfiguring them. That was impressive."He didn't think it was particularly amazing, though he supposed it might be since the spell was best done on contact (especially for someone as inexperienced as a second year) and he hadn't done any kind of contact with the spiders in her hair."Th—thank you," he mumbled, flushing a bit."How did he even get so many spiders anyhow?" she asked, finally scooping up some food and shoving it in her mouth. "We only had one each," she added after swallowing.Remus blinked. "Actually, I have no idea. He probably nicked them."The spider thing was a big topic at Study Group. Everyone thought James was horribly immature and deserved worse, except for Bones who began laughing even though most the others at the table glared at him."S—sorry!" he wheezed out to Lily. "I know it was mean of him but... it was kinda funny...!""How is gluing spiders in my hair funny?!" Lily demanded.Bones hiccuped and covered his mouth. "It's n-not," he got out, voice trembling as he tried not to laugh.Pierce eyed Remus. "You didn't help, did you?""Remus rescued me," Lily said, still glaring at Bones who was sliding under the table now, giggling. "He turned them all into buttons. From a distance.""Oooooh!" Pierce, Buckling, and Aegis all breathed out, impressed.Remus began blushing and probably would have slid under the table himself but Bones was taking up the entire space by rolling around in quiet laughter./\/\/\/\/\When Remus returned to the dorms after Study Group, he froze with his hand on the doorknob, thinking that he heard his friends talking about him. He pressed his ear against the wood, listening carefully. One of them had said his name, but now they were discussing something about helping something? He pushed open the door, assuming they weren't talking about him however as soon as he did, Peter said, "But how can we figure out how to help Remus when loads of people—" and then Peter stopped.Remus paused in the doorway then slowly stepped in, shutting the door behind me. "Help me with what?" he asked."Nothing," Sirius said."Er, studying," Peter said."Your furry little secret," James said, and the other two looked at him. "What? Look, it's not like we can keep that a secret from him."Remus grit his teeth, going over to drop his satchel down by his head. "You can't help.""Says who?" demanded Sirius."Let's see... perhaps only... the entirety of history?"James snorted at that, flapping his hand. "Yeah, well the entirety of history went without the bat-bogey hex until Miranda Goshawk, so..."Remus gave him a look. "Inventing a spell is completely different from—""Look, what's the harm in us talking about it?" Sirius asked.He felt like pulling his hair out, knowing he couldn't explain properly. Knowing if he tried, it would hurt them. "Because it's not going to happen and—and I don't like the fact you're doing it! I—I know you want to help, but it's frustrating. And—" He stopped, the fight going out of him. "And you have helped, okay? With the presents. The earplugs help so much, and I know the blanket and the box will too. So, you have helped."James and Sirius looked dubious though at least Peter seemed happy.Remus pushed his fringe back. "So, please, okay? Don't."James and Sirius exchanged looks, then turned back to Remus. "Okay," they chorused, and he knew they were lying, but he was too tired to argue so he just nodded./\/\/\/\/\On Saturday morning, Remus was forced awake by James jumping onto his bed and shaking him excitedly. The reason for the excitement was made clear quickly when James dragged him to the window to point out all the snow that had fallen through the night. They had known it was snowing most the night due them staying up till 4 making probably too much noise in the common room (judging by the fact a prefect had come down on no less than three occasions to tell them to shut up, the final one including points removed and a few threats)."James it's..." Remus squinted at the clock. "Uhhhh...""Ten," James supplied cheerfully."Less than six ho—ou—ooouuurs," Remus yawned before shuffling back to his bed and falling face first back into it.James jumped on him. "Come on! It's Saturday! We can spend the day outside!""We can spend the day sleeping too," Remus murmured, trying to wriggle away from his friend.The door swung open and he heard Peter's footsteps coming in. "Is he up yet?""He's refusing to be up," James complained."Aw, c'mon, Remus, it's really deep out!" Peter begged, coming over to tug at Remus's arm. "Pleeeease? We need four for an even snowball fight anyway."Remus sat up, rubbing his eyes. "Can't it wait till after noon?" Both boys were giving him pleading, begging eyes. He groaned and threw his hands in the sir. "Fine, fine. You win. Let me get ready. Where's Sirius?""Still in the shower," Peter said while James bounced around the room babbling about snowball fights and sledding and snowmen. "You know him."Remus got ready for the day, rather slowly but he was still done around the time Sirius was finally done with his shower and typical morning hair care routine. The Great Hall wasn't very crowded, but a lot of students seemed pretty excited about all the snow. A group of Ravenclaws brought in a couple buckets of snowballs to chuck at their friends at the Ravenclaw table and soon the snowballs were flying until they were too small to be of any use.When the owls came, Arthur flew down to Remus, nearly knocking into him. He was shivering, and drooping. Remus took the letter from Miss Fawley and began feeding some sausages to Arthur, terrified at how awful his owl looked. Maybe he should start using school owls...? But they hated him! How was he supposed to correspond?"You did amazing," he praised, kissing Arthur.The letter from Fawley was short, promising Remus that she wasn't angry with him, she was just sorry she had upset him so much. She knew he was trying to protect his father and she wished he'd trust her.I think we should talk a little on Tuesday about things, though I won't press you. I hope you still show up.Remus folded the letter, sticking it in his pocket, determined to pretend he hadn't read that last bit.Since the Marauders had brought down their outerwear they didn't have to make another trip back to their dorms, so pretty much as soon as they were done eating they ran outside. The freezing cold air hit Remus's face, waking him up a bit. They tumbled out into the snow, searching for a place that wasn't too overrun by other students. They found a nice hilly section that was a bit too close to the Whomping Willow for Remus's comfort, but at least they had a stretch of clean snow to have fun in. James ran back to the school and came back with a couple shields to use as sleds. The other Marauders teased Remus about him wrecking the first time he ever sledded. He rolled his eyes, but didn't really want to sled by himself so he tried to crowd onto the shield behind Peter. Unfortunately there wasn't enough room. He'd have to go down by himself."Or sit in our laps," Sirius suggested.Remus was slammed by those feelings imagining himself sitting in Sirius's lap (and wanting to, what the hell was that about?! Of course he didn't want to, that was absolutely ridiculous and wrong!). "I—I—well—it's—" he stammered out, taking a few steps away from Sirius before he was saved from having to answer by slipping and rolling down the hill head over heels until crashing into a flat area. He could hear his friends laughing, but at least it was an escape and provided him time to put the box firmly back in place."YOU OKAY?!" James yelled down, and Remus, laying in the snow, gave a thumbs up.Soon Sirius and Peter slid down the hill to join him, helping him up while James used the locomotion spell to try to get the shield back to the top of the hill."We really need to work on the summoning spell," Remus suggested, shaking snow off."When are we supposed to learn that one again?" Pete asked as they watched James finally get the shield. James took something out of his pocket and began pouring it on the bottom of the shield. What was he doing?"Fourth year."James slid down the hill with a whoop, sliding a lot faster than the other two went. Really fast. Too fast, and the other Marauders shrieked as he came barreling right towards them. They scattered and dove out of the way as James whooshed past where they had been standing. He kept sliding along the ground and then began yelling in fear, jumping off the shield about ten seconds before it got into reach of the Whomping Willow. The Marauders—all of them laying in the snow—watched as the Willow slammed a branch into the shield. They heard metal buckling and then the branch whipped up, throwing the shield. It whizzed through the air towards the Forbidden Forest like a Frisbee, disappearing among the trees."J—James, that was school property," Peter said.James staggered to his feet. "Shit.""What did you do? What did you put on it?!" Sirius demanded.James pulled the vial out of his pocket. "A slippery potion," he said. "I wanted to use some of it as a prank but I thought it'd make the sledding really fun." He stared at the Willow. "That damn tree! Why did Sprout have to go and rescue it anyway? It's a dangerous nuisance! Who allows something that dangerous on school grounds?!"Just like me, Remus thought, reaching up to fix his hat. A dangerous nuisance who shouldn't be on school grounds. Even though they knew what he was, he refrained from saying that, figuring they'd just argue with him anyway. He was glad they weren't aware of the fact the Willow was there for him."James, you shouldn't be using the slipping potion as a prank anyway, it could hurt someone," Remus chided gently.James turned around, making a face. "Pomfrey could fix'em up in an instant. Besides, it's not any worse than spongifying the entire entrance hall, is it?"Remus went red, ducking his head and not answering.The four of them climbed to the top of the hill and used the one shield for a while, until they grew bored of sledding and decided to have a snowball fight. Right before they chose teams, James spotted Lily and her group of friends and wanted to have a snowball fight with them. It was three against four, but Remus said he'd sit out."No!" Sirius said. "That'd be no fun. We can find someone else to join the girls.""Ooh, I know! She was making a snowman a few minutes ago," Colgate said and took off. A moment later she returned with Magpie who seemed rather pleased to be invited."Should we do two girls and two boys on one team?" Lily asked, looking amused for some reason."Yeah, to make it more even and fair for the girls," James agreed.Lily's eyes narrowed and Remus gulped at the fury flashing across her face. "You little prat!" She poked James in the chest. "You think you'll get the better of us? No, girls against boys. You are going down."He's dead, Remus thought with a smile.They spent several minutes making snowballs and whispering plans, keeping an eye on the girls who were quite a few yards away making their own pile of snowballs. Remus could hear them and their plans which pretty much amounted to Lily muttering angrily about murdering James, and Inkwood giggling about Sirius."Ali, you can go after Pettigrew then," Inkwood said, "and Athena, you have Lupin.""Oh!" Magpie said, startled for some reason. "All right."James's watch went off and he shouted over to see if they were ready. A snowball flew over their heads as a response. "That's cheating!" James accused. "You have crap aim by the way!""I missed you on purpose, you dunderhead!" Lily replied. "Yes we're ready!""Well, thanks for the extra snowb—" James was cut off by a snowball slamming into his face, knocking his glasses off. He flailed and went flying down into the snow while the girls laughed.Then the snowball fight started. Remus tried his best to chuck his but his aim was bad and he tried not to throw them at full force so they landed far too short. Though that was better than throwing them far past the girls and making everyone suspicious. The girls followed through with their plan of making it one on one. James and Lily were furiously locked in battle, Peter and Colgate were halfheartedly lobbing snowballs at one another, too busy laughing to be serious. Sirius and Inkwood were shrieking and giggling as they chased one another around. Magpie turned out to have pretty good aim, and Remus couldn't beat her unless he let his full strength show, which he definitely wasn't going to do."Wh—white f-f-f-flag!" he managed to get out after falling down, out of snowballs anyway.Magpie came over and helped him up, grinning. "I won?""Y-yes," he replied and she pumped her fist into the air victoriously.Peter and Colgate had given up theirs too, with Colgate winning. The four of them sat in a snowbank and watched the others. Sirius had grabbed Inkwood around the waist and was spinning her around, the snowball fight clearly abandoned. James and Lily, however...Lily dove out of the way of a very large snowball and then yanked her wand out, sending a large spray of snow from the ground and into James who crashed backwards. Lily got up and ran over, scooping up a huge armful and holding it above his head."Well?" she demanded.James responded by twisting his body and kicking her legs out from under her. Lily yelped, dropping the snow (mostly on James) as she went down. James shoved snow onto her and she grappled him; the two began rolling around, fighting, and it turned into an actual fist fight."Lily!" Colgate jumped up and ran over. Remus and Peter followed, with Magpie close behind.Colgate grabbed Lily and Peter grabbed James and they yanked the two apart. James's glasses were broken and his cheek was cut, and Lily's nose was bleeding. They were yelling at each other, and swearing, and threatening one another quite violently. Peter and Colgate pulled them back even farther and finally they both calmed down.Lily got herself free from Colgate but just glared at James before whirling around, storming back to the castle. Colgate and Magpie hesitated before following her. Sirius and Inkwood had been watching from a distance and when the other girls left Inkwood whispered something in Sirius's ear. He whispered something back, and Inkwood giggled before running after her friends."What happened?" Sirius asked, approaching the other boys."Evans is a horrible, wretched, no-good, lousy, stinkin' brat!" James spat out, removing his glasses and peering at them. "Broken!""James, you broke them last week too," Peter said.James put them back on and glowered; Pete gulped, stepping closer to Remus. "There's a difference between me bending the frames and her breaking the lens! Ugh!" He swiped at the cut on his cheek so he could look at the blood. "She's just as awful as Snivellus, they deserve one another." At that he turned to face Sirius. "Did you have fun?"Sirius's cheeks went very slightly pink. "I—er, yeah, it was quite fun." He readjusted his hat, smiling to himself. "Are we done out here?""I am," James grumbled, folding his arms. "I need to see Pomfrey. She should be able to fix the glasses, at least they're not as ruined as what Snivellus did last year."They headed to the castle, all of them going to the hospital wing through Sirius, Peter, and Remus had to wait outside. James was right in thinking Pomfrey could fix them and it wasn't long before he came back out, determined to get revenge on Lily. Remus pointed out they had a lot on their plate already and James argued back that he didn't care, they had to do something."You—you hurt her nose," Remus pointed out, following nervously as James went quickly down the corridor. "You got her as much as she got you already." James stopped, actually considering this. "Please, let's just focus on Mulciber and Avery right now. Okay?"James let out a sigh. "Yeah, okay. For now, though. But later... she's gonna get it."/\/\/\/\/\The first enemy who 'got it' was actually Kirke, since James had detention on Sunday. The other three Marauders hadn't had much time to cook anything super fun out but they put their heads—and pranks—together. Their best idea unfortunately required glitter which none of them had, until Sirius said maybe Kim might have some. He ran off and half an hour later came back with a very large tube of glitter."How come she had it?" Peter asked."She likes art too," Sirius explained. "She made this really cool looking piece using glitter for the stars she showed me the other day." He held up the tube and gave it a shake. "I told her what it's for and she says we don't have to pay her back. HAH!"As it turned out they didn't have to wait till James had detention. The next morning he had Quidditch practice and Kirke would be there, so the other Marauders decided to do it then. Well, Sirius decided to do it then; Remus thought it would be a bad idea but Sirius was determined.Remus had the bucket, Sirius had the tube, and Peter just giggled a lot. Once practice ended they hurried out towards the entrance, waiting. Remus set the pail down and levitated it up to above the entrance, where you couldn't see it if you were coming out the arch. Sirius waited on the other side with the open tube.They heard Bell giving the last of her speech before finally the team started coming through. Peter was half-standing in front of Remus to hide the fact he had his wand out, while Sirius had his hands where you couldn't really see he was holding anything."Hey, uh, Potter, a moment?" Remus heard Kim say."Yeah sure!" James replied.Bell and Litten came through first, giving the Marauders strange looks but ignoring them. Charmer came bouncing through, and then Hooper. Then Kirke appeared. Remus flicked the spell and the bucket of sticking solution tipped over, dumping on Kirke. Sirius flung the tube of glitter out and it went alllllll over him, immediately getting mixed in with the sticking solution.Kirke shouted and staggered back, a few bits of glitter falling but pretty much all of it was now stuck to him,"YOU LITTLE WANKER!" he screamed at Sirius.Sirius just lifted the empty tube and grinned. "Oh, oops, that was supposed to be for James.""You lying piece of SH—"Kirke dove for Sirius who yelped and began running. All the other team members had stopped to stare at what was going on, while the ones who were still in the pitch came hurrying out. James's jaw dropped as he saw a very glittery Kirke chasing Sirius through the snow."What happened?!"James turned, eyes huge. He looked very nervous and rather frightened. Guilt instantly swept through Remus. He should have put his foot down a little harder..."It seems someone just stuck a bunch of glitter to Kirke," Kim said, giggling quite a bit. "OI KIRKE! IT LOOKS GOOD!"Kirke gave up on catching Sirius and instead returned to the pitch. "Potter—""I had nothing to do with it!" James said, panicking. "I swear I didn't—""It had to have been your idea!" Kirke snarled."James had n-n-n-nothing t-to—to do w-with it!" Remus stammered out, quickly moving to stand in front of James even though Kirke was very big and scary.Kirke looked at Bell who put her hands up. "Don't get me involved.""You're the Captain and he's just... done this to me!" He looked down at himself. "This is going to take forever to get out!""I'll inform Professor McGonagall about what happened," Bell promised."Make sure you tell her it was all me!" Sirius said, coming back over. Kirke jerked towards him and Sirius dove behind Bell who sidestepped out of the way."Trust me," she said, shaking her head, "I will."She headed towards the school and soon the rest of the team followed suit, most of them snickering over what happened. Kirke made a few vague threats to James before headed towards the castle as well, a trail of glitter following him.Sirius fell into the snow, laughing. "BRILLIANT! Did you see him?!""That glitter is going to be so hard to get off!" Peter snickered."It's going to be stuck in his hair for a while too," added Remus, giggling at the image.All three of their amused smiles faded when they realized James was glowering at them, his knuckles pale as he clutched the handle of his carrying case."J... James?" Peter whispered."I TOLD YOU LOT NOT TO DO ANYTHING!" he screamed. "I TOLD YOU! I SAID! EVEN THOUGH YOU CLEARLY DID IT I'M STILL GOING TO BE BLAMED BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS WE DON'T GET ALONG!""James—" Sirius started."NO!" James took a step forward, eyes flashing with anger. "Don't you James me!" He whirled around, shooting equally dark looks at Peter and Remus before spinning back to face Sirius. "The ONE time I ask you guys not to do a prank and you—you—" He took in a deep breath, nostrils flaring."Bell didn't seem to think—" Sirius tried.But James ignored him, and stormed off towards the castle, leaving his friends in guilty silence.

They weren't sure whether to seek James out or not, but when they went to the dorms he was there, getting ready for a shower. He glared when they came in and swept out of the room without saying anything."We screwed up," Sirius moaned."Big time," mumbled Peter."I—I'm s-sorry," Remus said, wrapping his arms around himself. "It's my fault.""How is it your fault?" Sirius demanded. "It was my idea!"Remus shrugged. "I'm the one who usually tries to stop the really bad idea and instead I happily jumped in. I should have sided with James.""We all should have, it doesn't make it only your responsibility," Peter said.Remus just turned away to get his winter gear off, not wanting to say anything more since he did feel responsible. He was supposed to be the levelheaded one in the group. He knew James didn't want them doing anything to Kirke but he not only encouraged it but joined in. Sure, it was hard to convince Sirius not to do things, however he could have easily convinced Peter and they might have been able to show Sirius it wasn't a good idea.The three were still moping around when James returned from his shower.Sirius took a few steps towards him. "James—""I don't want to talk to you," James said, throwing his dirty clothes on the floor. "I don't have the time, either. I need to go see Professor McGonagall.""We'll go with you, and explain," Sirius said quickly.James shimmied into clean trousers and yanked a shirt on, his glasses askew when his head popped back into view. "No." He quickly got his shoes on, tying the laces quickly. "I have no idea what's been said to her so—""Let us go," Remus suggested. "It is our fault.""We'll tell her that," said Peter who was chewing so hard on his lip it looked ready to bleed.James fixed his glasses and left the room, slamming the door shut behind him.Sirius slumped down onto his bed. "Aw, shit.""We should go see her regardless," Remus said, rubbing one of his elbows, his stomach twisting. "We should have gone to see her earlier.""But James is going there and he'll just yell at us if we show up," Peter said."No, Remy's right," sighed Sirius, slowly standing back up. "We'll walk slow. Maybe by the time we get there James'll be done..."But when they got to McGonagall's office door, she told them she was busy talking to James at the moment and to please wait. They sat down on the bench across from her door, all of them far too anxious to really talk. Peter kept wringing his hands while Sirius kept tugging at some of his hair to look at it, and Remus just twisted his jumper's hem around his fingers so tightly his fingers began to hurt.Finally the door swung open. James froze when he saw them before stalking off down the corridor, silent. McGonagall appeared in the doorway, motioning for them to come in."I assume you're here for what happened today?" she inquired as they took their seats.All three of them began speaking at once."Professor, it's all my fault, it was entirely my idea—""We wanted it to be obvious James wasn't part of it—""I'm s-sorry, I sh-should have put m-my foot down and—"McGonagall held up her hand. "Please!" she said, silencing them. "One at a time. Mr. Black?"Sirius cleared his throat and launched into a long tirade about how Kirke had been mistreating James, and how awful he was, and that they were all just sick and tired of it. He told her that James hadn't wanted to do anything about it and wouldn't even talk to Bell about it because he didn't want to cause any problems with the team. So he—and only him, not James—decided to do a little prank just to irritate him.Peter spoke next, basically supporting everything Sirius had said.And Remus agreed, stating he realized now he had been acting on his emotions instead of with his head, and he regretted not listening to James. He also made it very clear James had been against the pranking-Kirke thing wholeheartedly and he should not be punished for what they did.McGonagall listened to all three of them without saying anything. Once Remus finished stammering out his story, she settled her hands on her desks with a sigh. "I am aware that it is your responsibility, the three of you. I have no intention of punishing James. However I am a little disturbed about these accusations of Mr. Kirke bothering Mr. Potter...""Professor, he'd been against James on the team since it happened!" Sirius said, leaning forward. "He thinks it's unfair because James is twelve—""He did come to me about it," McGonagall said which surprised them. "I informed him in September it was Miss Bell's choice, not mine, and it is perfectly within the rules for a second year to be on the team. He was unhappy but claimed to accept my decision. He's been harassing Mr. Potter?""Yes!" Sirius said, and then all three boys began speaking at the same time again, explaining to her all the awful things Kirke has said.McGonagall had them speak one at a time again. She frowned at everything they said, drumming her fingers against the desk. "I see," she said when they finished. "I will certainly look into this. However, his harsh words are not reason to cover him in sticking solution and dumping glitter on him. Where did you get the glitter anyhow?" She peered over her glasses but none of them spoke. "Hmm. Very well. Five points each from Gryffindor, and a detention for each of you.""Yes, Professor," they chorused.McGonagall stood up and they followed suit. "I'll speak to Miss Bell and the others on the Quidditch team to investigate what you've said about Mr. Kirke. You said Mr. Potter didn't wish to... cause problems?""Not when it came to the Quidditch team," Sirius said. "He... really loves playing. He takes his position seriously. He was willing to let someone bully him because he was worried fighting back would cause problems for the team. He—""Thank you, Mr. Black, however this is hearsay. As I said, I'll speak to the team, and speak with Mr. Potter again. Have a good day."/\/\/\/\/\That Sunday was one of the worst days since the Marauders all became friends. It somehow felt worse than those few days in September when James was furious with Remus. Probably because James was mad at all of them and not just Remus. When they tried to join him for lunch he took his plate of food and sat elsewhere. At least after lunch he had detention so they didn't have to deal with trying to talk to him for a while.Sirius, Peter, and Remus puttered around miserably except for the stretch of twenty or so minutes when Kim wanted to talk to Sirius and they went off to a corner of the common room together, too far away for Remus to hear them over the din of the other students. Lily came over to talk to Remus and wanted to know if he wanted to do something, but he was too miserable. Of course she wanted to know what was going on so he lightly explained.Lily's forehead wrinkled. "I'm really surprised at you, Remus."He hung his head. "I know," he whispered, tugging at his sleeve. "It was an incredibly stupid mistake. A stupid decision. Mistake makes it sound like it wasn't intentional.""I hope he forgives you soon. I hate him but... I know he's your friend so...""Th—thanks..."James came back from detention and promptly went to sit with Charmer and some of her friends. None of the other Marauders wanted to stay in the same room as James's animosity—even if it was a big room—so they took their cards and left the common room, going to find an unused classroom to hang out in."How long can he stay mad at us?" Peter asked."Qu—quite a while," Remus muttered. "Least he was at me."Peter crinkled his nose. "He won't be for all of us... will he? He had me an' Sirius back then but if he's not talking to any of us he'll probably get bored.""Petey's right," Sirius said, studying his cards. "He'll get bored." He sounded miserable as he spoke, though, which was understandable. James would get bored but until then... it was agony.At supper, James sat with some third years and afterwards he disappeared. Remus hated to leave Sirius and Peter as well, but he had a lot of homework he needed to get done. He invited them to come to the library with him if they wanted, however they turned him down. At least in the library, studying by himself, he could pretend nothing was wrong. He stacked books on the table and scribbled various ideas down. Mostly for essays, some for other things he needed to do research for. He still hadn't found a good candidate for a lie about what he and his mother had. Nor had he found something to fix his problem with Potions. There didn't seem to be anything about just... stopping smells.No, that was a lie. There were spells for stopping smells on other things but they wouldn't work on a nose. He'd have to put the spell on the ingredients which obviously wouldn't work. He found loads of spells that would work like the mask he had once, however he knew now those were out of the question. Putting something with a strong scent in front of his nose just made him ill.He considered the possibility of trying to tinker with the spell to make a mask that blocked smells... but he really didn't want to draw attention to himself by wearing a mask in class!Soon he heard shuffling noises, a whispered 'sshhhh', and then hurried footsteps. He looked up to see Sirius and Peter scurrying over to him, excited grins on their faces."We have an idea!" Peter said, clapping his hands."To fix what happened with James," Sirius clarified.Remus shut his book. "Oh? What is it?""An apology present," Sirius said proudly. "I've got some stuff I can give to him—""And I am going to blow up one of the action shots I got from his first game!" Peter jumped in.Remus gave a faint smile. "That sounds nice but—""I was thinking for you, maybe you could like... do one of his essays maybe?" Sirius suggested, kicking lightly at his foot.Remus considered this. He knew James's style of writing well enough he could probably fake it. "I—I don't know...""Or just help him," Sirius added quickly. "With some homework.""Put it all together with a big We're Sorry card," said Peter."I... guess that would be okay then. I could do one of his essays. I know he hasn't started the one for Astronomy.""On Uranus?" Sirius asked.Remus glared. "You know damn well it's on constellations.""I prefer Uranus," Sirius teased and then frowned, going faintly pink. "I mean—I didn't—it's a joke, is all—""I know," Remus said, perplexed at Sirius's sudden change. "You make it just about every other week about Astronomy,"Sirius, however, remained rather pink nearly the entire way back to the common room. James was sitting with the third years he had had supper with. None of the Marauders tried to go over, as it was obvious he was still furious. They just went up to the dorm room. Sirius got out the pranks and sweets he wanted to wrap while Peter began shuffling through photos. Remus sat down at his desk with a clean piece of parchment in front of him. He began writing about the Ursa Major family, trying to make it sound like James had written it. James could rewrite it in his own handwriting so at least Remus didn't need to do that.After about one paragraph he set his quill down. The nagging thought that had been hovering around at the back of his brain since this had been suggested had come into the light. This isn't a good idea, he thought, chewing on his quill. It didn't seem right, giving someone presents as a way of saying 'sorry'. Shouldn't you earn forgiveness back without giving someone something?Maybe... you do though, maybe that's a thing friends do. Except, he and James hadn't done anything like that when they fought and made up. Buying him a present (or giving him something) never even crossed his mind! The same with his awful argument with Lily. She never got him anything. Or maybe because this was so cut and dry? With James and Lily, Remus's arguments with them had been more... back and forth, both were at fault. This time it was obviously the other Marauders at fault; James hadn't done anything wrong."Is this... normal?""Huh?"Remus scooted his chair back, turning to face his friends. "Is this what you do?" he asked, gesturing at the sweets on Sirius's bed, then at the photos in Peter's hand. "Presents, as an apology? Is that... normal?""Why not?" Pete asked, confused."I—I just..." He began fiddling with the ends of his sleeve, trying to figure out how to articulate what was going on in his head."James gets us stuff all the time," Sirius argued.Peter tilted his head. "My dad gets my mum flowers when they have a fight."Remus shook his head. He couldn't explain it properly. "I guess I'm not—I guess I was wrong. I don't know. It just feels a little bit weird. Like... you're buying forgiveness. That doesn't seem right to me?"Sirius and Peter both stared at him."If that's how things work just—it's all right," he continued, panicking because what if he was sorely mistaken? "I'm wrong, it's fine. I'm not used to—to friends. I didn't know."Sirius and Peter looked at each other then back at Remus."Forget I said anything, please," he mumbled."No, no," Sirius said, swinging his legs around so he could get up off his bed. "No. You're right. I didn't think of it that way."Peter set the photographs down. "It does seem kinda weird, when I think about it.""How about we give him the presents after we make up?" Sirius suggested. "Then it's a 'we're sorry' gift without it seeming like a bribe.""BRIBE!" Remus shouted, and they both jumped, Peter knocking his photos to the floor. "S—sorry, that's the word I was looking for."Sirius went over and tousled Remus's hair. "Glad we've got your brains."Remus ducked away, fixing his hair as heat flooded his body./\/\/\/\/\James wouldn't talk to them that night at all, when they were all in the dorm together. Spinnet seemed vastly amused by this and kept snickering, irritating the other Marauders. Thankfully Sirius kept his mouth shut.Remus tried to go to bed at a decent hour but he wound up staying awake well into the night, reading through the Compendium book which he had checked out again to try to find something to use, or even help him make up a disease. He scribbled down a few ideas—wanting the name to sound realistic, wanting the disease to seem like something that could be inflicted on a Muggle woman and passed through to her child.Finally, though, he was too tired and put everything away, curling up with Gwyllgi and falling asleep...He was walking down the main street in Hogsmeade. All the buildings seemed oddly enormous to him, stretching way up, their doors and windows becoming faces mocking him. He was lost. He kept glancing around, and calling out to his friends. Then he turned to the road and saw James. He gave a happy shout before running towards him. The street stretched on, James standing still yet never getting closer. Remus shouted, and James turned to look at him. He was angry. You attacked him, he accused, and Remus stopped. Kirke? Remus wanted to know. I'm sorry. I should have put my foot down...James shook his head and pointed. It was Kirke, on the ground, torn to shreds. Blood was splattered all over the fresh snow that hadn't been there a moment before. Remus took a step back, but James pulled out a bucket and threw the contents on him. It was a bucket full of glitter. As soon as the glitter settled on him it began burning. It was tiny shards of pure silver.Remus began screaming as the silver stuck to him, his skin bubbling up. The silver dug into him while James yelled at him—calling him a freak and saying how crazy he was and how they never should have been friends. Remus tried digging at his arms, tried to get the silver off. He collapsed to the ground as he took a sharp breath, silver shards going into his mouth and down his throat—He woke up screaming and thrashing, desperately trying to get the silver-glitter off his body. He kicked his blanket away, still screaming and crying, nails digging into his skin as he scratched and scratched, screaming, trying to get the glitter off, trying—He heard voices. Not just Sirius, but the other boys in the dorm waking up. His screams became pants as he looked up, seeing his curtains had been knocked open by the blanket falling partially off his bed, keeping them open."Remus?!"Sirius was at his side immediately. He paused when he saw the blanket and then cautiously pushed open one of the curtains."Oh Merlin," he whispered, face going pale for some reason.The other boys were there too."What happened?""How come we could hear him?""Did the spells on the curtains go wrong?"Sirius turned, shielding Remus from view from the others. "No, his blanket kinda fell partly off the bed, it pushed the curtains open so the spell didn't really absorb the sounds, that's all."Peter was craning his neck. "Oh my GOD Remus—" he started then Sirius grabbed Peter, covering his mouth."What happened?" Struthers asked."Nothing," Sirius said, holding Peter firmly. "Remus doesn't look well is all he meant."Remus finally looked down at himself, at what made Sirius go pale, at what freaked Peter out, and gave a small cry.His hands and sleeves were soaked in blood.For a split second he had no idea what happened then his hands began shaking as the possibility he had attacked someone fixated itself in his head, and he began screaming again.He couldn't stop even though he knew he had to, because if Spinnet or Struthers saw this it'd be over. At least the Marauders probably... possibly wouldn't turn him in. But who did he attack?! He had heard everyone in the dorm talking... except for James!Did I attack James?!Bile rose and he knew he couldn't keep it back. He scrambled away from his bed, crashing into the ground. He heard exclamations from the others but he pushed himself up—leaving bloodied hand prints on the floor—and ran. Blood smeared on the handle as he wrenched the door open, and he knew it was leaving a trail, dripping from his arms as he hurried into the bathroom.James, did I attack James?He threw up hard, feeling his throat being torn. His sides heaved until nothing more came up.Did I sleepwalk over to James and kill him?He collapsed to the floor, wrapping his bloodied arms around himself, trying to remember. He had never done anything like that before but what if everything had changed? What if he was attacking people in his sleep now? He'd have to be put down immediately before—The door to the bathroom swung open. "Remy?"It was Sirius."Remy?"Remus just started crying softly, unable to answer. He didn't want Sirius to look at him. Didn't want Sirius to see him or talk to him; just wanted him to go away and call the Ministry so someone could come and get him and kill him before he killed anyone else.The door to the stall opened and Sirius crouched down. He pressed a hand to Remus's arm, and Remus flinched away—or tried to; there was really nowhere to go."Remy?" Sirius asked again.The door opened and more feet came in. He saw Peter's grey slippers...And James's red ones.Remus lifted his head, trying to see through the blurry tears as Peter and James came into view. James, without a drop of blood on him."The others are... uhh... flipping out," James said, adjusting his glasses. "About the blood."Remus just stared in disbelief at James, then let out a tiny sound of relief that James was okay, James was fine. He hadn't attacked anyone. Of course, he knew deep down he hadn't killed anyone... it was just a surface panic; if he had truly believed it he knew he would have completely snapped."I told them—" Sirius started then stopped, sighing."Remus?" Peter scooted into the stall, trying to get closer. "What happened? Sirius said you had cut your hand on something..."He couldn't answer. He didn't know why there was blood. If he hadn't attacked someone... then what happened? He pushed himself into a sitting position and looked at his hands again. There was considerably less blood on them now that he had smeared it all over the place, but his sleeves were still dark red."Do you... know what happened?" Sirius asked and Remus shook his head, more tears coming."N—no. No. I—I—I d-d-don't—I—""It's okay." Sirius grabbed his shoulder. "Calm down. You were... scratching yourself. When I opened the curtains. I think that's what caused the blood. You seemed—well, yeah."Remus blinked a few times, confused. Scratching himself? Then he remembered the nightmare, and the glitter, and trying to get the glitter off.It was his own blood.He... hadn't attacked anyone. Except himself. Which didn't really count.He stared at Sirius then at Peter and James, then back at Sirius. "I... was?""Yeah," Sirius said, loosening his grip. "You were... um, screaming, and saying no, and your hands were up in your sleeves and you were scratching your arms pretty hard. I don't know how long you had been doing that. Peter, could you go get a washcloth?""Okay..."Peter disappeared as Sirius gave Remus a little tug, pulling him to his feet and out of the stall. Remus just stumbled after him, head whirring as he sorted this new information. He barely remembered scratching himself. It had been in the dream that he did that, wasn't it?Obviously not. He looked at his sleeves again."Wh—what did... you t-tell the—the others?" he whispered."That you cut your hand," Sirius explained as he guided Remus to the shower stalls. "James, could you turn it on?"James hurried past them and turned on the warm water while Sirius sat Remus down onto the little bench between the shower and the rest of the bathroom. Peter came back with a washcloth and towel, and Sirius looked at Remus."Do you want me to clean your arms off?" He reached towards Remus's shirt."No!" Remus recoiled back, reaching up to clutch at his pajama top. The thought of them seeing his scar was way too horrifying at the moment. He never wanted them to see it, and especially not under these circumstances! "I—I c-c-can do—do—do it..." He reached up, trying to unbutton his pajama top but his hands were too shaky and the buttons were soon slick with blood. He felt more tears coming at his inability.Sirius knelt down. "I can unbutton it, and then go," he suggested."N—no...""Remus, if you need help it's okay," James said and put a hand on Remus's arm. "You're really shaken up."Of course I'm shaken up, I thought I killed you.Tears began dripping down his cheeks again.Without another word, Sirius began unbuttoning the pajama top, making sure to keep it as closed as possible while doing so. Once he finished with the last button he got up and left, followed by James; Peter handed the towel and washcloth to Remus then left as well.Remus remained still on the bench, watching the water pour out of the shower. He slowly pulled his top off and saw the blood streaked along his arms, and very faint marks from the scratching that were nearly healed. He was too tired to take his pajama bottoms off... too tired to move to the shower. He wanted one of the others to come in and help but that was so pathetic he couldn't bear it; plus the scar.Slowly he got up and took a few plodding steps until he fell against the shower wall, still wearing his bottoms and his underwear. He stuck his arms into the spray of warm water letting the blood wash off. He considered just curling up on the floor and sleeping in there, but that would be too weird.He managed to get the blood off before turning the shower off and pulling himself back to the bench, pajama bottoms dripping water everywhere. He toweled off then didn't know what to do."We got you clean pajamas," Peter said from outside the curtain and then his hand appeared, holding the clothes,Remus took them. He didn't know what to say or how to explain how grateful he was. Them doing this. Helping him. He managed to get out of his wet clothes, toweled his legs off, then got the fresh pajamas on. He picked up the dirty pajamas and trudged out of the stall. All three of them were waiting for him, eyes full of concern."I'm okay," he lied. "I—I'm sorry for—for worrying you."They promised it was fine though they were probably lying, because why would it be fine? He felt like once again he made everything about him. It was like the werewolf thing was sucking them all in and becoming more prevalent in all their lives and it wasn't fair to them. He hated the fact he kept making scenes. It felt like they constantly had to stop what they were doing to help him! He was a burden, and loathed himself for it.They went back to the dorm where Struthers and Spinnet had gone back to sleep. Remus shoved his dirty clothes in the hamper then yanked the bloodied blanket off his bed, shoving it down into the hamper as well. He got a clean blanket out of the closet—the one his mother had made him, actually—and then climbed into bed, reassuring his friends over and over that he was fine, it was okay, he was feeling better now.They went off to their own beds except for Sirius who went to James's bed, at James's request. They talked quietly about Remus, mostly worrying about him, about the fact he had hurt himself.Remus held his hands out, studying his stubby fingernails, trying to remember clearly. He still wasn't sure if it had been reality or a dream despite the fact it had to have been reality since he had hurt himself! And that scared him, so much. Not being able to remember properly...Was something going wrong with his brain?

Author's note: warning for referenced child abuse, and internalized homophobia in this chapter/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus barely got any sleep that night. Every time he started drifting off, he'd think of the blood and what he had done, and jerk back awake. He also thought a lot about how he had vaguely assumed he had killed James, and hadn't completely panicked about it. Was that proof he was a monster? Part of him assumed it was because he knew even in his confused state he hadn't hurt James, because if he had he knew he would have tasted blood, or at least had blood on his pajamas other than the sleeves. He had known he hadn't attacked anyone, but instead of being scared of losing his friend he had gone right to 'I need to be executed'.What was wrong with him? He cared about James so much. He didn't understand his thought process. Of course, he didn't understand much of anything that happened however surely... he would have... at least been a bit upset... right? Or was he truly that evil?Eventually he became too exhausted and passed out, but was awoken shortly after by Peter who told him if he didn't get down to breakfast right now he'd miss class.Remus got dressed as best he could and hurried down to the Great Hall where he was informed he still had his pajama top on under his jumper. Remus looked down at the grey flannel then moaned, dropping his head on the table. He was too tired to rush back to the dorms. He'd just have to hope nobody realized it was pajamas..."By the way..." James cleared his throat. "About yesterday..."Remus pulled his head off the table, reaching up to peel the napkin off his cheek. He had been so out of it he hadn't even thought of the fact James was sitting with them—or the fact he had automatically joined them in the bathroom last night. Did that mean...?"It's okay," James said. "I mean. I'm still really annoyed, but I'm not mad about it anymore."Sirius and Peter cheered while Remus smiled sleepily."Besides, it was super boring not talking to any of you all day!"Of course.Professor Slughorn removed a few points from Gryffindor for the fact Remus wasn't wearing the uniform shirt, then took ten more points off half an hour later when Remus fell asleep during class. All the Slytherins except for Aegis, and several Gryffindors all snickered; he could hear Loopy being whispered, and Spinnet also whispered something about how at least Remus wasn't screaming this time."S—s-sorry, sir," Remus said, trying to smooth his hair down; he had been laying with the side of his head in his Potions book, so now his hair stuck out in awkward ways."I am very surprised at you, Mr. Lupin," Slughorn said before returning to his lecture.A moment later a bit of parchment fell into his lap. im sorry its my fault he caught you cuz i was trying to wake you up - SB. Remus wrote a quick note back promising he didn't blame Sirius at all.After class Lily waited for him to emerge and then pounced, demanding to know if he was all right. "It's not like you to fall asleep in class," she said, linking her arm with his. "And—and Cassie said she heard you had to go to the hospital wing in the middle of the night.""What? N—no," he mumbled. "I don't know where she heard that...""She said Spinnet told her."Ugh. "No, I—I got hurt a little last night but I didn't go see Pomfrey, it was a minor accident," he explained."I was worried you had another relapse, which didn't—" Lily stopped herself, faintly going pink."Which d-didn't what?" he asked, trying not to sound nervous. Didn't make sense? Didn't match up? Was she suspicious?Lily squeezed his arm. "Which worried me, since last time you had a relapse in the middle of the night you spoke about possibly leaving the school."Ah. "No, it wasn't like that," he promised. "I just cut my hand a little, that's all.""I'm so glad to hear that. Er, not that you cut your hand, I mean, but that it wasn't a relapse."He made a mental note to use his mother as an excuse for the full moon this month as well as possibly the next one; he had been having 'relapses' a lot this school year, and didn't want to risk Lily getting too nosy about his disease. Which he still needed to find a name for, or hobble together a believable enough made up one./\/\/\/\/\Monday, for Remus, was spent debating whether he was truly evil (probably) or just super out of it the night before (maybe), and continually promising his friends he was fine. They hovered a lot, asking him over and over if he needed to rest, or needed this, or needed that. They were a bit suffocating... but at least it was nice knowing they didn't completely hate him for whatever the hell happened the night before. He wasn't sure why they didn't hate him but apparently they didn't.Then, in the evening, the Marauders got their revenge against Mulciber and Avery. Or at least some of it.Initially, James and Sirius were just going to sneak into their dorm and do loads of sticking spells. They stuck down all the ink bottle stoppers making it impossible to get open (unless they thought to use the counterspell); they stuck together loads of their socks ("Stinky Slytherin socks," James moaned, gagging), as well as put sticking spells in their shoes, so the shoes would get stuck when they tried to put them on. They also put caramel in all their winter hats ("Why caramel?" Remus asked. "Why not?" replied Sirius).However, they had also found some of their scrolls of homework and had unrolled all the finished ones, put sticking spells on them before rolling them back up, basically sticking them in the rolled shape. That part kinda made Remus feel a little uncomfortable until he remembered why they were getting revenge, and changed his mind. He hoped Mulciber and Avery wouldn't even notice, and hand in the stuck-together rolls of homework for the teachers to get annoyed about./\/\/\/\/\By the time Tuesday evening rolled around, Remus was feeling a lot better. While he hadn't gotten a lot of sleep due to low grade nightmares about being evil that kept him tossing and turning, he got more rest than he did Sunday night. Plus having James back as a friend definitely helped. He was still worried about the whole scratching thing but did his best not to freak out about it too much. After all, it could have been something that came out of the blue and wouldn't happen again. If it did start happening frequently... well, he'd deal with it if that came. Or he could ask Fawley... but he knew tonight would be difficult enough with the whole... Lyall thing. Not something he wanted to deal with after Sunday night.He stopped in front of the door, taking in a deep breath and trying to steel his nerves. Finally, he went in."Good evening," Fawley said after he shut the door. "I'm glad you came. Is Arthur doing all right? He seemed to be really tired when I sent him off...""He's all right, he's rested a lot," Remus said, shuffling over to the couch. He set his bag down and slid his robes off. "He's getting really old. I need to... retire him, I guess..."He didn't know what he'd do without Arthur though, and suspected if he tried to get Arthur to stop delivering letters his owl would get very indignant about it. He remembered what James had said at the beginning of the year, how Arthur pushed himself like Remus did. He didn't want to constantly borrow Cocoa, but it was such a hassle using the school owls."Have you thought about my letter? What I said?"He shifted in his seat, tugging at his sleeves. "Yes... I mean, I—it's not...""I think we need to have a discussion about... your father."Remus swallowed heavily, ducking his head. "I'd rather not," he whispered."Did he hit you again? Over Christmas?"He didn't answer, couldn't answer. He knew she'd ask him again, but felt so sick at the thought of telling the truth... even worse at the thought of lying since she'd know he was lying."Remus—""Yes," he finally admitted. "I deserved it, though. I—I wasn't—it wasn't—"Fawley reached out, taking his hand. "You know it isn't right for him to do that. You do not deserve it."He yanked his hand away. "It's only discipline. Parents discipline their kids all the t-t-time!""Hitting a child is not discipline, it is abuse," she said flatly.A thousand responses filled his mouth but he kept them all back, forcing them down, trying his best not to lose his temper. Tried to ignore the wolf stirring inside of him, or the pounding word of evil monster radiating in his brain. He knew if he tried to convince her he wasn't a child and therefore it couldn't be child abuse, it wouldn't fly. He knew she wouldn't accept that he deserved it, even though he did deserve it."I'm not... upset at what he did," he finally said, which was only a half truth. "It's not like he—he beats me up every time I'm home.""That makes it okay for him to hit you?"He shrank back into the corner of the sofa, withdrawing from her, regretting ever showing up. He needed Occlumency, but could he pay this price? "I love him.""I know—""And he loves me."Fawley sighed, pressing her fingertips against her temple. "I'm only trying to help you. I know it's hard to understand—""I do understand," he cut her off, "I understand what you're saying, or trying to say. It's just...""Remus." She reached out again, taking his hand once more. "Please listen to me. Just listen, don't interrupt. I can't do anything. My hands are tied when it comes to this matter. I can't get anyone from the Ministry to look into what he has done to you because it will out you as a werewolf, and you will either be locked away or executed. I could go and talk to Lyall myself however, I fear that will make him angry and probably take you out of school, or even out of the country, and you will be alone with his abuse. I... absolutely... hate... child abuse. I wish I could lock away all those who harm a child, especially in your case when there are complications preventing something being done about it. I felt so guilty after everything came out about Professor Dedenne, because I had no idea. I saw a bit of how she treated you, I just didn't know the extent. And knowing your father hits you..."Fawley took in a sharp breath."However, as I said... what could I do that wouldn't result in you getting harmed even worse? It is a very unfortunate situation, and one I have heard of before... family members abusing werewolf relatives, I mean. Because either the werewolf is in hiding, like you, and getting the Ministry involved would be detrimental. Or the werewolf is on the registry, and the Ministry doesn't view it as abuse. Like you believe."All I can do right now is try to get you to see and understand what is going on. That what he is doing is wrong. That you don't deserve this happening. That perhaps someday you can get out of the situation yourself, without the risk of the Ministry being involved. That—"She stopped and then wrapped both her hands around both of his."That if it gets worse, you are to come to me. I can protect you from him. You and your mother both. All right? I can and will take you into my home, and protect you."Remus stared up into her face, gobsmacked by all of this.Of course the Ministry couldn't be involved. And there really wasn't much anyone could do. He didn't think his father would go ballistic like that if Fawley tried to talk to him, he figured his father would just feel bad that anyone thought so poorly of him. Lyall was a good father, and worked his arse off to provide for his family with everything they needed. Sure he lost his temper once in a while but so did Remus. And his father didn't deserve to be told off.But it didn't matter anyway, since there was nothing that could be done.And Fawley wouldn't go bother his father about this.The only thing he didn't really get was the last part, about going to Fawley if it 'got worse'. But there was a pleading expression etched across her face so he knew he had to at least promise."Of c-course," he said, twisting his hands around so he could squeeze hers gently. "Thank you." He didn't know what else to say. Relief flooded through his body over the fact his father wasn't going to get in trouble for something so trivial.Remus reached out and hugged Miss Fawley because he thought that would be the right thing to do, plus he was very grateful for her concern. The fact she was so worried about him made him feel good (even if it was off the mark), and the fact she'd be willing to take him and his mother in was also nice, even if it was kinda ridiculous too. He hoped that would be the end of that. No more awkward claims of abuse, or pressure about whether Lyall had done something or not.The lesson itself didn't go too well since he was so worked up with emotions over everything, but on the bright side she didn't see him hurting himself accidentally. Which... originally he had been considering asking her about, but now was a little worried it would make things worse. He didn't know why it would, but what if it did?He did, however, ask her about his reaction. He said he had had a nightmare about hurting James and woke up thinking he had hurt James. He told her he had run into the bathroom to get sick and cry, and was, for a brief moment, wanting the Ministry to come and execute him. Fawley frowned at all this."I—I'm just worried that I wasn't... instead of being terrified I had hurt someone... hurt my friend... I wasn't scared about it. My thoughts went right to the Ministry," he finished. "I'm—I'm evil. That's an evil, horrible, monstrous thing. I wasn't... scared about J-James... ""That is understandable you weren't scared," Fawley said."Wh—what?""You were exhausted, and under a lot of strain from the nightmare. You were confused and not thinking clearly," she explained. "Sometimes when we have intense nightmares or dreams, our brains are foggy and not processing the world around us properly." She reached out, hand on Remus's arm. "Your confused mental state after a bad nightmare is no indication whatsoever of your morality. You are a good person, Remus. All right? You aren't evil."Though it wasn't entirely true—him not being evil, since he really was, being a dark arts monster—he felt a lot better regarding his relationship with James, and his reaction the night before.They exchanged another hug before he left. He still felt pretty rough from everything and not really up to being social, so he went straight to his dorm to hide under his bed with a blanket, a book, and Gwyllgi. When the other Marauders came back from James's practice and found his bed empty they immediately checked underneath. He had hidden Gwyllgi under his blanket, knowing they would."Did everything go well tonight?" Sirius asked, not even bothering to say hello.Remus sniffled. "As well as can be expected. I'm very tired—" He was going to say he wanted to be alone, except also he didn't want to say it. Every time he did he felt like it was wrong to do so. They did so much for him (such as trying to help him when he was soaked in his own blood) so the least he could do was be available for whatever they wanted."And?" James asked, when Remus remained silent."How did practice go? Was... did..." Remus trailed off, frowning.James plopped belly down on the floor. "Kirke?" he wondered, and Remus nodded. "He's furious with me, still thinks I was behind it. But at least the rest of the team doesn't, and Professor McGonagall doesn't.""We are sorry," Pete said."I know," James laughed. "I'm over it."James went to get a shower while the others hung around in the dorm. Remus stayed under his bed, trying to force himself to get out from under there but at the same time really wanting to stay in the safe, enclosed space. Finally he did leave, but only because he knew Spinnet and Struthers would be up soon and he hated Spinnet seeing him under his bed./\/\/\/\/\He had nightmares that night. Not as... violent as the one from Sunday, but ones that plunged him into darkness nonetheless. They were of his father... yelling at him, shouting at him, shaking him, hitting him. Of Fawley showing up to accuse him of abuse, and Lyall taking Remus away from school. He also had one nightmare that felt distant and strange, where he was very small and his father told him he needed to help purge the werewolf from his body. Lyall lifted a knife and plunged it down—Remus woke up with a shriek, a plea of "No, Daddy!" He immediately covered his mouth but could hear Sirius stirring. I haven't called my father 'daddy' in ages, he thought as he heard Sirius approach his bed. He really hoped Sirius hadn't heard his exact words."You all right?" Sirius whispered, twitching the curtains open."Yes," Remus promised, then panicking as Sirius climbed into bed with him. He realized he hadn't really had any bad nightmares since he put the box into place, except for the one Sunday night. Which didn't count since everyone had gotten involved. Now Sirius was sitting on his bed, very close to him, in an enclosed space. Remus could smell him very strongly. His soap, his shampoo, and his natural scents that Remus would forever recognize and know.Sirius wrapped his arms around his knees and rested his chin on top, staring intently at Remus. "Do you want to talk about it?"Remus scooted back a bit, trying to put space between them. As much space as he possibly could without flat out diving out of the bed, which was a very tempting thing to do. "Not... really." He saw his father's face, and the knife flashing through the air. Sirius's eyes drifted towards Remus's arms and Remus scowled. He thrust his arms out, turning them around. "No blood.""I—I was just worried," Sirius said, a little guiltily.Remus let his hands drop. "Yes, I—yeah. Th—thank you." He considered things for a second then said, "It—it was one where... where I was killed," he admitted, though didn't dare mention his father had done the killing. Even if it was a nightmare, he was afraid it might be too weird and raise suspicion.Then Sirius inched a little closer and Remus wanted to scream at him to go away, please go away, please don't ever get into bed with him again. It was on the verge of too much for him to handle, and he began to grow dizzy. The small space was filled with Sirius's scent, and warmth radiated from his body. Remus could feel it, and wanted to go over and curl up against him.He remembered months ago, feeling that way in this same situation: Sirius comforting him after a nightmare. And, at the time, not knowing why he felt that way.Now he knew—except, he didn't really feel that way. Because surely if it was James or Peter or Lily, he'd still want that physical comfort. And the damn butterfly-squirmy-hot feelings were not really like that, they couldn't be like that, couldn't mean anything like that!He thought of Lily's letter over Christmas, and the fact she wanted to have her first kiss. He wondered if she still felt that way. If maybe he should get his over with. Of course, he wasn't even sure if kissing anyone was safe. What if werewolf spit—even as a human—did something? It was the werewolf saliva that spread the lycanthropic curse... or was it? Did one have to be fully bitten? What if... they were scratched by a werewolf, and then the werewolf licked the scratch? Would that work?What if he did kiss someone—not Sirius, obviously; a girl, with... with girly bits—and she got... infected? Not fully infected, but... something...He had been worried about this since becoming friends with the Marauders, doing his best not to share food or drinks with them. So far he had been able to get away with it... but did it work that way? Would Prewett know?Then he got an image of kissing Prewett, and he jerked, knocking one of his pillows off the bed. He blushed a little, reaching over to pick it up, making sure the curtains remained shut.Sirius had apparently been talking while Remus drifted into la-la land, and closed his mouth, frowning. "You seem very out of it.""T—tired," he gasped out, "that's all.""Right. Well.." Sirius raked his fingers through his hair. "What do you think?"Remus stared at him in partial horror, clutching the pillow. He hadn't the faintest what Sirius had been saying. He had been too busy panicking about kissing, and werewolf spit. "A... about me being... tired?" he asked, knowing perfectly well that's not what Sirius meant but he hoped it would prompt Sirius into repeating his question.Sirius gave him a puzzled look. "No. About what I said."Bloody Merlin, Remus thought, looking down at his lap. "I... I don't know, I—I'm really t-t-tired it's—it's hard to think right now." He prayed that that would be an acceptable excuse.Sirius looked very disappointed. "Oh. Right, yeah, of course. I shouldn't be bothering you right now anyway—""You're not a bother," he said quickly, and without thinking he reached out to put a hand on Sirius's arm. It felt like an electrical shock went through his body and he fell back, scared Sirius had noticed or felt it too."You really do seem out of it," Sirius chuckled, unfolding his long legs. "Are you at least feeling better? From the nightmare?""Yes... th—thank you...""Anytime. I mean that, you know.""I know. I mean it when I say thank you," Remus said, resisting the urge to shove Sirius out of his bed. Or ask him to repeat what he said, because he was very curious and felt super bad for disappointing his friend. Or, worst of all, hug him.Sirius cocked his head to one side, eyes locked onto Remus's eyes. Remus tried to contain his panic and fear that somehow Sirius would know everything. He—he was a natural Occlumens... What if he was a natural Legilimens too? What if he was super powerful and could see right into Remus's head without Remus being able to even notice? He... was fairly certain that was something Sirius would say but... it still worried him."Are you... sure... you're all right?" he finally asked, very slowly and carefully.No, he wanted to say. Not with everything going on. But he couldn't say any of it! Not even the nightmare-related stuff. "I'll be fine," Remus promised.Sirius sighed. "Okay." His tone was quite clear: he didn't believe Remus. "If—if you need anything just wake me up, or... you know, think about what I said..."WHAT DID YOU SAY!? "Yes, of course.""Oh! Should we do the stuff for James? I meant to ask earlier.""The—the presents? Yeah. I'll work on the essay tomorrow.""Cool. I'll let Petey know to make the picture." Sirius slid out of Remus's bed, whispering a goodnight before padding off to his own bed.Remus flopped back, groaning as softly as he could, covering his face. He felt far too hot and sweaty. And miserable. What had Sirius said? How was he supposed to answer? Could he possibly apologize the next day and say he had gone to sleep right away, forgetting what Sirius said exactly? That... could work.Remus tugged at his pajama top then pulled it off, shivering as the cool air touched his damp skin. The notion of asking Sirius not to come to his bed anymore slid through his brain. He—he liked having someone helping him... distracting him... someone to comfort him... he really liked that it was Sirius. But... at the same time he didn't know if he could stand to ever have Sirius in his bed again, especially with the curtains closed.No, it'll be fine, he told himself, rolling onto his side and curling up. It's fine.Because he didn't have feelings for Sirius, so there was no point keeping Sirius away. Telling Sirius to never come into his bed again would mean he did feel something and he didn't. So he wouldn't tell Sirius to stop. Couldn't. Because he couldn't risk anything close to an admission! And that's what it would be. So... he just had to figure out a way to deal with Sirius being in his bed.Or... stop having nightmares.Ugh, if it were only that simple, he thought, nuzzling against the cooled pillowcase the Marauders had given him in November. The care package. The next full moon was in eight days... his second one—well, third, technically, of them knowing. But the second one had been over Christmas so it didn't really count.Hopefully I won't totally destroy part of my body again...He tossed and turned, still feeling hot. Feeling desire for Sirius to come back and hold his hand, even though it'd be even hotter if that happened.NO! He squeezed his eyes shut and pressed his fists against his head, uncurling his fingers to dig his nails into his scalp. As if to pull the thought out of his head. No. Think about holding a girl's hand. Kissing a girl. Girls. Girls. Girls.It was no use, so he threw his blanket aside and crept out of the dorm. Soon he was in a shower, cold water washing away the heat and the disgusting tingly feeling he had been getting in places he should not be getting tingly feelings over boys.The shower seemed to help, and when he went back to bed he managed to finally drift back to sleep. Unfortunately, he had strange foggy dreams about Sirius that left him hot and sweaty once more, and when Remus woke up in the morning he thought he preferred the nightmares of being murdered.

Wednesday was quite a drag for Remus. He felt uncomfortable pretty much all day, and was pushed to the edge of his patience when he tried to talk to Sirius about... whatever it was Sirius had tried to talk to him about in the night. Remus told him he was very sorry but after going back to sleep he just forgot what they had talked about. Sirius cracked a grin and said it didn't really matter. Remus asked him what he said and Sirius shrugged, tousling Remus's hair and promising it wasn't that important.But Remus thought it was... Sirius had seemed really down when Remus didn't give him an answer right away. And now he was being so... so shifty! All right, maybe not shifty, but annoying with not telling Remus. And awkward. He definitely seemed to be acting awkward, or perhaps that was Remus's imagination.After Transfiguration, Sirius, Peter, and Remus presented James with their 'we truly are sorry' presents. James was quite surprised and promised he wasn't still mad. Sirius explained they knew James had forgiven them but they still wanted to show how sorry they were. James liked all the little gifts from Sirius, put Peter's poster-sized photo of himself during the first game up on the wall, and hugged Remus tightly, excited since he hadn't even started his Astronomy essay yet which was due the next night."Can I see it?" Sirius asked and James handed it over. Remus suspected that Sirius just pressed about giving James the gifts so he could copy the Astronomy essay; the suspicion turned to proof ten minutes later when Sirius sat down to write his own essay using James's—aka, Remus's—as a template."You know, I would have helped you if you asked," Remus said, folding his arms.Sirius tossed his hair out of his face, giving Remus a very amused smirk. "This is much easier!"Remus sighed. "Just don't forget to edit it enough to make it seem like you wrote it yourself. If you both turn in the exact same essay, Spring'll notice.""C—could you help me with mine?" Peter asked."Do any of you actually do your homework?!" Remus demanded.James flopped back onto his bed. "Occasionally," he teased."I started it," Peter promised, showing Remus the parchment.The ursa major family has a bunch of stars in them and constellations. Ursa major ursa minor draco booty cornel cane vernali coma borenich and others that form the big dipper. Ursa major was found by Tolmee. Tolmee discovered lots of constellations—Remus stopped reading, getting a headache. "Of course I'll help you. Come on, let's get to work..."After helping Peter, Remus finally settled in with Fawley's present, over a week after getting it. He flipped through until he found the werewolf story, and eagerly read. It wasn't very long but he was entranced. It was a fable about a little girl who got buried in the rubble of a house after a spell backfired; nobody was powerful enough to move the rubble with spells and nobody wanted to risk using blasting spells. They began trying to move it by hand but it would take too long. The hermit in the woods appeared and easily moved every piece of rubble, even giant bits of stone which he tossed aside as if they were 'made of bread'. He plucked the near-dead girl out from the remains, put her in her parents arms, and disappeared back into the woods.A few months later some werewolf hunters showed up to out the hermit as a werewolf, and wanted to make him undergo tests to prove it in order to execute him. The entire villager stood by the werewolf's side, and refused to let them test the hermit even though they all knew by now he was a werewolf.They got rid of the hunters, and the werewolf lived peacefully in his cave, occasionally leaving to find flowers and food outside the entrance.Remus closed the book, and went into the bathroom to cry in peace. It was an absolute fairy-tale, but it was so beautiful, and once he finished crying he went back to his room and reread over and over until it was time to go to supper./\/\/\/\/\Remus was unable to go to Study Group since he, Sirius, and Peter had their detention. They went to the greenhouses where Sprout led them to one of the big storerooms and gave giving them cleaning supplies. They spent the evening sweeping, mopping, and putting bags of fertilizer back into place."We'll take care of this," Sirius said when Remus started reaching for one of the very large bags. "C'mon, Petey."He and Peter lifted the bag up, grunting loudly as they removed it from its ledge; Sprout had told them to move all the bags to clean the area underneath then move the bags back. Remus watched, confused at why Sirius hadn't let Remus help before realizing... He never told them he was strong! Very strong. He hadn't thought about it when they questioned him in October, and it had never been brought up. They had no idea.Sirius and Peter lifted another bag, and Remus started to say he could help, he was strong enough to lift the bags by himself—but then he quickly closed his mouth, goosebumps rising across his skin. They had no idea how strong he was. What if... that changed their viewpoint of him? What if knowing how powerful he was changed things? He thought about the werewolf in the fable he read, and how the townspeople were grateful for his strength for saving the girl's life. But... that was a fable, and in real life a werewolf's strength was frightening.He should have told them in the first place but... it had slipped his mind with everything else going on. If they knew he could break things easily—crack stone, tear apart things no human should be able to tear, toss boulders aside as if they were made of bread—what would they think? If they knew when he was little he broke things all the time on accident or had hurt his parents by hugging them too tightly, until he learned to hold back on his hugs... how would they feel? Scared? He previously wanted them to be frightened of what he was capable of but now the thought of them actually feeling that way made him feel violently ill.He should tell them... but was too scared that it might change things."You just gonna watch us or are you going to clean?" Sirius asked when he realized Remus was just standing there.Remus blinked and took a few steps back, nearly tripping over a terracotta pot. "Sorry, just distracted.""I know I'm beautiful but you have to do some cleaning."Remus felt that like a punch to the chest. He quickly whirled around, ignoring Sirius and Peter laughing, as heat flamed up his face. He felt clumsier than normal now, trying to pick up the pots strewn about but dropping them. He knew Sirius had just been joking but it was close—way too close—to not feel out of sorts now."Awww, don't be mad," Sirius pleaded, misunderstanding why Remus turned his back to them. "I was only teasing, I know you're doing work."Remus took in a deep breath and turned back around, nearly dropping the pots again. He forced a smile on his face. "I'm trying not to laugh, you idiot. Besides, out of all of us you're the one chattering on and probably doing the least amount of work.""Oi!" Sirius let go of the bag and Peter yelped as it thudded to the floor. "Now look here—""Sirius!" Peter complained, desperately trying to hold the bag up and failing. it slipped through his hands and landed on his feet."Oops, sorry."Remus snorted and went back to putting the pots away, trying to pretend Sirius never said any of that. Of course it was a distraction from Merlin's beard they don't know this super important thing about me, though perhaps panicking over them not knowing he had inhuman strength was better than panicking over Sirius being aesthetically pleasing./\/\/\/\/\Remus worried about it all through the night and into the next morning, debating whether or not to tell them. He hated keeping such a secret from them. Plus it made him feel incredibly weird over the fact he was debating whether or not to feel guilty about keeping something regarding his lycanthropy a secret. He knew it wasn't that big a deal since they kept secrets from him (he still had no idea what the extra blood oath James and Sirius made on Halloween night was) but it felt so strange since a big part of them knowing he was a werewolf meant he should be able to be open with them, yet he didn't feel that way.It was strange to still be terrified of what they might find out about them after all of this, but he supposed that's how he went. Maybe he would tell them soon. He should. He just... wasn't really ready yet."What the...?"Remus looked up from his cereal as the owl post came, and a school owl delivered a pink envelope to James. He wrinkled his nose a bit as he studied the front of the envelope which only said James Potter with a little heart for the 'o'. Shrugging, James opened it up. Remus pulled back a little as a strong scent of perfume invaded his nose. James scanned the card then made a face."What is it?" Pete asked."A love letter," James said, sounding a bit disgusted. "Dear James," he read, "your Quidditch abilities are breathtaking to watch. I love seeing you on a broom and the way you throw the Quaffle. I can't keep my eyes off you during the school day either. I think you're the greatest. Please meet me outside the Charms storeroom on the third floor at 5pm tonight. Love, Anonymous."Sirius, Peter, and Remus all began snickering and giggling. Sirius gave a little whoop and elbowed James. "Somebody likes you!""Mmm," James mumbled, and dropped the card."You're not excited?" Peter asked.James shrugged, going back to his food. "Nope," he said, and shoveled a big spoon of potatoes into his mouth.Sirius frowned, picking the card up. "Why not?""Too busy," James replied. "Practices and pranks.""Awww, c'mon, you've definitely got time for a girlfriend," Sirius said, and he glanced very briefly towards Inkwood.James let out a sigh. "Maybe, but I don't want one right now.""What if it's a third year?" Peter asked, eyes going wide. "What if she's got big knockers?""What if it's her?" Sirius asked, and indicated the blonde, curly-haired girl who had kissed Peter's finger the previous year when he had had a splinter. She was sitting with someone who seemed vaguely familiar to Remus until he realized it was the Meadowes girl from Slug Club."Ooooh, what if it's Tanaka?" Peter whispered.James scooped some more of the fried potatoes from the big platter onto his plate. "I don't care. I'm not interested.""What are you going to do?" Remus asked."Nothing!" James snapped, angrily pushing his glasses up. "I already said.""I meant about the card," Remus clarified."I said nothing," James said stiffly."I think what Remy means is... are you going to just... not show up?" Sirius asked."Um, yeah!""That seems mean," Peter said. "You should at least go and tell her you're not interested."James groaned, dropping his fork so it clattered on his plate. "If I go whoever it is will just get her hopes up," he explained.Remus frowned, thinking that did seem true, but also just completely ignoring it seemed not so nice. He wasn't sure of the best way out of something like that—of course, he didn't get stuff like that anyway so...Sirius poked James's arm. "You should at least turn her down."James gave Sirius a funny look. "Yeah. I guess you're right."Then he scooted back, picked up the card, and climbed up onto the bench. A few kids gave him stares but mostly people ignored him until he cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, "ATTENTION HOGWARTS!" Remus quickly covered his ears. "AAAAATTEEEENNTIIOOON HOOOGWAAAAARTS!"The casual breakfast conversations died down as everyone stared at him, including the teachers.James waved the card around. "WHOEVER SENT ME THIS, SORRY BUT NO THANKS, NOT INTERESTED! HAVE A GOOD DAY!"He climbed back down, set the card aside, and triumphantly returned to his breakfast.Sirius raised his eyebrows. "Well. That's one way to do it."Remus and Peter were both laughing, and Peter knocked his spoon sending a large amount of eggs on him. He plucked as much off as he could then made a face, saying some had gone down his shirt. He excused himself from the table, hurrying out of the Great Hall."You know, that perfume smells familiar," Remus said, eyeing the card."You know who sent it?" Sirius asked."No... but I know I've smelled it before..."James rolled his eyes. "Probably in one of the classes."Remus frowned, struggling to remember when he had smelled that scent before. "No. I—I don't think it was in a class. It was outside..."Sirius leaned across the table. "Can you maybe figure it out?"James shot him a glare. "No. I don't want to deal with anything like that right now, okay?"Sirius glanced at Remus who shook his head. They had upset James once already, he wasn't going to do it again. Not so soon. But it didn't really matter because ten minutes later when Peter reappeared his eyes were bright, his cheeks were pink, and he whispered that he knew who had sent the card."What?!" Sirius shrieked. "How—how do you know?"Peter glanced around before leaning in, the others automatically leaning in as well. "I overheard it.""Who sent it?" Sirius asked eagerly.James tried to say he didn't want to know, but Peter cut him off quickly with, "Kirke."Sirius, James, and Remus all stared at him in disbelief."Kirke-Kirke?" James asked dubiously.Pete nodded. "Uh-huh.""Th—that's it!" Remus said, snapping his fingers. "That's where I smelled the perfume before. On Kirke."Sirius held up his hand. "Way-way-wait a minute. Are you telling me Kirke wears perfume? And sent a love letter to James?""No," Peter said. "I mean yes. I mean, he sent the card but... it wasn't s'posed to be a love letter."James pushed the card towards Peter. "It sounds like a bloody love confession to me.""No!" Peter shook his head now, obviously frustrated. "I went into the nearest bathroom and went into a stall to take my sweater off and get the egg out. And when I was in there Kirke came into the bathroom with two of his friends. Kirke was super mad, and cussing, and his friends were laughing saying that you got the better of him.""What exactly was said?" James asked, frowning."Ummmm... I don't remember the 'xact words, but it sounded like Kirke got his girlfriend to write it, and Kirke and his friends were gonna come to the storeroom to laugh at you," Peter explained. "You know, thinking you had some girl pining after you and you didn't."James narrowed his eyes. "I see.""What a bloody twat!" Sirius snarled."That's awful!" Remus complained. "Absolutely awful!""Only a real weirdo would do something like that," James said bitterly.Peter gave a slight giggle. "Weren't you going to do the same to Evans?""Yeah, that's right," Sirius said quickly.Remus smiled. "You were.""Ah—er, um—ahhh—w-well I wasn't going to laugh at her!" he mumbled, adjusting his glasses awkwardly. "Just send the note. That's all. And I didn't. So—so you know, it's not..."Sirius elbowed him. "We know, we're teasing. Still... I take it we can't get revenge on what Kirke did?""Absolutely not," James warned, pointing his finger at each of them. "Got it? Promise.""We promise," they chorused, and Remus knew at least he meant it. He figured Peter did too, and hoped Sirius did."Good. I mean, Kirke's little plot got messed up anyway so the joke's on him," James said, and the others nodded in agreement./\/\/\/\/\For the rest of the morning and throughout lunch the other Marauders kept teasing James about the love card which he laughed about too. He had Peter pretend to be Kirke all upset and Peter pretended to rip a hat off his head and stomp on it, sending the Marauders into more peels of laughter.Lily was very intrigued by the whole thing and asked Remus about it during lunch. He didn't want to admit Kirke had sent it—didn't want to get into that part of it—so he simply said what she already knew: someone had sent James a confession of love, and he wasn't interested. Nor did he want to hurt her by either showing up and giving her false hope or not showing up at all."Huh." Lily tilted her head, looking quite dumbstruck. "That... I mean, the way he went about it was a bit blunt, but it surprises me he wanted to be nice about it.""James is nice," Remus protested."Hmm."Remus considered asking her what had been on his mind the other night: her Christmas letter, about the kiss. He wanted to know if she still felt that way. But he also wanted an answer about werewolf saliva before he said anything, because if she wanted to kiss he had to know. He... really wasn't sure he wanted to kiss her, but he also wasn't sure that he didn't want to.Maybe kissing a girl—even if it was Lily—would fix everything.After Defense Against the Dark Arts, Remus slowly put his things away, ignoring his friends rushing about to leave. He told them he needed to speak to Prewett for a moment and they nodded, tumbling out of the classroom without another word. Remus clutched his satchel to his chest as he approached the desk. He had to wait for McNab to be done, though. She was asking about an upcoming quiz, and some of their assignments. Once they were finished, Remus stepped forward."I had a—a private question," Remus said, glancing over as McNab was still in the room, rummaging through her bag. She flashed them both a smile before bouncing out.Prewett flicked his wand and the door shut. "What can I help you with?" he asked, giving Remus a smile that made his knees a little wobbly.Shoot, I should have asked Pomfrey, he thought, feeling sweaty about being in a room alone with Prewett. He had such a masculine presence that threatened to kill Remus if he paid too much attention to it. Remus gulped and quickly looked down at his scuffed trainers."I don't kn—know if you c-can help," he mumbled, shifting from foot to foot. "It's about—about my—my..." He thought briefly of what James had called it before. Furry little problem. "Curse.""Ah...""I know you don't know much but..." Remus forced himself to look up into those sky blue eyes. Ugh. "Perhaps you... know s-s-someone who... might know or—or something...""I'll do what I can," Prewett promised, and gave him another smile.Remus's heart began pounding and he debated just running out of the room. It took all his willpower to stay in place. "The—the thing is... s-sometimes my friends—we... they—they share food. You know... t-take a bite... pass it a-around. They do it with dri—drinks too. And... I try to avoid them eating after me. Becau—cause I don't know what w-would happen." He swallowed again, sucking in some air. "The... the other night P—Peter tried to take my cherry soda and—and I took it back. He seemed a little weirded out." He apologized silently to Peter for using him as the excuse. "I'm worried..."Prewett waited a few seconds but since Remus remained silent he finished with, "That continuing to do this will make them suspicious?""Y... yes," Remus whispered, hugging the satchel tighter."Well, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with not wanting to share food or drinks," Prewett said. "You can just tell them you don't like to."Remus bit down on his tongue. "Yes, I—I know—but... but... the thing is, I just want to—I need to know if... if they do, would something happen? In case of an accident. Or one of them takes s-something of mine and—takes a bite b-before I can stop them.""Happen?" Prewett's brow furrowed in confusion. "What do you mean?"Remus looked back down. "I d-d-don't know a lot about my... bi—biology, sir. I know in... in... when I—I'm... like that... it's transferred through—through biting. I w-wasn't sure... if it's... saliva exactly. You know? And if it is—which I think it is—then... does my—my saliva right now... effect people? If I took a b-bite of a cauldron cake then Peter ate the rest would he... get sick?"This was the closest thing he could think of to asking if kissing would be dangerous or not. It seemed absolutely bizarre now, speaking it out loud, but he didn't know what else would work. Unless he outright asked about kissing. Which he didn't dare."Ahhh," Prewett breathed out, "I get it now. You're worried you might infect them."Remus nodded vigorously, still looking at his shoes."Hmm. That is a good question. I highly doubt that would be the case. Unfortunately, as I said, I don't know much about—about werewolves. I could try to ask someone if you'd like."Remus took a step back, head pounding harder than his heart now. "No. Um. N—no, that's okay. I appreciate it but—I d-d-don't...""I would be very careful," Prewett said, coming around the desk. Remus took another step back. "It isn't like I'd say I know one.""I—of course." He debated whether or not he should have asked Fawley. "It's fine. Really. I'll just b-be careful, and make sure they d-don't eat after me.""Do you not want me to ask?""No. I a—appreci—ciate it, Professor, but I—I'll just... be very careful."Prewett frowned. "All right, then. If you change your mind...""I'll l-let you know. Thank you." He fled from the room, nearly running into the other Marauders who had been trying to listen in. He gave them a scowl, though wasn't really annoyed at them. He figured that's what they were doing anyway. He told them he'd catch up with them later, saying he needed to talk to Pomfrey. It took a lot of begging for him to convince them not to come with him but they finally agreed, promising to meet up in the Entrance Hall.Remus hurried to the hospital wing and basically repeated his question to Madame Pomfrey who admitted she didn't really know either. She suggested he be very careful until he found out, and he said he would.I guess Fawley it is, he thought, heading back to the entrance hall. He wasn't sure if he should tell her it was because he was considering kissing someone or not. Would that freak her out? He knew perfectly well he couldn't ever really have a girlfriend. Because that would mean either lying to her about his condition... or her knowing, in which case she wouldn't want to date him because who would want to date a werewolf? But Fawley would probably see him kissing Lily anyway... if they kissed...Ultimately he decided to use the same excuse, although not adding in the part about making his friends suspicious since they already knew. He framed it in a way saying he just wasn't sure how cautious he should be. Then he tore the letter up. That was stupid. He had to always be cautious! She'd never buy it. Especially since he could just say 'hey I'm a werewolf don't drink after me'. No. He'd have to tell the truth.His stomach hurt as he wrote a new letter, saying how Lily was thinking about getting her first kiss over with by kissing a friend (emphasizing with multiple underlines 'friend'). Since he didn't have any interest in Lily and therefore no risk of the kiss meaning more, he wanted to know if it was dangerous or okay.The letter sounded pretty stupid, but he folded it up anyway. He thought about Arthur, and how weak he had been so he turned to James and asked if he could possibly borrow Godric, explaining he had a letter he wanted to get to Fawley and didn't want Arthur to go on another trip so soon, plus Godric was a faster flyer than Cocoa."Nah, I don't mind," James said, bouncing up and down. "You do realize it's after hours though, right?"Remus glanced at the clock in surprise. "Oh…" His face fell. "Drat, I—I wanted to get it out tonight.""We can," James said, and pulled his cloak out, waving it in a tempting manner.Remus bit his lip. "I'm not sure…""Aw, come on, it's only nine, it's not late-late!"Remus looked at the letter. Could it wait until the next morning? He wanted an answer as soon as possible but surely it could wait another twelve hours… right?"Ahh, I—yeah. Um, yeah," he finally agreed, and James let out a whoop."Whoa, Remus breaking the rules!" Peter teased and Remus glared at him."Can I come too?" asked Sirius in a falsely sweet voice. "Watch Remus Lupin sneaking around after hours?"Remus stuck his tongue out which soon disappeared as James wrapped the cloak around them both. It was only just before nine so the common room was still pretty crowded however they managed to get through it without any trouble. They went to the owlery and, after making sure nobody was around, James took the cloak off. He whistled for Godric and attached the letter for Remus."Thank you," Remus said, and instructed the owl where to go. Godric puffed his feathers out before flying out one of the windows into the freezing cold night air."Are you planning on missing Tuesday's lesson or something?" James asked as he held open the cloak.Remus stepped close to him, ducking under his arm so James could drop the cloak around them. "I had a question regarding... umm... You know," he explained as they shuffled through the corridors."Your furry little problem?""Do you have to call it that?""What's wrong with it?""It sounds so... weird.""What should I call it, then?""Nothing!""Fine. Is it about Blank?"Remus elbowed him, and James laughed. They couldn't say anything else though as they were passing some older students. Once they were out of hearing, Remus whispered, "You know what I mean.""Fine, fine. Sooorrry...""I just—""Is about your time of the month?""JAMES!"

While Remus waited for a response from Fawley, he threw himself into the multitude of pranks the others wanted to do. They got some more revenge against Mulciber and Avery on Friday morning by James distracting them, and Sirius using some of James's slippery potion on the handle of their potions spoon. Of course they partnered up together as always, and had a very difficult time holding onto the spoon. It also got a bit on their hands so they kept dropping things, including a jar of plimpy eyes which went rolling all over the place. Slughorn had them clean them up, which proved to be a very difficult task as the eyes kept slipping out from their grasp. It was hilarious (later Lily admitted to being unable to watch without mentally playing 'that song from Benny Hill' which Remus wasn't sure what that meant, but she assured him it made the scenario fifty times funnier and when she hummed it he did agree it sounded really funny). They were still trying to get the eyes by the time Slughorn dismissed class."Mr. Lupin, could you stay behind a moment?" Slughorn asked, and flicked his wand. All the plimpy eyes left over rolled into a pile which Slughorn swept into a corner. He motioned for Mulciber and Avery to leave and they did their best to put their things away. Finally they left, complaining loudly about everything that had happened.Remus felt nervous, worried Slughorn might blame him for what happened. But Slughorn gave him a big smile as he clasped his hands against his belly."Well now!" he exclaimed. "I wanted to see how things were going for you."Remus stared up through his fringe, bewildered. "Um. G—good...?"Slughorn beamed. "I'm glad to hear it. I've got a get together planned for near the end of the month and wanted to personally invite you. A Slug Club get together, of course. For the second and third years again."Remus blinked a few times. "The... S—Slug Club?" he whispered."Yes! I know you didn't come to the Christmas party, but I thought perhaps a smaller event might be more up your alley."No event is up my alley, he thought, annoyed. "Ahh... uh, w—well, um, thank you—er, thank you sir but I'm not—""Naturally Mr. Potter still has an invitation to the club... and Miss Evans is coming."Remus wrapped his fingers around the strap of his satchel, not understanding why Slughorn was persisting with this. He had assumed once he never RSVPed for the Christmas party that would be that. Apparently not. "I'm n-not very interested in—in clubs, s-sir," he squeaked out.Slughorn looked down his nose at him. "You're in a study club, aren't you?""Yes, but—""If your other two friends wish to come, they're welcome. If that will make you feel better."Remus stiffened. Sirius and Peter were now invited? That didn't make any sense. They weren't ever invited to the Slug Club in the first place! They had gone to the 1971 Slug Club Christmas party but only as James and Remus's extras. "Peter and—and Sirius?" he asked, wanting to be sure. Slughorn nodded enthusiastically. Remus didn't know how to respond now. Last year... they had both wanted to go so bad... did they still want to be part of the Slug Club?Why is he inviting them now? Remus was confused. Beyond confused. Did Slughorn want him part of the club that bad? Why? Even if he was top in his year (minus Potions) it didn't make sense for Slughorn to be this determined...An uncomfortable shiver went down his spine. He thought before there was more to Slughorn's interest in Remus beyond his brain. Now he knew for sure because he doubted Slughorn would go this far just for someone with good grades. But what could it be? His lycanthropy? That didn't make any sense either... except, he was the first werewolf to come to the school as a werewolf. Is that why Slughorn was fascinated?"I... I'll t-talk to them," he whispered, backing up. "Th—thank you, sir," he added, then spun around and left the room, knocking into the other Marauders just like the day before after talking to Prewett. "You've got to stop trying to eavesdrop," he whispered as they went down the hall."What did he want?" Peter asked.Remus chewed at his bottom lip. "Um, I'll tell you guys later," he promised, because they at least deserved to know. And if Sirius and Peter wanted that bad to be part of the Slug Club he could easily bear it for them. Probably. Maybe. Kinda. With everything they did for him, he could at least do that.He brought it up after Charms, on their way to the Great Hall. He repeated everything Slughorn said including the fact the invitation had been extended to Sirius and Peter too. He explained he wasn't sure why Slughorn was so adamant about it. Sirius messed up Remus's hair, pointing out his grades. Remus ducked away, smoothing his hair down and grumbling that it couldn't be just because of that."You are super smart," Peter said."Yes... however there are loads of smart students," Remus said, jamming his hands into his pockets. "I think it's more than just that.""Think it's 'cause of your—" James stopped, and Remus glared."Don't start that again—""Furry little problem?" James finished and dodged Remus swatting at him, giggling."I don't see why it would be," Remus said, not bothering to chase his friend. "If anything that should make him not want me to join.""Well, personally I don't see the glitz and glamor of a Slug Club meeting," said Sirius with a shrug, "so I'm not interested."I think it might be neat," admitted Peter. "Except. I wouldn't wanna go, because I know Remus doesn't.""I'm not going," James said.Remus glanced at Peter. "If you want to join, I'll go.""No. I don't want to join that bad," Peter promised, smacking Remus's back. "The Marauder club is tons better anyway. And much cooler."Sirius flung an arm across Pete's shoulders, yanking him into a headlock. "Eeeeexactly! We can have our own little get together.""Leggo, your armpit stinks!" Peter shrieked, struggling to get loose.Sirius ignored him, pushing him farther into his armpit. "The Monthly Marauder Meeting! No Slugs Allowed.""Who'd want to invite Snivellus anyway?" James asked as Peter finally popped free, and they all laughed as Peter staggered around pretending to get sick on the floorRemus felt a great relief and wanted to thank Peter and Sirius, though of course he didn't. He would have put up with it, for them. But was very glad he didn't need to!/\/\/\/\/\The weekend turned into a very snowy one. It started Friday evening and continued snowing throughout most of Saturday morning. Once it let up, the Marauders decided it'd be a very good time to do their 'indoor ski slope'. They chose a rarely-used entrance and began hauling snow in, using their cauldrons. They considered also using a rarely used stairwell but where was the fun in that? They chose one that, while not a main staircase, was used often enough. Plus there was a secret passage that led from near those stairs to near where the Marauders were bringing in the snow. So they piled the snow up in the secret passage first, Remus attempting a few spells to keep it cold. He wasn't sure if it would work or not but it seemed to help decently enough. Some of it was melting after a while but the passageway remained pretty chilly."How much snow do we need?" Peter grunted as they made their umpteenth trip. He tipped his cauldron over and began digging the snow out, adding it to the pile.James slumped down against the pile, panting heavily. "More than this.""Enough to—urf—cover a whole staircase," Sirius moaned as he hauled his cauldron up the steps.Remus seemed to be the only one not having trouble, but he pretended to so they wouldn't suss his strength thing; he still wasn't ready to confess that. "In other words," he said, pretending to strain as he stumbled along with his cauldron, "a lot more.""Whose brilliant idea was this?" Sirius demanded, folding his arms, his breath coming out in faint puffs.James heaved himself up to his feet and gave Sirius a light shove. "Yours, dummy!"Sirius squinted at the pile of snow. "Are you sure?""Yes!" Peter and Remus chorused."You said it was 'cause of the skiing thing, I 'inspired' you," Peter added.Sirius shook his head now. "Oh. Well. It was a bloody stupid idea.""Now you say that," James grumbled. "After we hauled in fifty tons of snow!"Remus surveyed the pile. "Definitely not enough to cover the stairwell.""Are we giving up, then?" Pete asked, collapsing back with a hopeful expression.Sirius shrugged. "I dunno. I guess. Maybe. I don't really want to haul in anymore snow. My arms are tired. I say we wait till we get better with spells to magic the snow in, or just... you know, make snow appear." He eyed Remus at that, and Remus sighed, mentally adding it to his list. He technically already had 'make it snow' written down but there was a difference between making it snow and... making a load of snow just appear.James wiped his hands off. "Right-o. We going to just leave the snow in here?""I'm not going to move it," said Sirius in a haughty tone.Peter wriggled a bit and spread his arms out. "We could have a snowball fight in here.""Orrr!" James's eyes lit up. "We could just make a big snowman, put'em in the hall. Just... a random snowman. In the halls."Sirius snickered. "Let's do that."They began working on the different sections of the snowman. Sirius and James worked together on the bottom, Peter worked on the middle, and they elected Remus to make the head since he was so small and 'probably the most tired'. Remus didn't argue.Once they had the sections made, James peered out into the hallway. They had to wait a few minutes before some kids walked off then they began rolling the sections out—except for Remus who carried the head. They opted to go to an even more populated corridor (and had to wait another moment) where they began building the snowman as quickly as they could. Remus poked it with his wand several times, putting the cooling spells on it to try to keep intact as long as possible.They didn't have much time to finish since soon they heard voices. They didn't even really have time to make arms or anything. James plucked his hat off his head and plopped it onto the snowman, and Peter reached up using his finger to carve eyes and a smile. Then they bolted down the corridor, away from the scene of the 'crime'.It was stupid... but a lot of fun. The Marauders laughed all the way to the dorms until they realized they left all four of their cauldrons back on the ground floor passage, and had to backtrack allll the way down to retrieve them./\/\/\/\/\The cooling spells apparently lasted quite a long time, as it was still there when the Marauders went to supper. They purposely took a route that took them past it. It was... rather melted with a large puddle all over the stone, but still obviously a snowman."You going to get your hat back?" Pete whispered as they passed by it.James shrugged. "Nah, I've got others, I don't care."Remus tried not to roll his eyes, and bit back a comment. They went into the Great Hall where several students were discussing the snowman, wondering who had put it there. Also wondering why the teachers hadn't done anything. Remus wondered the same thing, a bit surprised it hadn't been taken down... but of course he couldn't exactly ask without making them suspicious. Would they get in trouble for building a big snowman in the school? There wasn't really a rule against it so... technically they shouldn't. Unless it fell under the 'no making messes' which... it probably did, considering the amount of water that would spread upon melting.That night they stayed up quite late, and Remus relented to sneaking out of the tower for a very fun prank. Once the last student disappeared to their dorms at one-forty, James fetched his cloak and the four huddled up underneath. There was getting less room now and Remus figured that the end of their third year would probably mark the end of the four of them being able to be completely invisible, depending on how much taller Sirius got. At least they were able to now, even with the cauldrons James and Sirius carried.They went down to the ground floor, to an unused room near a hidden corridor that led to the dungeons. James unlocked the window and he and Sirius hopped out. They spent ages hauling snow into the classroom, being on the listen-out for anyone who might come by. At one point Remus waved wildly and they shut the window. James and Sirius were out in the snow while Remus and Peter hid under the desk, huddled together with the cloak wrapped tightly around them. Peeves came flying past in the hallway but didn't come into the room. Once Remus couldn't hear him cackling anymore, they resumed their work.After getting enough snow in the room they began making the parts of the snowman. Remus had been practicing the cooling spell all evening and he was fairly certain the snowman would last the rest of the night.Hopefully.The Marauders took the parts to the hidden corridor. First James and Sirius with the bottom piece under the cloak, then they came back to take the middle, then all four went with the head. They followed this routine at the other end of the hidden passage to a nook, and then from the nook to in front of the Slytherin common room. They put the snowman together right in front of the door with sticking spells (including sticking the bottom sphere to the stone) and wrapped a Slytherin scarf around its neck. They placed buttons to form eyes and a frowny face.It was nearly dawn by the time they collapsed in their beds, exhausted but very entertained./\/\/\/\/\Remus hadn't spent any of Saturday studying, and he had loads of homework to do so he brought some books and parchment with him to James's practice. James, Sirius, and Peter were all complaining of being super tired and very sore. Remus was utterly beyond exhausted—the full moon would be soon—but thankfully not at all sore. He perched in the bleachers with a book open in front of him, scribbling notes down, ignoring Sirius and Peter whining about their muscles. James didn't do so well in practice to the point of Bell even mentioning something to him."Is something wrong?" she asked after practice ended.James stretched his arms out. "I'm heartbroken over the whole love letter I got the other day! I haven't been able to eat or sleep, all I think about is that poor girl, and how I destroyed her heart!" He flung his arm up to his forehead and staggered back. "What do you think, Kirke? You think I hurt her?"Kirke opened and closed his mouth a few times, and went brilliantly red. James kept his arm up to his forehead, but was grinning underneath. Glaring, Kirke stormed off without another word.Bell gave James a suspicious look, and James smiled his Potter smile. "I think I'm feeling better now.""Potter—""See ya!" He raced over to the other Marauders, all of them snickering.As they were crossing the grounds, an owl swooped down, beating its wings as it looked at the four of them. It studied Remus for a second before dropping the letter on him and flying off. Remus tried to catch it but it slid out of his grasp, fluttering to the ground. He quickly picked it up, brushing the snow off. He recognized Fawley's handwriting right away."Speaking of love letters," James teased.Remus tucked it into his pocket and elbowed James. "It's from Fawley."He wanted to look at it but didn't dare in front of the others because they might see it (possibly try to catch a glimpse of it on purpose) and he couldn't ever let them see anything about kissing. No, he'd have to wait. Which he did very impatiently until well after lunchtime (where everyone was discussing the Slytherin snowman) when he was able to break away from the Marauders. He gathered up all his school stuff and went to the library. There he sat in one of the aisles that stuck out from a wall, in one of the benches there for absolute privacy.Dear Remus,I apologize for taking so long in getting back to you regarding your question. I wasn't sure of the answer so I asked my friend (Ant) who informed me that there is no possible way for you to pass anything regarding your condition to someone under those circumstances. I do urge you to be cautious, however. Your condition makes it very risky to be in a relationship. The Marauders remaining your friends is a wonderful thing however that is extremely uncommon. Please, please, please be careful if you choose to get close to a girl. I don't want you hurt. Or your secret to be discovered. Just.. proceed with extreme awareness and think very carefully before making any decisions involving kissing.M. FawleyRemus read and reread it multiple times until he memorized every last detail. Only then did he tear the letter up and—after glancing around nervously— set it on fire. He quickly put the fire out and brushed the ashes into his pockets. Then he propped his chin on his hand and began tapping a quill against parchment, thinking about her words. Kissing someone... was not dangerous. His saliva as a human was not dangerous. This was good to know. He didn't have to worry about the Marauders accidentally eating something he had taken a bite of. Plus he could kiss—Lily, he thought quickly before any other possibility dared enter his mind. I can kiss Lily, and we can have our first kiss together, and then maybe I'll finally like girls.He wondered if he'd end up liking Lily. He hoped not. He—well, he liked her dearly, and couldn't imagine not being friends. But that was it... they were friends. Very close friends. He didn't want anything like that with her. What if they kissed and suddenly she did? What would he do? Or say? What if telling her no hurt her? Or ruined their friendship?He began tapping at the parchment faster and faster, foot jiggling with nerves. He didn't want to ruin anything. Though she was the one who mentioned kissing—weeks ago, over Christmas, but still. The bigger question was would he be able to broach the subject? Oh... what if she already kissed someone else? Like Snape?Remus wrinkled his nose up, gagging a bit at that thought. Ew, ew, and quadruple ew. He looked down at the parchment and saw multiple holes where the quill had punctured through. He sighed, wadding the paper up and throwing it into a little rubbish bin nearly. It sailed past, skittering across the floor.Bloody hell, he thought angrily, swinging his legs around to go after it. As he bent down to pick it up he saw one of the tables—or rather, underneath. A figure was sitting there, arms wrapped around their legs. He could hear faint sniffling; a sound he had heard moments before but hadn't thought much about it.Then he realized who it was."Macd—donald?"She jerked her chin up in surprise, a flush creeping across her cheeks. She made a guttural sort of sound then looked around as if expecting the other Marauders to be there."It's j-just me," Remus whispered.She crawled out from under the table and straightened up, brushing off her trousers. "I dropped something," she said."Oh," he said, throwing the crumpled parchment away. He could see the red-rimmed eyes, and streaked cheeks. "I d-d-drop stuff under the library tables a lot like that."Macdonald shifted at those words, rubbing the back of her neck. "You do?""Mmhmm." He tugged at his sleeves, unsure whether to ask her what was wrong or not. "Is... are... are you o—okay?"She sighed, blowing some of her hair from her face. "Some Slytherins were teasing me.""Oh. S-some of them can be... rude.""Cuz I'm Mudblood," she said, and Remus flinched at the word. Macdonald narrowed her eyes at his reaction. "I know it's a bad word. Lily... told me a lot about that stuff. How people see us." She wiped her nose off on her sleeve then let her hands drop down. "I know people are like that... but..."Slowly she looked up, seemingly expecting him to say something, but what? He had no bloody clue what else to say, or how to really comfort her. "Er..." He tried to think what he told Lily the previous year, or what he might say to one of the Marauders. Except it wasn't them, it was Macdonald, and sure he talked to her very occasionally but he hardly knew her. They only ever really talked about school."It's awful," she said after a very uncomfortable stretch of silence."Yeah," he agreed. "Those p-people are d-dumb and—and you sh-shouldn't listen to th-their... err... dumbness...""Yeah," she mumbled, and he wondered if she expected him to say anything more.He had no idea how to proceed, and was tempted to retreat to his seat near the wall except he knew that'd be pretty rude. Part of him wished he hadn't said her name, hadn't accidentally drawn her into a conversation that seemed almost foreign to him. It was kinda like there were things he should be saying, he just didn't know what. The old, familiar feeling of being on the outside looking in on a scene he had to pretend to be part of came welling back up inside of him."If—if th-they keep bothering you m-maybe you should go to McGonagall?" he suggested.Macdonald rolled her eyes. "Do you go to a teacher when you're bullied?""T... touche."More uncomfortable silence. Macdonald coughed and then pushed her hair back, eyes darting towards another aisle. "I'm sorry for bothering you—""N—no, I—""—thanks though—""—ahhh okay. Um, yeah," he mumbled. "If you, uh, n-need anything..."She finally gave a small smile. "Yeah. Thanks," she said before heading off, probably to find somewhere else to cry where an inept idiot wouldn't bother her.Remus retreated to his seat by the wall and made himself as small as possible, cheeks burning with how awkward that had been. He had meant to be nice, but it just turned into a big embarrassing mess! Hopefully Macdonald didn't tell Lily. Or laugh about him, or go around reinforcing the whole Loopy Lupin thing.Remus dropped his head down against the table and groaned, wishing once more he was better at being human.

Monday morning Remus woke up feeling... exhausted. There were still a couple days till the full moon however, he felt it dragging at him already; of course some of the trouble was due to the fact he hadn't slept well. He had spent most of the night tossing and turning, trying to decide if he should talk to Lily or not. He ultimately decided to bring up the letter and ask her if she still wanted to... do that.If he wanted to kiss. Which he wasn't completely sure if he did.Remus was still on the fence when he slid over, sitting on the edge of his bed, and saw Sirius standing there. He was in front of the full length mirror, carefully tying his tie and running his fingers through his hair looking absolutely...Absolutely nothing, Remus thought, getting out of bed. And I will talk to her.Easier said than done. Remus didn't dare talk to her during breakfast or even ask to talk to her privately, and then they had Potions which was incredibly awkward for Remus. He felt Slughorn's new invitation weighing him down. Part of him wanted to go ahead and tell Professor Slughorn that day that he didn't want to be part of the Slug Club, but with the turmoil over Lily he couldn't bring himself to face him.After Potions Remus walked with Lily to Charms, but was unable to get the nerve to ask. He sat with the Marauders at lunch. After lunch came a free period, which would have been a perfect opportunity but when he walked towards Lily with the intention to ask her if they could chat privately somewhere, his stomach dropped to his feet and he kept walking right out of the Great Hall.Some Gryffindor, he thought miserably, spending the free period with the Marauders practicing some prank-related spells. Remus didn't really need to practice, so instead he worked on his timer spells. He pointed at a feather. "Moratempium," he said and the feather glowed red for a second. "Wingardium leviosa!" The feather floated up. Remus made a face. "Finite incantatum. Moratempium. Wingardium leviosa!" The time the feather shivered and stayed put for a full second then began floating up. "Yes!" he hissed out, and tried again.Three seconds. Then four. Then six. Remus was sweating bullets by the time they had to go to History and felt even more exhausted than before, but was very proud of himself./\/\/\/\/\After Transfiguration (which wiped Remus due to how he felt plus all the effort he had done with the timer spell) he decided he had to confront Lily. Now or never. He... sorta preferred never... but knew it needed to be now. He had to force himself. Not to mention there was always the chance she had changed her mind and didn't want to kiss."The letter over Christmas?" Lily asked when Remus finally managed to bring the subject up as they walked through the halls together. She stared at him in confusion for a few seconds before realization filled her face... followed shortly by embarrassment. "Oh that! Hah! No, I didn't—that was just—I wasn't really meaning it, honestly, I shouldn't have ever sent it.""Ah," he replied, hugging his satchel to his chest.Lily glanced askew at him. "Why?""Hmm?""Why did you want to know? About the letter?"Now Remus's face flushed. "It just... m-makes sense, you know?""What?" Lily turned to fully look at him.Remus stopped and faced her too. "W—with a f-friend," he stammered out, not daring to say the K word.Lily tucked some hair behind her ear. "You mean...?""Umm, well it—I don't know.""Are you meaning what I think you're meaning?"He scuffed at the floor, hating dancing around the word but not able to say it. He thought he'd die if he said it to her. To anyone. Writing it to Fawley was bad enough! If it's this bad just saying the word kiss, how can I perform the act?!"What you s—suggested in your letter," he said, glancing up through his fringe into her eyes.Lily focused on him. "You mean, kissing?" He knew he probably turned beet red at that, and he couldn't reply. Instead he just nodded. "You want to kiss?""I—I—I w-w-want to—to get it over with," he said quickly, stumbling over his words. "I've b-been thinking about what you said abou-bout it. It m-makes sense, to—to try with a friend. But if you don't—""Yes," she said and his eyes widened. "I mean, if you want...""Y... yes," he whispered.Lily shifted from foot to foot, chewing at her inside cheek, rubbing her elbow. "My mum told me I shouldn't have my first kiss until I'm older. And have a boyfriend. Of several months at the least. It needs to be special.""Oh.""But—you know, I—I stand by what I said. Whatever a first kiss is, having it with a friend is special enough, right?"Remus shrugged, tugging at his sleeve. "I d-d-don't know anything about—about kissing. 'Cept what I've r-read in books.""I saw Petunia kissing someone," Lily said with a slight giggle. "Over the Christmas holidays. She was late coming from a Christmas party and I saw out my window. It was quite passionate."Remus's face went white now. Did Lily expect a passionate kiss?!"She had her arms around him. They were practically snogging."He couldn't help but wrinkle up his nose at that, recalling the snogging he had overheard in the common room ages ago. "Sounds gross," he said."I think so too. I mean, kissing like that. But one kiss—on the lips—might not be bad. You... did mean on the lips, right? Because I've kissed your cheek—""Um, y—yeah," he forced out and quickly pulled his satchel onto his shoulder so he could wipe his sweaty hands off on his trousers. He was feeling dizzy all of the sudden, and terrified. Actually, what he wanted to do was run. Run far away from all of this and bury himself under his bed.Or in a hole in the ground, whatever worked.Except, he needed to start liking girls. He couldn't just wait for it to happen! Maybe a kiss wouldn't magically unlock his feelings, but it might, right?"Right now?" Lily asked.Remus jerked back, head swiveling as he looked around the corridor. There wasn't anyone else around but it was a public hall and someone could walk down any moment. "Ah—""I didn't mean here," she laughed. "I meant somewhere else. But, right now?"His stomach was shriveling up into something the size of a pea. He could feel bile rising, and his chest began aching. Everything was starting to go blurry and slightly black around the edges. He felt as though he were being squeezed, and also, somehow, that his skin was too tight and he might burst out of it any second. It was becoming increasingly difficult to breathe."L—l—lll—la—late—t-t—""Remus?!" Lily gasped, grabbing his arm.The touch made him think he might die. Disintegrate into a pile of agony. Or scream. He felt as though he might scream, too; or cry, or throw up, or laugh. He was overwhelmed by all these sudden feelings, and he could not deal with them at all."Later," he managed to wheeze out, wrapping an arm across his stomach. "P—Pomfrey now.""What? Rem—"He turned and fled from her as fast as he could, ignoring her shouts. His feet pounded the stone until he tripped, slamming face first into a wall, and, after a burst of starry pain, everything went black./\/\/\/\/\"... know what happened but I've sent someone for Pomfrey..."Remus stirred a bit, Lily's voice penetrating the darkness."Is he waking up?" asked an unfamiliar voice."Remus?"He opened his eyes and saw Lily's blurry face hovering over him, very similar to what happened at James's game; only this time the only other person there was an older student he didn't recognize—a tall black boy in a Ravenclaw uniform."Lily?""Oh Remus, you're all right!" Lily crouched down, squeezing his hand. "I came after you and you were laying there bleeding...! I sent a kid to go get Pomfrey but she hasn't shown up yet. I was scared to move you.""Are you feeling all right?" the Ravenclaw asked, his deep voice soothing to Remus. Despite his eyes being rather intense he had a very comforting smile."I... don't know...""What happened? Did someone hex you?"That's when Remus saw the prefect badge pinned on his robes. "No... r-ran into—into w-wall...""Oh, not again!" Lily sighed, shaking her head. "He's rather clumsy."The prefect nodded, crouching down on Remus's other side. "How many fingers am I holding up?""Th—three...""That's a good sign. Lumos." His wand lit up and he bent in, the light shining into Remus's eyes. "His pupils are dilating properly.""Are you going to become a healer?" Lily asked.The Ravenclaw smiled. "No. I intend to become an Auror, actually, but we need to have some medical knowledge.""Is he going to be okay?""I am in no place to judge that, but I think he should—"There were hurried footsteps. "Miss Evans? Mr. Lupin?" he heard Pomfrey say and then, "Mr. Shacklebolt?" The Ravenclaw rose up as Pomfrey approached Remus who was slowly sitting up. "No, Mr. Lupin, stay laying down.""I—I'm fine—"Pomfrey gave him a look, and then summoned a stretcher. "Mr. Shacklebolt, would you please help me?""I'm f-f-fine!" Remus protested as Shacklebolt carefully held Remus by the shoulders. Pomfrey took his legs, and they slid him onto the stretcher. He realized then it was all for show, and relented to being on the stretcher. Pomfrey flicked her wand and the stretcher floated into the air."Do you need me to help you get him to the hospital wing?" Shacklebolt inquired."That would be nice, thank you," Pomfrey agreed."I can come too, right?" Lily asked. Pomfrey nodded before putting a camouflage spell up around them, so other students wouldn't be able to see them and be too nosy.In the hospital wing she and Shacklebolt got Remus onto one of the beds, and Pomfrey thanked the Ravenclaw for all his help. Shacklebolt promised it wasn't any big deal, then, as he turned to leave, he told Remus he hoped he'd make a swift recovery."Miss Evans, could you give us a bit of privacy for a moment?" Pomfrey asked."Oh, yes, of course."Lily waited across the room while Pomfrey shut the curtains. She wanted to know what happened, and Remus replied he had been telling the truth. She seemed confused then he realized he had told Shacklebolt, not her, so he explained again he had tripped and knocked his head into the wall. Pomfrey did a few diagnostic spells but of course he was fine, his lycanthropy had healed him, probably before she even arrived at the scene.Pomfrey opened the curtains. "He'll be fine," she told Lily who jumped up and ran back over. "I've given him potions, and he's already mending.""He doesn't have a concussion?" Lily asked."No, he didn't, so he'll be able to leave soon," Pomfrey said, getting a damp cloth to clean the blood off his face. "Probably in a little bit, half an hour or so."Remus made a face, wanting to leave now but knowing he had to keep up the pretense. At least Lily stayed with him, so he wasn't too bored, although she seemed to blame herself for what happened. He promised it wasn't her fault at all, he had sorta panicked. Lily's face softened, and she apologized for ever mentioning anything in her letter."It's fine," he said as she held his hand tightly. "Honest. I—I d-do. I just... I g-guess I need to... mentally prepare myself.""I don't think it'll be that bad," she teased. "'Unless I'm a horrible kisser."He smiled up at her. "If either of us is, it'll probably be me."She shook her head. "I'm sure you'll be fine." She toyed with his hand, interlacing her fingers with his, unlacing, and weaving them together in another way. "Is it dumb? To be so preoccupied with this?""I dunno." Was it? Should he not even be worrying about having a first kiss yet? He'd be thirteen in less than two months. Course, Sirius didn't get his first kiss until nearly two months after his thirteenth birthday. He wondered when his parents got their first kisses... he knew his father was around his age when he started noticing girls. Ugh, Remus thought, cringing at the memory of The Talk.Lily gave his hand a gentle squeeze. "Right now, you're the only one I'd feel comfortable having one with. But if you don't want to, or change your mind... that's fine, okay?""Yeah, s—same," he agreed, then frowned. "You... d-don't want... it to be with... er, Snape?"Lily lowered her gaze, staring at their hands. "I dunno, he's been kinda weird lately.""Weird?""It's nothing," she said quickly, putting a smile back on her face. "I think sometimes he gets in these moods where it's hard for him to be seen with a Gryffindor.""I'm sorry he gets like that," Remus replied, and Lily shrugged, obviously hurting over it but pretending not to.Her fingers slid out of his, and then she wrapped her hand around his in another way. He was glad he was okay with touch right now, because it felt really nice and comforting to have someone play with his hand like this. Even if she'd be horrified and disgusted if she ever knew that hand turned into a murderous wolf paw... at least he could pretend everything was fine. He wondered if any of the Marauders would do something like this, then wanted to laugh. He doubted they would. It was probably too... weird for them unfortunately. He knew if anyone could see them they'd look at their hands and assume they were a couple. It seemed to be a couple sort of thing to do, but there was nothing romantically intimate about it. It was just hands.His father's voice drifted into his head, from that talk. About holding hands with a girl. It was so ridiculous. He kinda wished he could hold one of his others friends' hands like this. James, or Peter. Or... Sirius... though that might be too awful for everything he was trying to shove back.The thought of holding Sirius's hand definitely felt very different than the thought of holding James's hand, or Peter's hand; or even actually physically holding Lily's hand.They held hands until Pomfrey came back to do another show of diagnostic spells before lecturing him on the importance of paying attention. Finally, though, she let him go and he and Lily headed to supper since it was a good fifteen minutes underway. They parted once through the doors, her going to her girl friends and him going to his guy ones."Where were you?" James asked."Is that blood?" Sirius demanded before Remus could respond.He glanced down. Pomfrey had done some spells to get most of the blood out of his uniform but there were still some spots. "Er, I fell.""Fell?" Peter echoed. "Not attacked?""No! No, I—I tripped and smacked into a wall," he explained, getting food onto his plate. "I had to go to the hospital wing since Lily was with me, and Pomfrey made me stay there for a bit. For show," he added as a quiet explanation.Sirius's eyes bored holes into Remus. "But you're okay?""Embarrassed, but okay," he promised.James smacked his back. "You need to pay attention to where you're going, Brains."That unleashed a flood of teasing which Remus accepted with good nature. He ribbed back, threatening to take James's glasses so he wouldn't be the only one running into things. James gave him the two finger salute then Sirius reached over taking the glasses. James yelped and made a grab for them. Sirius laughed and tried to dive out of reach but instead he wound up flailing and fell off the bench. He held his arm out straight ahead so the glasses didn't hit the floor."That's what you get!" James crowed, swiping the glasses and putting them back on.Sirius lay laughing on the floor, ignoring the looks everyone was giving him. "I shouldn't have done that," he admitted, and James helped him up off the floor. They gave each other elbow nudges to show they weren't annoyed, and returned to their dinners./\/\/\/\/\Tuesday morning Remus wasn't the last one to get out of bed, which was extremely unusual. Instead, Peter remained in bed while everyone else got ready. As the clock ticked forward the Marauders grew worried until Sirius couldn't take it anymore and went to shake him awake. But he was already awake, he just lay curled up in bed."Don't feel too good," he whined."You need to go to Pomfrey?" James asked.Peter mumbled incoherently then wriggled out of bed. "No, I think I'll be okay. Just some cramps or something."Remus frowned, watching him as he shuffled around. The hairs on the back of his neck were raised as he sensed something was wrong. "Are you... sure?" Peter blinked at Remus and slowly nodded. "Okay..." Remus kept fumbling with the knot of the tie then gave up, knowing he'd be getting a few points removed for it not being tidy but not really caring."Here," Sirius said, and began tying the tie. Remus swallowed, keeping his eyes down so he wouldn't have to look up into Sirius's face. Once the tie was done, Sirius gave it a pat. Remus mumbled a thanks, tucking the tie into his jumper and hoping he wasn't red.Throughout the morning Peter kept putting a hand to his stomach, occasionally complaining of the cramps. He didn't eat much for breakfast, nor lunch. He finally agreed to go to Pomfrey after Defense if he still felt bad however half an hour later as they walked to class Pete said he was starting to feel better."S'probably just gas," Pete said."Let her loose!" James laughed, and the others snickered. Then James perked up. "You know what would be fun...?"Remus knew exactly what he wanted, and sighed. "I'll look into it," he promised as James went on to talk about finding a potion or a spell to give someone gas. As they got settled at their desks Remus got his notebook out to add to research, figuring it wouldn't be too difficult; he recalled some spells that might work from when he tried to find a spell that could mimic the sound of someone farting. He shut the book, putting it back in his bag, then steeled himself for another hour and a half of trying to ignore how good Prewett looked and how wobbly he got when Prewett spoke./\/\/\/\/\Remus wasn't sure how Occlumency would go and he hoped Fawley wouldn't ask about the letter. At first she didn't, however one of the first memories they went into was the discussion he and Lily had, and then him panicking and running into a wall. It looked even worse from third person than it had experiencing it firsthand.They left the memory and Fawley's lips pressed thin. He thought she was angry until he noticed her shoulders shaking."M... Miss Fawley...?""I'm s—sorry!" She covered her mouth. "Are you okay? I know you've long since healed up but it seemed very painful."Remus rubbed his forehead where he had made contact with the wall. "It hurt for a second but I pretty much blacked out..."Fawley took in a deep breath, managing to at least not laugh outright. "I was going to bring this up later in the evening... the letter you sent. The advice you needed.""I d-d-don't have feelings for Lily, if that's what you're worried about," Remus stammered out.Fawley gave him a strange look. "I believe you, Remus.""You... do?""Yes. I'm well aware that your friendship with her is just that. I've seen plenty of memories of you making it clear to the other Marauders that's all it is. I'm just... concerned that kissing her might change things."That's the point, he thought bitterly, tugging at his sleeve. "Not between us," he reassured her."I don't know Miss Evans very well, except what I've seen through you, however what I'm about to say goes for both of you. You don't need to rush anything. You're both only twelve—well, I know you'll be thirteen soon—and you both have plenty of time ahead of you. That being said... I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with having your first kiss be with just a friend, if it is something you want to just get out of the way. But... there's also really nothing wrong waiting until you get someone special in your life."Remus squirmed in his seat. "I won't, though," he whispered."What?""I—I won't. Get someone special. I—I know I can't. Because of what I am. Cause it means either lying to a girl which sounds really wrong, or else her knowing, and nobody would want to date me," he said, the words tumbling out rather quickly. Words he felt strange admitting out loud... yet ones he wanted to say.One he sorta wanted her to dismiss but knew she wouldn't."That is a very good, mature view of looking at things," Fawley said. "As I said in my letter, this is something you need to be cautious about. Dating is... next to impossible for werewolves. Very few people would willingly get into a relationship with one. And it isn't something you can exactly disclose on a first date, as it needs to be kept absolutely secret.""I... w-won't be able to date," he said, a floaty sort of ache drifting inside of his chest."It would not be very safe," she agreed.Even though he knew this to be true it still hurt hearing it spoken out loud by someone not him. Maybe all this determination to like girls was just a moot point. Nothing could come of it. But... he still wanted to be as normal as a werewolf boy could be, and that meant liking girls."Then... it might be a g-good thing," he said slowly after several seconds of silence. "Um, k—kissing her, I mean. It's not something... I could ever really do. With someone who likes me like that."Fawley sighed. "It's your decision, Remus. If you are absolutely certain nothing will come of it, and you both feel you want to just get your first kiss over with then by all means go for it."The rest of the evening went decently. He managed the paper towel barrier pretty much every time, even as his head started hurting. He hadn't really managed to ever keep it up the entire time, and he left feeling a mixture of being proud of himself, and anxious over the whole kissing thing.

Author's note: Some body horror/gore in this chapter, also brief discussion of medical issues/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Having the full moon starting on a Wednesday wasn't as much as a sleep-in opportunity as Saturday or Sunday, but at least Remus didn't need to wake up right away. He woke up at around eight-thirty then drifted back into sleep only to be awoken a little over an hour later. He heard his friends getting ready and debated getting out of bed, getting ready. Class didn't start till eleven. He could just skip breakfast and eat lunch..."Remus?" James called."I'll be down for class," Remus yawned. His curtains were pulled back and he squinted at the light, putting his arm over his eyes. "Noo!" he whined."You okay?" James asked, bending over Remus."I'll be down for class," he said again. "I'll eat lunch.""You look awful," Peter said, peering around James's shoulder.Sirius finally spoke up. "Oh, right, it's...""Uh-huh," Remus mumbled."Already?" James asked, sounding surprised."Mmhmm." Remus buried his head under his pillow."Right. Er—sorry, see you in class...""Yeah, I'll be down for class."The curtains shut, and he heard them leave. It didn't take long for him to fall back into sleep... and sleep... and sleep...Until he was awoken again. This time it was Sirius standing over him, shaking him. "Remus!" he hissed."I said I'll see you in class!" Remus complained, swatting at Sirius's hands."You mean Charms? Which is over?"Remus bolted upright, nearly banging his head into Sirius's face. "What!? No, it's only—" He looked over at the clock and saw with horror it was twelve pm. "What?!" He grabbed his clock and checked the alarm. It was working? "Oh, oh blast it, I must have been in really deep sleep, I—I missed class?!""Yeah," Sirius said, sitting down next to him. "There's nothing wrong with—""Nothing wrong!?" Remus screeched causing Sirius to flinch. "No! No, you—you d-don't understand! I can't miss class! I can't!" He scrambled out of bed, as if getting dressed quickly would magically turn the clock back an hour. "I can't.""Remus—"He yanked his uniform out of the wardrobe and the fabric slid from his shaky fingers. "I c-can't—""Remus!" Sirius came over, picking up the clothes. "Calm down. It's okay."Remus shook his head, feeling sick, feeling dread consuming him. "It's not. I'm already missing so many classes I can't miss more!""You look really bad today...""So?" Remus glanced towards the mirror and now it was his turn to flinch. He looked really bad. As bad as he had back in September when his health sparked the fight with James. He reached up, pushing back some of his limp hair.Sirius took his shoulders, turning him back to face him. "Maybe you should skip History too," he suggested softly. "You're going to have to miss Transfiguration, right?" Remus slowly nodded. "Then skip History. Just, go wherever you go and get some more sleep?""I can't...""History—if there's any class you can skip without missing anything it's History," Sirius pointed out, his grip softening. "You obviously need the sleep.""I can't let it take over," Remus whispered, taking his clothes back from Sirius. "I can't let it win.""Let... it win? Let what win?"He looked around even though he knew Spinnet and Struthers weren't around. "The curse." He twisted his jumper in his hands, fingers digging into the wool. "Missing classes like this is... allowing it to... win."Sirius gave him a rather worried look. "I—I don't think it works like that, mate.""It's how I feel.""Is that why you come to class after the moon, when you should still be healing up?"Remus scowled at that and then turned away. "I'll see you at lunch. Thank you for waking me up.""Remus—"But he was leaving the dorm, heading into the bathroom to get ready. He brushed his teeth, staring miserably at his reflection; at the dark smudges under his eyes that made him look like someone punched him. Exhaustion tugged at every fiber of his being, every last bit of bone, and he wanted nothing more than to go back to sleep. And Sirius was right. History was an easy class to miss. As long as he knew which pages Binns read from he'd be good to go.Remus spat the potion out in the sink and rinsed his mouth out. Not going to class on purpose... well, he had skipped History before... plus he missed Charms, and he'd be unable to go to Transfiguration anyway.Then he realized how stupid he was being. He couldn't go to History anyway! The sun set shortly after four, which meant he needed to be there by two, two-thirty. History started at two.He returned to his dorm, nearly running into Sirius who was still there."Si—"Sirius grabbed his arms. "Okay, Remus, listen.""But—""Listen! I think you should skip class, to get some extra rest.""Siri—""I know you don't want to but—but you need to think about your health!""Siri—""I know you heal howevermmph!"Remus put his hand against Sirius's mouth to shut him up. "I have to skip class anyway," he said, a shiver going through his body at the feel of Sirius's lips against his hand. More than a shiver... a buzzy sort of thrilled feeling that electrified him in ways he absolutely should not be feeling, practically taking his breath away. He quickly yanked his hand away, and wiped it off on his trousers before going over to get some casual clothes.For some reason he thought of the conversation with Fawley, about not being able to date anyone and how awful that felt. Although he really had zero interest in dating at the moment, it was more of the fact it was yet another thing separating him from everyone else. But still, why randomly think about that at this moment?"You do?""Sunset is at four. I have to leave by two. I wasn't even thinking. I kept thinking it's at four so I'll miss Transfiguration, but I have to leave so early I'll miss History too." This time he slipped behind his curtains to change, yanking on jeans and a baggy jumper. "Could you tell the others—I mean, Lily and them—that I got a note saying my mother's very ill?""You don't want us to visit you?"Remus froze in the middle of buttoning his jeans. He hadn't thought of that. "Er. I mean, I—I'd like it if you could but... I can't use my own illness as an excuse so often." He finished buttoning them and then slid out of bed to search for his trainers. "I can't raise suspicion."Sirius watched him bustle around, arms folded. "Yeah," he agreed, sounding sad. "Maybe we can sneak in under the cloak."Remus shoved some pajamas in his satchel before remembering he wouldn't be staying during the day. "That could be dangerous," he pointed out then opened up one of his drawers, pulling out Peter's blanket and Sirius's box. He folded the blanket up and managed to squash it into the box, and put the box in his bag; he also slipped in one of his old paperbacks that he wouldn't be too heartbroken if it got torn up."So, we don't get to see you till Saturday?" Sirius asked.Remus shouldered his bag and turned, looking up at Sirius. "I'm sorry, but... I have to vary my excuses about being missing." He pushed his hair back, wishing it could be different.Sirius nodded. "Yeah, I get that. Maybe we'll try anyway.""No... if—if you get caught then they'd know you know I'm in there," he said."Fine. Yeah. Saturday, then." Sirius sounded absolutely miserable now, and began kicking at the ground. "I'll let Evans know."They stared at each other for a few seconds then Remus ducked his head. "See you Saturday. Least I'll be back for Pete's birthday."Sirius reached out, tousling Remus's hair. "Yes, we're definitely going to have a big birthday celebration for him."Remus smiled and then left, hurrying down through the nearly empty common room—everyone was at lunch—and out into the halls. He took back routes to the hospital wing, but Pomfrey wasn't there. James's cousin—Professor Shafiq—was and Remus muttered he needed to talk to Pomfrey. Shafiq told him she'd be back later, and asked if there was anything she could help with. Remus shook his head and took a seat, waiting with apprehension. Shafiq continued about her work, casting curious glances at Remus as she did so.Finally, though, Pomfrey showed up. She sent Shafiq out to do something then put a cloak over Remus to help disguise him as they made their way out of the school. After Pomfrey took him all the way to the house he informed her he had told his friends his mother was ill. She nodded, promising she'd back the claim if any of his friends showed up. Remus didn't think they would. Hoped they wouldn't.She left him alone and he went upstairs, putting his bag on the ground and kicking his shoes off. He flopped into the bed which gave a rather ominous creaking sound. It was already falling apart. Ugh.He wanted to read, however sleep soon pulled him in. Thankfully, though, he woke up before sunset. He stripped off, putting all his clothes in the battered wardrobe, then opened his satchel to get Peter's blanket out. It was very soft and so comfy. Remus wrapped it around himself then took his book and Sirius's box down to the living room. He folded part of the blanket over his lap and set the box there, opening the book above it. It was a little weird to read this way but not too uncomfortable. The only thing was he wasn't sure how things would go... of course, he wasn't sure if he'd be transforming or not; he knew the weather report called for snow.Sunset came and he remained a boy. He shifted around and curled up more on the couch, wrapping the blanket tighter around him. It didn't keep all of the chill out, however it kept him at least decently warm.After a little while he put the book in the box and shut it. He had already fixed it with the password, and it wouldn't open unless he spoke the password. Hopefully he couldn't get into it as a wolf.Remus tugged the blanket closer and began drifting into uneasy sleep... until he felt the moon pulling at him. He fell off the couch and began writhing as the moon dragged the wolf out./\/\/\/\/\A scream tore through the air, turning into heavy pants as the wolf shrank back into Remus, and he lay broken and bleeding on the floor. He twisted around a bit then pushed himself into a sitting position, taking in deep gulps of air as he surveyed the damage. It wasn't anywhere near as bad as his last night in Hogsmeade. His legs were a bit shredded, and both his arms were shredded. His right thumb had been almost gnawed off. He reached over, carefully prodding at the twitching thumb. A jolt of pain shot through his arm and he hissed.Slowly he got up, limping into the bathroom. He glanced over to where the blackboard used to be before turning the shower on and climbing in. The hot water hurt his wounds and he sank down onto the floor, curling up, staring at his ruined thumb as blood swirled down the drain.He faded in and out of consciousness until Pomfrey showed up; once he heard her voice he forced himself to get up, turning the shower off and getting a towel around himself."Th—this is the w-worst injury," Remus muttered, holding out his hand.Pomfrey examined the wound, carefully wrapping bandages around it to keep it in place. She put a few other bandages on his body then helped him into hospital pajamas. Once they got back to the hospital she slathered some potion on his thumb to help encourage it to heal quickly, though of course it wouldn't. The potion would be rejected by his DNA, or something like that. After she was satisfied with the mound of goop she put fresh bandages on and a splint as well, just in case.After a chocolate shake Remus fell asleep, drifting in and out until around noon when he heard familiar voices out in the wing. No! he thought, heart hammering hard. No, you're not supposed to be coming here! He slithered out of bed and limped to the door, listening in, curious what they'd tell Pomfrey."What do you three need?" Pomfrey demanded. "Mr. Lupin isn't here, he's visiting his mother. I'd assume you would know that.""We know," James said. "It's Pete, he's not feeling well.""Oh. I see. Well, come over here, sit down. Where does it hurt?"Peter gave a low moan. "My stomach.""What did you eat for breakfast?""Ummm... beans on toast, and juice, I wasn't really hungry..."Remus heard Pomfrey do some spells. "Hmm, I don't see anything wrong—would you two stop that?" she snapped, as Remus heard something crashing. James and Sirius giggled. "Did you—" Now Peter was giggling too, and something else hit the floor. James went 'oops' while Pomfrey sighed. "Perhaps you're having stomach cramps? Are you sure it's your stomach?""Yes, it's not super bad but it's... annoying...""You're sure it's not anywhere else?""Only my stomach.""Not down here?""Ummmm... no. Definitely stomach."Pomfrey gave a hmph sound as there was another crashing sound. "Here, take this. It should help with your stomachache. If you still have it tomorrow, please come back.""Th—thank you..."Remus returned to his bed, gnawing at his fingernails, worried about Pete; he hadn't been feeling well the other day, and Remus could sense something was wrong... only he didn't know what. Gas? Stomach cramps? It couldn't be worse or Pomfrey would have found it... right?/\/\/\/\/\A couple hours after lunch Remus returned to his house. He was feeling pretty decent so he spent quite some time trying to clean up the blood. Or at least, that was his intention. After about two minutes he remembered the blanket and ran over to where it was bunched up on the floor. He took the corners and spread it out.It was completely intact!Remus's jaw dropped a bit. There was blood smeared all over it, soaked into the fabric, however it was not ripped at all. He couldn't even find a snagged thread. Bless you, Petey, he thought, clutching the blanket close. After a moment he went in search of Sirius's box. That he found clear in the kitchen which made it obvious the wolf had messed with it. But, like the blanket, there was nary a scratch."Mellon," he said, and the box unlatched. The paperback was pretty banged up, definitely in worse condition than it was when he put it in—he'd need to cushion the inside which wasn't a big deal. This meant he could sit there and read until his transformation took over! He'd easily have time to drop the book in and shut the box, and it would stay safe.I love my friends, he thought, hugging the box and blanket tightly, and thinking about the earplugs. He curled up on the couch and wept for a little bit. Eventually, he wiped his face off and started cleaning once more, trying—and failing—to get the blood off the floor./\/\/\/\/\Thursday night was one of no transformation, and when Pomfrey took him back to the school there was glittering snow everywhere, deep enough that it went past Remus's boots; Pomfrey had to use some drying spells on the bottoms of his pajamas when they got back to the hospital. He slept for most of the morning, occasionally reading a bit, hoping it would snow again that night. It'd be great if he could come back tomorrow morning and go right to classes—tired, but not so injured he'd miss more."Did—did Peter come back?" he asked when Pomfrey brought his lunch. "I heard him out there yesterday, with a hurt stomach?""They haven't shown up," she said, setting the tray down on his lap. "I'm sure he's fine. He probably ate a lot. Which you need to do too.""Yes Madame Pomfrey, thank you."Remus went through two and a half helpings before growing too tired to eat anymore. Pomfrey seemed quite pleased./\/\/\/\/\Unfortunately for Remus, it didn't snow again that night, and an hour or two after sunset he felt it coming. He was sitting on the couch with the box and his book in his lap when suddenly he began to feel the pull. He did what Sirius had suggested, and it worked: drop the book into the box (lined with pillowcases now) and slam it shut. He managed to move it onto the couch when the wolf began to push itself through his skin. Screaming in pain, Remus collapsed to the floor however this time it took a long time for the wolf brain to take over. He was very aware as every inch of him began changing and hurting, parts splitting, pushing through his skin, tearing, teeth growing and piercing his lips... it felt like an eternity until the wolf mind took over, and everything went black./\/\/\/\/\Not... so bad... Remus thought come morning when he was aware once more. There were giant claw marks gashed into his left forearm, and an even worse one on his left shoulder that extended across part of his neck: skin torn, muscles exposed, pain searing through his body. That seemed to be the worst of the injuries today; everything else was just smaller gashes and bites. The shoulder-neck wound made it difficult to breathe, and he wheezed as he stumbled to the bathroom. In the hall he doubled over, coughing up some blood into his hand. All right, maybe it was worse than he thought.He had difficulty getting the shower turned on, as his vision kept blurring and darkening. Finally, he managed to get the hot water running and he curled up on the shower floor, shivering and wheezing until Pomfrey showed up."You need to stop getting in the shower, it causes more blood loss!" she snapped when she got him out to start bandaging up."W—w-wash... b-blood off..." he whimpered.Pomfrey's expression softened. "The best thing to do is spot clean, with a damp towel. Water pouring into your wounds makes it worse. Honestly, I have no idea where you even got that this is a good idea."Remus thought of home, of every single morning after when his parents would put him in a bathtub full of water. "I'm f—fine.""You've got a terrible fever." She pressed her hand against his forehead. "Let's get you back so you can rest.""Will I be—be able to go to the afternoon c—" Remus was forced to stop, to try to take in some oxygen. "Afternoon classes?" he finished.Pomfrey gave him the strangest of looks. "We'll see," she said, and helped him back to the school.He was unable to even get down half the shake because it hurt to swallow. Pomfrey sighed, but didn't push him to drink anymore, leaving him to sleep which took a little bit due to trying to find a comfortable position. He drifted in and out of sleep, trying to ignore the fact he was missing classes again. So many missed this week. Well, only one extra, technically. Hopefully he'd be able to go to some afternoon classes!Then it hit him. Pomfrey's confused look. It was Saturday, not Friday. He didn't have classes. Well, guess I don't need to feel so guilty resting then, he thought, and fell back asleep.When Pomfrey brought him lunch he asked if he could go back to his dorm after, however she told him the wound on his neck was still bad enough she'd prefer him to stay. He prodded at the bandages, flinching at the pain it caused. Pomfrey glared at him."It is Saturday, right?" he asked as he picked up his fork."Yes."He managed to get down at least a full plate of food. It didn't hurt quite as much as it did earlier, thankfully. Pomfrey whisked the tray away and Remus snuggled back to go back to sleep...Until a cry of pain woke him. He sat upright, hissing at the pain jerking his arm had caused. The pained cries in the hospital wing grew louder. Somebody wasn't having a good day. Remus started to lay back down when he realized he recognized the person crying.He leapt out of bed, grabbing a sheet to wrap around his shoulders to hide the bandages on his neck, then ran out of the little room, not even thinking—not even caring."Calm down, you need to lay still so I can examine you!"Pomfrey was standing over a bed where Peter lay thrashing and howling in pain. James and Sirius stood next to him, terrified expressions on their face."Peter?!" Remus gasped out. Everyone looked at him, Pomfrey giving him a rather dark look. "Peter, what—what happened?""His stomach started hurting worse," James explained."It HURTS!" Peter yelled, clutching at his middle, rolling back and forth which prevented Pomfrey from being able to get her wand where it needed to be. "It hurts it hurts it hurts!""Please lay still...!"Sirius put his hands on Peter's shoulders. "C'mon, Petey, you need to lay still so she can help you.""Here," James said, and took one of Peter's hands. "You can squeeze my hand."Remus ran around to the other side of the bed and took Peter's other hand. "Squeeze as hard as you need to."With the Marauders helping, Peter managed to lay still, squeezing James and Remus's hands tightly. Tears rolled down the sides of his face as he whimpered and sniffled, while Pomfrey ran a few spells."You'll be fine," she said, when she was done, however there was a tightness to her voice. She went over to a cupboard and pulled out a vial of potion. "This will help ease the pain. Now, I'll be right back with some other medicine to help."Peter stopped wriggling as much once the potion took effect, but he kept holding on to his friends' hands. "It still hurts," he mumbled."What happened?" Remus whispered."He's been feeling unwell for a few days," James said. "He was in a lot of pain this morning and I think he had a fever, but said he'd be okay, but after lunch he started screaming like this.""I'm dying," Peter said."What? Don't be stupid, you're not dying," Sirius snorted, hands still on Peter's shoulders, more of a comforting manner than a holding down manner now."I am dying!" he moaned, tipping his head back."She said you'd be fine," Remus tried."What if I'm not fine?!" Peter demanded."If you weren't fine she would have summoned Dumbledore," James pointed out, pushing his glasses up.Peter pouted but then quieted, returning to his whimpers.Two minutes later the doors to the hospital wing opened, and in came Professor Dumbledore. All four Marauders stared in horror as he crossed the wing and knocked at Pomfrey's door. Peter made choking sounds, and squeezed Remus's hand so tightly it hurt."H—hold on," Remus said, getting his hand free as Dumbledore went into Pomfrey's office. He hurried across the floor, hovering near enough to catch a few words."... emergency... Mungo's... his parents..." And then Pomfrey gave what sounded like a cry, her voice rising. "I should have been more alert when he came in the other day, I wasn't thinking. He insisted the pain was only in his stomach, he didn't have a fever or anything, and the others were distracting me. I wasn't as thorough as I should have been!"Remus covered his mouth, feet rooted to the floor, trying to keep the bile back. He also tried not to look scared as he returned to Peter's bedside but they could all tell something was wrong. "I'm—I'm n-not sure," he lied, taking Peter's hand again.Pomfrey and Dumbledore came out of her office, both with pleasant smiles on their faces. Remus grit his teeth as Peter squeezed his hand so hard it felt like his bones might break."I'm dying!" Peter screeched as soon as they neared the bed."You're not dying," Pomfrey said, resting a hand on his arm. "You'll be fine—""Why is—is P-Professor Dumbledore here, then?!" he demanded."Peter," Dumbledore said in a very kind voice, "you're going to have to go to Saint Mungo's for the night. I've sent a message to your parents so they will be there when you arrive."Peter froze, mouth hanging open slightly. "Wh... wha... wh...""It will be fine," Pomfrey promised. "You have appendicitis.""Appenda... what?""Appendicitis. Your appendix is severely inflamed," Pomfrey explained. "I wish I had caught it earlier otherwise we could have gotten it healed up without any issue... however, considering the state it's in you will need to go to Saint Mungo's to have it removed.""HAVE WHAT REMOVED?!" Peter shrieked."Your appendix.""WHAT IS THAT?! Re—removed? What do you mean removed?! From my body?!""Yes," Pomfrey answered patiently. "It's safe to have it taken out, it's a very common procedure. I'm not capable of doing it here in the school hospital, which is why you need to go to Saint Mungo's. It won't take long, and you'll be back here by tomorrow."Peter was shaking hard. "Wh—what if—but—tomorrow?""Yes, ninety-five percent of patients recover within twelve to twenty-four hours.""What... about the—the other five percent?" Peter squeaked.Pomfrey shook her head. "As I said, it's extremely common. Even Muggles have a procedure to remove an inflamed appendix! It needs to be done immediately, as I think yours is about to rupture and you need it out before that happens.""Rupture?!"The doors to the wing opened and a man and a woman came in. "Ah, here they are now, they're from Saint Mungo's," Pomfrey said, patting Peter's arm."I DON'T WANT TO GO! I don't WANT anything removed! No!" He clutched James and Remus's hands tightly, pushing himself back up against Sirius as he began sobbing. "No! Please, I—can—can they come with me?""I'm afraid not," Dumbledore said. "However your parents will be there.""It'll be fine," James said, bending in close to Peter, sliding his other hand onto Peter's upper arm. "I've had a couple relatives have their appendix... appendixes... removed.""I had it done," Sirius said, crouching a bit to be closer to Peter's head, resting his hand on Peter's head."You... did?""Yes, when I was ten," Sirius said, stroking Peter's hair. "My cousin had an inflamed appendix too, but they caught it early enough to get it fixed without issue. Mine was worse. It did rupture. I had to go to Saint Mungo's to get it removed and cleaned out, and that part wasn't anything bad. All they do is put you to sleep and then you wake up, and it's fine.""Promise?""Promise.""I d... I'm scared...""That's okay," James said. "Nothing wrong with being scared, and your parents will be there.""And we'll be here tomorrow when you come back, healthy again," Remus promised, wrapping both hands around Peter's hand."Come on, kiddo, we need to get you to the hospital," said one of the healers.The Marauders helped Peter out of bed, and, with one last terrified look over his shoulder, Pete left for Saint Mungo's. James, Sirius, and Remus stood there watching him go, all three holding hands.

James, Sirius, and Remus stood by the empty bed, staring at the closed doors for several long seconds. They were holding hands, with Sirius in the middle, completely lost and when Dumbledore spoke, they all jumped."Don't worry, he'll be fine.""Yeah," James said, letting go of Sirius's hand. "He'll be back tomorrow, right?""Yes, of course," Pomfrey promised.Remus realized he was still holding Sirius's hand and he let go, but Sirius still held his hand and continued to do so. Then he realized he wasn't even supposed to be there. Of course the Marauders knew he would be, however Pomfrey and Dumbledore didn't—and couldn't—know they knew!"I—I guess I should explain what I'm doing here," Remus said.James and Sirius both looked at him, and understanding dawned in Sirius's face. "What are you doing here?" he asked, sounding genuinely confused. "I thought you were visiting your mother!"Remus searched his brain for a plausible explanation. "I was... she's doing better. A lot better. I—I was going to come back yesterday but—but I began to not feel too well." He shifted a bit, wishing Sirius would let go of him. "I was going to stay home till I felt better, but it wasn't as bad as it normally gets, and I didn't want to be in the way—didn't want Dad taking care of both of us since it's hard on him—so I came back here last night."Both his friends nodded. "Glad your mum's better," James said with a smile, "but sorry you're not doing well.""I'm starting to feel better today already," he promised. "I might be able to come back to the dorms tomorrow morning, or even tonight. I should have been resting but I heard Peter screaming and got scared.""You need to go rest," Sirius said, and used the fact he had a grip on Remus's hand to turn him towards the door to his room, giving him a gentle push.At least he had let go of Remus's hand. "Yeah. Um, I'll see you later..." He hurried back to his room, wishing his friends could come too. He was so worried about Peter and didn't want to sit and fret alone. Surely Peter would be okay! It was a routine procedure. Sirius had it done at ten. Pete would be fine... right?Remus asked Pomfrey when she came into his room a little while later. She promised him Peter would be fine. "It hadn't ruptured yet, so the recovery rate is extremely high," she said."A ruptured appendix isn't?" he asked."No," she said hesitantly. "It complicates the process greatly, and there is a risk of—of death. However Peter's appendix was not ruptured."But Remus was thinking of Sirius, and the fact Sirius's appendix had ruptured, and why it had gotten to the point where it did; hadn't his parents taken him to Saint Mungo's when he was in a lot of pain...? "Why does it take so long to recover?" he asked."Really, he'll be healed up within an hour or two after they remove his appendix," Pomfrey said with a smile. "He needs to remain in the hospital for observation, to make sure everything went well. I'm certain he'll be back at school by lunch tomorrow, or supper.""It's his birthday tomorrow," Remus said, not sure even why he said it."Oh! Well, he'll be back. What we need to talk about is the fact you ran out there..."Remus shrank back a bit, fiddling with the blanket. "Ahh. When I heard Pete shouting I p-panicked, I got scared and ran out without thinking. I did cover my bandages so they didn't see... I think they believed my excuse though."Pomfrey nodded. "Yes, it seems that they did, thankfully. Please be more cautious in the future.""Yes Madame Pomfrey. And—and Pete will be okay?""Yes."Remus stayed in the hospital wing for a while longer, unable to rest at all due to worry over Pete. He knew Peter would be all right however he couldn't help feel an icicle of dread trickling down his spine. Finally he couldn't stand being alone a second longer and changed into his clothes. He stared at his reflection, tugging at his jumper this way and that. No matter what he did, the jumper's neck hole was too big and you could see the bandages across his neck."Madame Pomfrey?" He tapped at her door, not wanting to bother her but not sure what to do. "I'm feeling a—a lot better but..." He reached up, tugging at the neckline."I see. Perhaps you should wait...""I—I really... don't want to. I—I have a jumper that'll cover it, but I was wondering if I could... borrow a scarf or something? To get to the dorms?""Of course," Pomfrey said, and fetched a pale grey scarf which Remus wrapped around his neck. He thanked her profusely before heading out, casting one last look at the bed Peter had been in.Remus mostly took back corridors to get to the common room, avoiding as many people as possible. He scurried through the tower, up the stairs, and into his room which was quite empty. Breathing a sigh of relief, he dug through his trunk until he found the top he was looking for. It was a rather large cream-colored cable knit turtleneck jumper his mother had bought for him. It was so big he never even bothered wearing it, though he figured it would fit him well enough next winter. Hopefully.Cocking his head to listen for anyone coming in, he quickly shed the jumper he had been wearing and pulled the turtleneck one on. It felt so bulky. However it covered his neck, and the bulkiness only aided in keeping the bandages on his throat, shoulder, and arm hidden. He had to push the sleeves way up to get his hands out the end, and the hem of the jumper went well past his hips. His mother had... a lot of hope for his height, which he wanted to fulfill.Next, Remus took the box out of his bag. Peter's blanket had stayed at the house for the time being, though he considered bringing it in to see if the house-elves could get the blood out. Of course, what would be the point in that, when it would get bloody next time?"Mellon," he said, and took the book out. He shut the box and tucked it into his trunk.Remus put his pranks notebook into his satchel along with a few schoolbooks, and headed out of his dorm to go search for his friends. The other students he questioned in the common room had no clue where they had gone, so it seemed he would need to take a few guesses. If that failed, he figured he'd go study in the library.His first guess, however, turned out to be right. He went into the passageway with the pits and heard their voices."Oi!" he called out, and their voices went silent as he inched along the thin ledge that took him across the first hole. "It's Remus.""Remy?" A second later James flew over the impassable hole. "You're out already!"Remus got on the broom and they flew back over where Sirius was. Sirius gave him a rather strange look, which made Remus feel a bit self-conscious. He tugged at the bulky jumper, and set his bag down."I didn't want to be alone," he explained. "Pete..."James's face fell. "I know what you mean. All I can do is worry. I mean, I know he's safe but... it's so scary. What if something happens?""Saint Mungo's is an excellent hospital," Sirius murmured, glancing out the side of his eyes at Remus."I'm f—fine," Remus stammered, thinking perhaps it was how awful he looked that was causing the stares."Huh?""You keep looking at me."To his surprise, Sirius flushed a little. "Yeah, of course. That's not... um, anyway, I don't think you've ever worn that."Remus looked down, hand brushing against the stomach of the jumper. "No, it's too big for me. I know it looks dumb but it was the only thing I have that covers the bandages.""Bandages?" James asked.He made a face then pulled at the neck a little so they could see. "I hurt my neck pretty bad.""Should you be out of the hospital wing?" James asked, surprisingly being the one concerned and not Sirius, however Sirius was still giving Remus odd looks."Yes, I'm all right. Mostly worried about Peter.""Oh!" James snapped his fingers. "By the way, we had an idea. Okay, I know you're going to say no, but at least hear me out."Remus narrowed his eyes. "What rule does it break?"James gave one of his Potter smiles. "What makes you think it involves breaking a rule?" Remus folded his arms and raised an eyebrow. "Okay, okay, sneaking out of the school, but—""No.""—I propose we sneak into Hogsmeade—""No.""—and go to Saint Mungo's!" James looked at him now with an even bigger grin, and a flourish of his arms as if to magnify his 'amazing' idea.Remus sighed. "No!""But—""James, if we get caught at Saint Mungo's there will be hell to pay!" Remus felt itchy, and wanted to push his hands up the sleeves to scratch. He had too much anxiety at the moment to even fathom such a disaster of a plan. Not only was it utterly stupid, absolutely reckless, and beyond careless... if his parents found out... they would move to a different country in a heartbeat. It was idiotic enough going into Hogsmeade... but Saint Mungo's?"We could surprise Peter in the morning," Sirius said.Remus sank down to the floor, huddled against the wall. "He's—he's coming back in the afternoon...""For his birthday though," James said, clapping. "It'd be a nice surprise."Be a nice surprise for my parents, getting a letter saying I was caught at Saint Mungo's. "I would love nothing more than to show up as a happy birthday surprise for Pete, however I absolutely will not do that, it is too risky." He pulled his hands into the sleeves so the ends dangled. He began flapping them, smacking the ends against the floor. "We should set up a surprise for when he comes back. Decorate the dorm. Make cake...!" He jerked his chin up, smiling. "Let's make him a cake. Ourselves. That would be very special. We could ask McGonagall if we could use the kitchens.""That'd be kinda fun," James mumbled.Sirius tilted his head. "You know how to bake?""No..." He sat upright, a memory popping into his head. "But I know who does!"/\/\/\/\/\"Bake?" Lily glanced up, pressing her book against her chin, eyes darting between the three Marauders suspiciously. "Why d'you want to bake a cake?""For Peter," Remus said. "It's his birthday tomorrow and..." He wasn't sure if he was supposed to share what happened, except Lily could keep a secret. So he sat down and explained.Lily gasped, clutching her book tightly as her eyes went very wide. "Oh no! That's dreadful! He's going to be okay though, right? Poor Peter! And—his birthday too. Yes, of course I'll help. Um, are we even allowed to do that though?""We're gonna ask McGonsie," Sirius said, squeezing into the armchair Remus was in. It was just barely big enough for them, and they were pressed up together which definitely wasn't ideal for the box situation. He tried his best to stay calm, and ignored the fact his palms were getting very sweaty. He pulled his hands back up into his sleeves, pressing them against the wool. Sirius didn't seem bothered at all being squashed together. "See if we can use the kitchen."James sat down on the arm of the chair Lily was in, ignoring the glare she gave him. "Should we bake it tonight, or tomorrow morning?""Probably tonight, it will store overnight fine," Lily said, closing her book. "What's his favorite kind of cake?"All three of them spoke at the same time."Chocolate," Sirius said."Lemon?" Remus asked."Battenberg!" James suggested.They looked at each other, and Lily put her hand to her face. "Okay then," she sighed."Er, he likes all sorts," James said, trying to lean back against the back of the chair without touching Lily. "I'm not sure of his favorite though.""He does like sponge cakes though," Sirius said."All right, what about a Victoria sponge?" Lily suggested, and Sirius shrugged."I'm pretty sure he'd like that," Remus said, trying to remember what desserts Peter ate. "Maybe we could make some biscuits too. He loves iced biscuits. I can make biscuits."Lily tapped her chin. "All right, we can do that. You're sure he likes sponge cakes?""Yes," Sirius and James chorused while Remus nodded."We should go talk to McGonagall," James said, and hopped off the chair.The four of them headed out of the common room which was very bizarre to Remus. James, Sirius, and Lily... working together. This was going to be really weird. Hopefully they'd be able to get along well enough for the baking part. He really wanted something super special for Pete to come back to, and also a reason for the others not to sneak into the hospital!Professor McGonagall wasn't in her office, so they had to hunt her down which took the better part of half an hour. Eventually they ran across Sir Nicholas, one of Remus's ghost friends, who gladly helped. He tracked her down to the teacher's lounge, floating through the wall to get her. She came out, lips thin as she surveyed the group before her."Did something happen?""Professor, what makes you automatically think something happened?" James asked.She looked down her nose at him. "Because typically if I'm seeing you outside of class, you've done something!"Sirius stepped forward, pushing some of his hair back, one of his charming smiles spreading on his face. "Professor, I'm guessing Professor Dumbledore told you about what happened with Peter?" he inquired, and McGonagall nodded. Sirius launched into a big explanation of what they wanted to do for him. Remus could see McGonagall's face softening as he spoke, until she had one of her rare smiles."That would be very nice of you. Are any of you acquainted with baking magic?"All four of them shook their heads, and Remus's heart sank as he realized they'd probably have to get the house-elves to make it, which... would be all right, just not quite as special."I can bake the Muggle way," Lily said, folding her hands demurely in front of her. "If there's any way to get Muggle baking tools we can do that.""Wait, bake the Muggle way?!" Remus heard Sirius whisper fearfully to James."Actually, we have plenty of Muggle cooking utensils at Hogwarts," McGonagall said, surprising them. "While the house-elves mostly use magic, Professor Lewis—who teaches Muggle Studies—will have Muggle cooking or baking lessons. I'll speak to her, and I'm sure she'll be glad to lend what she has. Mr. Pettigrew should be back tomorrow afternoon, will tomorrow morning be all right for you?""Yes, Professor!" James said excitedly, then stopped. "Oh. I have—I have practice in the morning."Would you be able to bake after?" McGonagall asked."It'll be lunchtime, and the house-elves will be busy," James said."You won't be bothering the house-elves," she said. "There's enough room, it should be fine.""Really?" James asked, and McGonagall nodded. "Okay, great! Tomorrow it is."/\/\/\/\/\The Marauders didn't do much else that evening, mostly hung out in their dorm trying not to be too worried about Peter. At around eight a prefect came up and told them McGonagall needed to see them. They went down to the common room, extremely scared and anxious until they saw her smile. She pulled them into a corner, and informed them Dumbledore had heard back from Saint Mungo's; the procedure had gone without a hitch—and that's all she got out before James let out a whoop and hugged McGonagall. She staggered back, pure shock filling her face as he hugged her. Sirius pumped his fists, jumping up and down, while Remus clapped and pumped one fist too.Several students were watching James hugging their Head of House with amusement. None of them had heard what was said to trigger the hug, of course.McGonagall gave James a pat and he peeled himself off of her. She straightened her glasses and finished what she was saying, which was that Peter was okay, he was recovering well, and he'd be back before supper tomorrow, probably right after lunch.That night, Spinnet and Struthers were curious where Peter was—Spinnet even asked nicely—and James told them that Peter was in the hospital. He didn't specify whether it was the hospital wing or Saint Mungo's, and later that night he told Sirius and Remus he wasn't sure what Peter wanted people to know. Sirius and Remus agreed that was for the best.The three of them stayed up late in the common room, wrapping presents for Peter while listening to music. James and Sirius danced a lot and tried to get Remus to dance too but he shook his head. Sirius offered his hand which was... very tempting for Remus to take. Instead, he shook his head again and tugged down the turtleneck."My shoulder still hurts," he said, and let the neck spring back up, glad to have an excuse."Ohhh, right, yeah, I—yeah," Sirius mumbled, looking awkward.Remus smiled. "It's fine. I'm having enough fun watching you freak out—errr, I mean dancing, if that's what you call it."James stuck out his tongue and Remus giggled, going back to carefully wrapping Peter's last present./\/\/\/\/\Sirius and Remus watched James's practice with very little interest. They kept talking about the cake. Sirius was worried about messing the baking up and Remus tried to reassure him it'd be fine. Lily was good at baking, and he was okay. And even if the cake didn't turn out perfect he had a feeling Peter would be happy.James finished his practice and wanted to go right into baking even though he was soaked from the sleet and sweat. Remus made him get a shower first, which only took a few minutes (and he smelled like he rinsed off, not really washed). Then they were ready to go. They met up with Lily in the common room and trooped down to the kitchens where they found a table set aside for them which had loads of Muggle utensils, and all the ingredients they needed. Plus four aprons hanging up. Two white ones, one green, and one pink. They all dove for the aprons, and James wound up with the pink one. Remus and Sirius were in white, and Lily in green."Okay," she said, pulling her hair back into a high ponytail. "First off, wash the hands. Second, let's check the recipe."Lily didn't have a recipe at hand for a Victoria sponge but McGonagall had kindly gotten them a book with a recipe inside."Remy sucks at Potions, how's he supposed to bake?" Sirius asked, pulling his own hair back too.Remus elbowed him. "The smells are the worst part of making potions. These smell fine.""All right. Potter, you can butter those tins then put the baking paper in. Let's see... Black, we need two hundred grams of sugar and the same amount of softened butter."Sirius peered at the butter. "How do I soften it? Incendio?""Wha—" Lily turned as Sirius got his wand out. "No!!" She dove over, grabbing his wrist. "Bloody hell, you're not to set anything on fire!""How do I soften it?!""Boil some water, and put the dish in the water.""The butter will get wet."Lily rubbed her forehead and muttered under her breath about not murdering anyone. "I'll soften the butter," Remus said, hurrying over to fill a pan with water. He set it on the stove and then nestled a bowl down in there, needing one of the house-elves to help him get the stove on since he wasn't completely sure. It needed to be lit with magic but soon the water began bubbling. Remus put the butter in the bowl and once it softened enough he transported it to the scales to get the proper amount, and dumped it in with the sugar.Lily had Sirius beat some eggs in the meantime and he was going hog wild with the whisk, sending egg flying everywhere. There were bits of shell still in there too. Remus took the bowl from him and got a new one. Cracking eggs, however, wasn't something he could do easily. More often than not the eggs wound up on the floor. He cautiously tried one, and pieces of shell went everywhere.Sirius snorted and Remus rolled his eyes, dumping the ruined egg out. "You try again, then, this time without the shell."Sirius cracked one of the eggs, and shell flakes went everywhere. Lily swore and flounced over, taking the eggs and the bowl, easily cracking them without a fleck of shell. She shoved the bowl back to Sirius. "Beat them without sending the eggs everywhere please?"While Sirius worked, James helped Lily add the other dry stuff. The flour and the baking powder. While they worked, Remus took some other bowls and began working on the sugar biscuits. The recipe in the book wasn't quite the same as the ones Remus made with his mother, but since he couldn't remember that recipe exactly he had to use the book. At least there weren't eggs involved, so he didn't need to worry about that."How did you get so much flour on you?" Lily demanded.Remus glanced over, seeing James with flour all over his apron, arms, and face. "I dumped it in the bowl to weigh it and it poofed up on me."The bowl on the scales was overly full, flour spilling everywhere. "You don't dump ingredients in like that, you need to be careful—""I was being careful!""How is that being careful?""I... underestimated how much would come out when I poured it.""Did—did you just tip it completely over? Upside down?"James looked guilty, tugging at his collar. "Uh, no, obviously not!"Lily groaned and put the flour back into the bag. She swept the flour off the scale and table, then carefully poured the correct amount out. James rolled his eyes and shuffled over to Remus, helping him. Or trying to help him. When he dumped out the sugar the same thing happened: it all poured out and overflowed."Uh, whoops."While Sirius and Lily worked on the cake—arguing, though not as bad as Lily and James—James and Remus worked on the biscuits. This was a disaster duo as James wasn't careful and Remus was clumsy. He dropped things while James tended to knock things over in his rush to help. At least Sirius wasn't somehow amazing at cooking, and kept messing up too. Remus felt a bit guilty for saddling Lily with all of this stress; perhaps it should have just been the two of them, but he knew James and Sirius would have been hurt. Besides, the treats were better because they all worked on them, right?Finally, Lily poured the cake batter into the tins and slid them into the oven. She flopped back in a chair, blowing a loose strand of hair away from her face."This was fun!" Sirius said, egg all over him."Definitely fun," agreed flour-covered James. "What a great afternoon's work.""We're not done yet," Lily said and both boys looked at her. "We have to make the filling and put the cake together.""And make the icing for the biscuits," said Remus, collapsed in a seat next to Lily. "Peter likes his with frosting on them.""How do Muggles survive doing everything like this?!" James wailed.Lily laughed. "We do very well, thank you very much. We've survived this long. And I stand by what I've said before, in some ways Muggles are so much more advanced than magic!""Name one thing," James said.Lily smirked. "Muggles have gone to the moon? They can fly without magic. Electricity is amazing. Plus wizards don't have tellies, which is a downright shame.""What's tellies?" Sirius asked.Lily tried her best to explain, but it was pretty obvious James and Sirius weren't really getting it. Soon, the timer for the biscuits dinged and Remus took them out, setting them on a counter to cool. Sirius came over to help mix the icing up which resulted in icing going everywhere. Sirius accidentally got some on Remus's sleeve, so Remus flicked some at him, and soon icing was flying back and forth. Remus reached into the bowl for more and came out with hardly any on his hand."Blast it, now we have to make more," he grumbled.Sirius was laughing, icing all over his apron, clothes, face, and in his hair. Remus knew he looked just as bad."Are you two done making a mess?" Lily teased as she took the sponge cakes out of the oven."No," Sirius said at the same time Remus said, "Yes."Sirius reached over and smeared a dab on the end of Remus's nose. He rolled his eyes and went to wash his hands so he could make another batch of icing, while James and Lily worked on the sponge cake filling."If you throw any of this at me, I am going to throw you into the oven," Lily threatened. James swiped some up onto his finger. Lily pointed the wooden spoon at him. "I mean it!"Remus shook his head vigorously behind Lily, and James stuck his finger in his mouth as if that's what he intended to do all along.They got the house-elves to cool down the cake and biscuits so they could finish making them without having to wait. Remus let Sirius and James decorate the biscuits while he helped Lily spread the buttercream and jam. Despite being careful, Remus got jam all over his fingers and kept having to wipe them off on his apron, leaving long red streaks that reminded him of blood."Think Pete will like these?" Sirius held up two biscuits that with the icing and held together looked like boobs."You're disgusting," Lily complained.Sirius grinned and held up another that had a penis on it. He and James dissolved into giggles, and Remus tried not to giggle too. He finished with the jam and stepped back so Lily could put the top cake on, pressing gently down. They dusted the top with powdered sugar and then stepped back to admire their work. It was... a bit messy and sloppy, but looked good enough."Can I put a penis on the cake?" Sirius asked, holding up the bag of icing."No!" Lily snapped."Boobs?""NO! This is supposed to be a nice gift for Peter!"Sirius shrugged. "Peter likes boobs." At that Remus began choking trying not to laugh, while James had to grab one of the chairs to stop himself from falling over laughing.Lily gave him a look then threw her hands in the air. "Why are boys so immature?! Do what you want with the cake."Sirius skipped over and carefully began squeezing icing out. Remus thought he might be putting boobs but when Sirius stepped back, they saw he had drawn a heart.Sirius winked at Lily, and skipped back to James's side to finish decorating the biscuits.

Remus and Lily both knew what they'd have to do, however James and Sirius were a little taken aback over the fact they needed to clean up the absolute mess the four of them made baking. When Sirius asked a house-elf, she replied they had all been informed by McGonagall under no circumstances may they help clean. It took the four of them quite a while to clean everything up, and the Marauders were getting worried they missed Peter coming back.They swung by McGonagall's office on the way to the tower, and she informed them that Peter was not back yet. She gave them each a long look—the only one not covered in stuff being Lily and she had a few dabs and smears on her face and apron—before asking if they cleaned."Yes, Professor," Lily promised. She was carrying the cake and took the lid off to show her. Professor McGonagall smiled, and told them to have a good afternoon."Good," Sirius said as they resumed their journey to the Gryffindor tower, "we have time to decorate the dorm."Remus wasn't allowed to carry anything which was good since he fell flat on his face trying to get into the common room. James snickered and helped him up."Oi, Potter, nice apron!" someone shouted.James looked down at the pink frilly apron then back up. "Thanks!" he said cheerfully.At the foot of the boys' staircase Lily hesitated then turned to give James the cake. "Here...""You can come up," he said and marched up the stairs. Sirius followed, carrying the biscuits. Lily looked at Remus who shrugged, and the two of them followed. The dorm was a mess like usual, but Lily picked her way across the floor and set the cake on Peter's desk."We should probably get showers," Sirius said, picking at some dried icing that was stuck in his hair."I already got one today," James grumbled, taking the apron off and tossing it in the laundry bin. "Besides, it'd be weird with Evans here.""I'm not getting one in the boys' bathroom!" she said, recoiling slightly with a disgusted look on her face.James rolled his eyes. "I didn't mean you were, I meant you waiting in the dorm. With us... you know... across the hall."Lily folded her arms, raising an eyebrow. "Naked?" she asked.James jerked back, obviously embarrassed. "Y—yes, exactly.""It does feel weird," Sirius agreed."You boys afraid I'll come take a peek?" she taunted.Remus began burning red at the thought. "Of c-c-course not!" he stammered.Lily looked James up and down. "Don't worry, there is negative temptation for that!""What, don't want a peek at Remus?" James teased.Remus knew he couldn't go even redder. He began choking, doubling over, feeling absolutely horrified at James for saying such a thing! It was bad enough Lily made a joke about all of them in general, but—but James—making it—personal—that—it—"Jamie-boy, I think you killed Remus," Sirius said, hurrying over to smack Remus's back."I'm n—no—I—th—w—I d—w—" was all Remus managed to get out. He felt sick."I'd never," Lily promised gently. "Potter, you rat! Look what you did.""Whoa, sorry, Remy, I was trying to tease Red, not you," James said.Remus shook his head, feeling tears springing up from his throat and chest burning. "Fine," he managed to gasp out though it was further from the truth. He wanted to crawl under his bed and die. He couldn't even look at Lily. Or James. Or even Sirius. He just stared down at shoes, wishing he could disappear. It was so stupid to be this upset over such a—an innocuous teasing yet he couldn't help but feel on edge."I—I'm going to go." Lily hurried to the door, her own face rather pink. "I'll come back after we've all gotten showers, if you still want me here—""That'd be fine," Sirius said, rubbing Remus's back which was not helping. Lily shut the door and her footsteps retreated. Remus could still hear them but he figured the others couldn't because Sirius whirled on James. "Why did you say that?!""It was a joke!" James protested. "I didn't mean—I wasn't thinking. Remus, I'm sorry—""It's fine," he lied, trying to smile, trying not to shake. He couldn't believe he reacted like this. It wasn't fair! Why couldn't he take it in stride? But the thought of Lily... or anyone... peeping on him in the shower was... Merlin, he thought, clutching his stomach as he tried not to throw up. "We sh-should get showers though."He gathered some clean clothes and his soap, hurrying across the hall to jump into one of the showers. He felt awkward as he shut the curtains, practically feeling like someone was looking. He quickly shucked his filthy clothes off and jumped into the shower part, shutting that curtain which made him feel slightly better. He turned the hot water on and leaned against the wall, fingertips pressed against his scar, sliding along the ridges. Sure, the idea of someone looking in and seeing his penis was bad enough, but—well, okay, more than bad enough. It made his blood run cold and made him contemplate the pros and cons of becoming a hermit for the rest of his life. But as horrifyingly, appallingly, death-worthy embarrassing someone seeing his penis was... it'd be better than someone seeing his arm. Seeing his scar.Maybe.Right?Possibly they were on the same level. The scar wasn't embarrassing, it was dangerous. Someone seeing his genitals wasn't life-threatening, someone seeing his arm was. Still... either one was... sickeningly unpleasant. Okay. All of it was, the whole thing. The scar, the penis, everything! Even though he knew he had a lot of growing up to do, he doubted he'd ever be okay with his body. He looked too frail and delicate; he doubted he'd ever be masculine-looking. His scrawny body would only ever be a laughing stock.In any case, I don't have to worry about anyone seeing my body since I'll never have a girlfriend, he thought as he finally stepped under the hot water to clean off. At least the anxiety over hating his stupid body took over the anxiety of being spied on.Once all three Marauders were squeaky clean they began tidying up the dorm a bit, music playing; soon Lily knocked at the door and came in. She helped put up a banner Sirius drew that said Happy 13th Petey! with various drawings on it like a camera, a wonky owl that sorta looked like Cocoa, and various sweets. James blew up balloons, and Remus put the levitation spell on them to make them float. At one point Struthers came in to get something and he glanced around the room."Is he getting out of the hospital wing today?""He should be back today, yeah," Sirius said, lifting his side of the banner up a bit more and using a sticking spell."I didn't know it was his birthday...""It's not a problem for us to do this, is it?" James asked, slightly sneering.Struthers shook his head. "Of course not. I—I'll let Andy know... we'll stay out of your way tonight."After he left, Lily hopped down off of the desk she had been standing on and took a look around. "You know, you could probably make use of an empty, unused classroom for birthday celebrations," she said. "Not—not right this minute, I mean... in the future. That way you wouldn't need to worry about your dormmates.""Who was worried about Spinnet anyway?" muttered Sirius.Remus agreed—not saying so of course—about using a classroom, especially in this instance when they had no idea when Peter would be back. They could be waiting for ages! But after only another half an hour (during which time James went to get drinks and proper food from the kitchen in case Peter was hungry for sandwiches or something), Remus heard tired, slogging sort of footsteps."I think he's coming," Remus said, and the other three went quiet.Peter opened the door, his entire body drooped, a frown on his face."Surprise!" James, Sirius, Lily, and Remus all shouted and Sirius threw a handful of confetti while James blew on a noisemaker he had kept from New Years.Peter staggered back, jaw dropping open, eyes going enormous. "Wh—what?! Guys...!""Welcome back, and happy birthday!" James said, running over to give Pete a gentle hug. Sirius and Remus went to join, all three of them carefully hugging their friend. Peter gave a whimper and hugged them all back, the four of them clinging to one another. They fussed over him, pulling him into the dorm and to his bed so he could sit down."How are you feeling?""Are you doing okay?""Are you all healed up?""What was it like?""Does it hurt?""Do you need rest?""Did they let you keep it after they took it out?""Do you have a scar?""Do you need anything right now?"Peter tried to answer but all the questions came too rapidly; he shut his mouth and shook his head. "I'm okay," he finally said. "It's been... really weird. I didn't like being at Saint Mungo's but... Sirius, you were right, they gave me a draught of the living death and then I woke up and my appendix was gone. I do kinda have a—Oh! Evans!" He suddenly realized they weren't alone, and went pink."Welcome back," Lily said, coming over a bit awkwardly, "I won't stay, since you need to catch up—""It's okay," Peter said though looked confused as to why she was there. Then his eyes traveled to the banner, and he went pinker. "Ahh...""Look what we did!" James jumped up and ran over to his desk, picking up the cake. "We made you a cake! And biscuits.""A—cake?" Peter got up, going over to check it out. "A cake for me?""We made it," James said. "With our hands!"Peter looked over his shoulder at Remus who nodded, laughing. "We did," he said. "Er, well, Lily did... most of it.""Hey, we helped a lot!" James protested."Not really, we mostly just made a mess," Sirius said, and James elbowed him."They did help," Lily admitted, tucking some hair back. "It was a joint effort. I'm not going to stay, really, I mostly wanted to say I'm really glad you're feeling better, and happy birthday!" She approached Peter and gave him a quick hug before leaving the dorm.Peter stared after her. "She hugged me," he whispered.Sirius clapped him on the back. "She did! Congratulations!""It was a long hug too," James said, nudging Peter. He opened his mouth to say something, looking at Remus, then shut his mouth. Remus suspected he was going to make a joke about Pete stealing Lily from Remus, and he was very glad James decided not to go there.Peter looked down at the cake. "You guys really made this for me?""The Muggle way," James said."Wow! Thank you, that's—ahh, wow, thank you!" Peter beamed at all of them, but he was looking rather haggard so Remus sat back down on his bed and pat next to him. Peter sank down, obviously not fully recovered. "I was gonna show you, I have a scar. It's starting to fade but..." Peter lifted his shirt and showed a pink mark down the side of his midriff. "It should be gone in a day or two.""That's super impressive," James said, and Peter squeaked happily. "We were going to try to sneak into Saint Mungo's this morning to visit you for your birthday but Remus wouldn't let us."Remus snorted at that, shaking his head."Oh! It's good you didn't though, Mum and Dad were there all morning, and Professor McGonagall came to visit too," Peter said."She did? McGonsie?" Sirius asked."Uh-huh. So most likely you would have been caught.""What was it like, being in there?" Remus asked, very curious since he had never seen the place, or knew anything about it besides some information from a few books."I dunno. I was in a lot of pain and crying a lot by the time we got there. They took me to a room where Mum and Dad soon showed up. I was put in a gown and then given the draught, and fell asleep. When I woke up it was all over. Mum and Dad were still there. The scar was really awful looking but I was given some potion to put on it to help speed up the healing. It hurt a lot... well, not a lot, not like before, but it kinda ached, and then I was given a lighter sleeping potion to get through the night."Peter lifted his shirt again and began poking at the scar."It's so weird to think they took something out of my body. Muggles do that a lot, with surgery an' stuff, but it's not that common in the magic world, Mum said. Pomfrey kept apologizing though, she says it was her fault it got that bad...""You saw Pomfrey? Did she visit?" James asked."Not 'xactly, she's the one who brought me back here and did a quick checkup before letting me come back to the dorm." Peter poked at the scar one more time then lowered his shirt. "I mean, it isn't really her fault, I was so confused where the pain was. I really thought it was my stomach.""Speaking of stomachs, are you hungry?" Sirius asked, grabbing the tray of sandwiches.Peter took one. "Yeah, a bit. Lunch wasn't that great there so I didn't eat much. What have you guys been doing?""Missing you," James said."Definitely missing you," Remus agreed, and Peter smiled."You did miss getting to see Jimsy in a pink frilly apron though," Sirius said, and danced away as James tried to kick him. "He looked fantastic!" Then he yelped as James successfully hooked his foot around Sirius's ankle, and he went crashing to the floor with a lot of laughter.Peter giggled. "I'm sorry I missed it!"James sighed and went to his laundry bin, getting out the flour covered apron and putting it on. He did a little spin and a 'tada!' motion. Peter clapped happily and James took a bow before throwing the apron back in the bin.After they ate a few sandwiches, James, Sirius, and Remus lit up their wands to sing For He's A Jolly Good Fellow since none of them had candles. Peter pretended to blow them out and there was a chorus of "Nox!" and then laughter. Sirius cut the cake into several oozy slices and the four sat on Peter's bed getting bits of cake everywhere."This is the best cake I've ever had," Peter said, jam and buttercream smeared all over his fingers and face. "You're the best friends anyone could ever have."Despite all of them being sticky they all hugged again, another group hug. Remus tried not to hug too hard and it was difficult because he wanted to hold onto them and never let go; he couldn't believe it... sitting here in a big hug like this with three guys who knew his secret and were still hugging like this, and calling him a best friend! He was a monster, and yet he knew perfectly well how honest Peter was about saying that. He meant it. He meant it, saying someone like Remus was his best friend, and that James and Sirius felt the same.When they let go, Remus turned away in pretense of going for a glass of water when in reality he was trying not to let the emotions get to him.They had more cake, washed up their hands, then Remus and James took the sheets and stuff off of Peter's bed and remade with clean ones so he wouldn't have to. Then, finally it came time for presents. Remus had knitted Peter some socks which was a stupid gift so he also included two bottles of grape soda (Peter's favorite, which Remus absolutely did not steal from the Hogwarts kitchen), and a promise to write an entire essay for him. Sirius had drawn him a picture of Peter giving a peace sign and a roll of film for his camera. James, however, showered Peter with a new strap for his camera, several boxes of sweets, a bottle of butterbeer, and a tripod. A really fancy looking one."Whoa," Peter said, running his fingers along the box. He quickly took it out of the box and set it up, placing his camera on the top. He fiddled with it then grabbed the others, pulling them in for a smushed together photo, all four of them laughing. "Thanks, guys, this is all amazing!" He stuck the drawing up on the wall and then kicked his shoes and socks off so he could put Remus's socks on."Ooh, I almost forgot, check out these," Sirius said and got the platter of sugar biscuits."Oh wow!" Peter said, taking one of them. "Tit biscuits."Sirius beamed, proud of himself. "You mean... bisc-tits?"All four of the Marauders collapsed with laughter at Sirius's pun, and decided from now on they'd call them bisctits.But Peter obviously had done too much because he put a hand against his side, flinching a little. The others made him get into bed and sat down, chatting with him, batting some balloons back and forth. With the sandwiches and everything they didn't need to go to supper so they remained in their dorm for the rest of the night. James and Sirius danced a lot. Peter tried to dance too but was still recovering and Remus had to force him back into bed."You can dance in my place, then," Peter said innocently, and Remus glared."Come on, you didn't dance last night!" James said, then stopped, realizing something. "You never told us how it went. Oh Merlin, we were so wrapped up with Peter—""It's all right," Remus said quickly. Sirius had briefly asked him the night before, but Remus had been too tired to talk about it; Sirius had tried to get him to say anything and all Remus had said was it went fine, he was fine, and really tired. Now he didn't feel like talking about it at all. It felt... well, he should at least let them know about how wonderful their gifts were. "The box stayed intact, by the way. As did the blanket," he added, turning back to Pete. "There weren't any rips on it at all. They both held up completely. It... was so nice being able to have a blanket—a whole blanket—around me the night I didn't transform, and it was wonderful to read up until the moon—" He stopped, blushing slightly. "And of course I am forever grateful for the earplugs as well, James."Peter crawled over, hugging Remus tightly. "I am so glad!""Hey, that's terrific news!" Sirius said, jumping onto Pete's bed to hug Remus too, arm wrapping around his chest, yanking him back against him, half in his lap. Remus let out a slight choking noise and then tried to get free while Sirius gave him a noogie. "Were they—were the nights too rough?" Sirius asked when he finally let go. "Your injuries lasted a long time... at least they seemed to."Remus shrank back, fixing his hair. "No. It—it wasn't too bad. The wounds were deep, is all. I was well enough to be allowed to leave, after all." He didn't feel like talking about the full moon. For some reason he kinda felt nervous about it, and anxious. Plus it was Peter's big day and he didn't deserve everyone talking about a monster instead of focusing on him. "Anyway..." he finished smoothing his locks down and wriggled closer to Peter, leaning back against his headboard. "Why don't we play a board game or something, so Petey can join in?"James snapped his fingers. "Good idea!"Soon the four were playing Hogwarts House Cup. Since none of them wanted to be Slytherin, James put the pieces in a cup and shook them up, everyone reaching in to take a piece. Remus wound up with the green piece (he absolutely cheated so Pete wouldn't get it), and Peter was ecstatic to be red. They played several rounds, during which Spinnet and Struthers came up. They both told Peter they were glad he was doing better, and glad he was back. They both also wished him a happy birthday. Spinnet didn't complain about the loud music or the decorations everywhere, and Peter offered them both some cake and biscuits.They both took a biscuit, Spinnet staring at the icing penis on the top of his. "Do I even want to know?" he asked, and broke it into pieces before eating."You... wanna join us for some exploding snaps?" James asked.Spinnet stared at him. "Er. Why not?"The six of them settled on the floor, playing cards until well into the night. It was one of the nicest evenings that dorm ever saw, with all six of them getting along. Remus knew it wouldn't last. Soon, Sirius and Spinnet would be back to fighting, and Spinnet would probably be insulting James and Remus too, but at least they had one good night.They all said goodnight, doing their typical night routines to get ready for bed. The record player was turned off, but the decoration remained up since nobody felt like cleaning them. Remus crawled into bed after several goodnights and curled up with Gwyllgi in his arms./\/\/\/\/\The next morning Remus was once again not the last to get out of bed. Peter was still sound asleep, and Remus got an uneasy chill down his spine remembering a few days ago when Peter was starting to feel unwell. However, once he finally got up he promised he felt okay, he just hadn't slept much."You feeling better?" Sirius asked."Yeah, much, thanks," Peter replied. He noticed the looks on James and Remus's face so he explained, "I, um, had a pretty awful nightmare last night. Sirius helped me."Remus had woken up at some point during the night thinking he heard muffled voices, but they had been so soft he figured he was imagining them or dreaming them and went back to sleep. "I'm sorry you had one that bad," he said.Peter shrugged. "It was... you know... from Saturday. I kept dreaming about hands reaching into me and—and pulling out my insides." He looked embarrassed as he began tying his shoes. "Kinda dumb, really.""I told you last night it isn't dumb," Sirius said firmly, swiftly tying his tie perfectly without even looking at it."You went through something traumatic, it's natural to have nightmares about it," said Remus, trying to get his tie knotted even semi-decently. As usual he gave up, and instead flopped onto his bed to get socks on."There's nothing wrong with having nightmares," James agreed, glancing very briefly at Remus. "If I had my... um, apindeck taken out—""Appendix," Remus muttered."—I'd probably have nightmares too." James finished tying his shoes and jumped up to his feet. "Sirius, how do you even hear this though? I know you don't have the spell on your bed but..."Sirius stiffened very slightly, so quickly that Remus thought he could have imagined it. Then he was relaxed again, a broad smile on his face. "I'm a light sleeper," he said, though there was something in the tone of his voice that didn't sit well with Remus. He just wasn't sure what, or why it would be... not so good.Perhaps I'm imagining it, Remus thought as they left, or started to. James poked Remus's arm and informed him his jumper was inside out. Remus sighed, taking his robes off so he could get the jumper flipped, ignoring the amused looks on their faces."You really think it was traumatic enough to give me nightmares?" Peter whispered to Remus as they made their way down to the Great Hall."Of course," Remus assured him."But... I'm all healed up. My scar's almost gone, too."Remus shrugged, shifting the strap of his satchel up higher. He tried not to feel bitter over those words. "Just because you've healed physically doesn't change the fact you've gone through it." Ugh, and how true was that? It'd be nice if once the physical aspect of injuries faded the mental side did as well.Peter slowly nodded. "Okay, yeah. Thank you." He elbowed Remus who elbowed him back, saying again how happy he was Pete was back.

The next few days were a whirl of excitement for Peter being back, playing pranks, planning pranks, Occlumency which went fairly well, James and Sirius getting in big trouble for trying to attach some LiftAways to Professor Prewett, James and Sirius getting into slightly less trouble for trying to attach some LiftAways to Snape, and then Dumbledore announcing a temporary ban on LiftAways when James and Sirius were caught attaching LiftAways to Sirius along with a rope tied to his ankle outside to see how high he'd float."We were fine!" James moaned, throwing himself onto his bed Wednesday afternoon, right after it happened.Remus, who had been studying in his dorm for a big History exam coming up, glanced over. "Fine with what?" he asked. James and Sirius remained conspicuously silent, and Peter was the one to tell Remus what the three of them had been up to. Remus threw his quill down. "ARE YOU BLOODY INSANE?!" he shrieked, then held up a hand. "No, no, don't answer that, I already know you are.""Then why ask?" Sirius laughed.Remus glared then picked up an every flavor bean, lobbing it at Sirius—or trying to; it missed by several feet. Sirius laughed."It was an experiment!" James said, adjusting his glasses. "We wanted to see how high LiftAways can go!"Remus pushed his chair back, marching over to James's desk to take out the package. "It says right here, DO NOT USE OUTSIDE WITHOUT ADULT SUPERVISION!""In some countries, thirteen is considered an adult," Sirius said, stretching out on his bed, legs crossed at his ankles.Remus felt like he might explode as his blood pressure rose. "What country is that? Fantasyland? No wonder you didn't pressure me to come with you. Didn't you do enough to poor Prewett?""No poor Snape?" James teased.Remus snorted, tossing the package onto James's bed. "You best be glad you weren't seriously injured.""Sirius-ly injured," Sirius corrected him with an agonizingly annoying smirk.Remus stared at him. Sirius grinned back."I'd run," Peter said.Remus dove for his wand. Sirius shrieked, taking off out the door with Remus chasing him. "GET BACK HERE!""MAKE ME!""CIRRATIUM!""LUPIN DON'T YOU DARE!"Sirius burst into the common room and everyone who was in there turned to watch in amusement as Remus chased him out of the tower. Remus tripped a few times, and it didn't take long for Sirius to get out of sight. Once that happened Remus returned to the tower, nose stuck in the air as he tried to emulate James and Sirius's uncaring attitude while he walked through the common room. All the eyes on him made him grow anxious and on edge without Sirius there too. Soon he was up the dorm and he shut the door, dragging a chair over to push up under the handle.James and Peter were jammed together on James's bed, both of them laughing."You are absolute idiots though," Remus sniffled.He went back to studying and soon Sirius was pounding on the door, rattling the doorknob, begging them to let him in. After a minute or two he agreed that was fine, and Peter ran over to pull the chair back. Sirius came in, brushing his robes off, looking a trifle annoyed. Remus was worried he shouldn't have done that, thought perhaps it had been too far, even though the others often chased one another with threats of spells. He had done it before, but maybe he shouldn't...Remus grew more and more anxious, even when Sirius stopped acting annoyed. He considered apologizing, but if Sirius hadn't really been mad it'd be silly to apologize; still, he did on the way to History. Sirius laughed and messed up Remus's hair, telling him he needed to do stuff like that more often."It's great to see you let loose," Sirius promised.Remus smoothed his hair down, and spent the rest of the day contemplating Sirius's words./\/\/\/\/\On Thursday morning, Herbology had to be cancelled due to a terrific blizzard that dumped loads of snow on the castle. James, Sirius, and Peter weren't really sure what to do now that they had the entire morning free until Remus suggested they explore the Pits Passages some more. He had some books on art and pottery that he hoped to compare to what was in the tunnel; he had used Peter's pictures to help, but he wanted to be up and close and personal to double check everything. At least he was pretty sure he had the right century for when the tunnels were decorated, which would be a step in figuring out when they were closed. Or why they were closed."Would you lot be angry if I asked one of the ghosts for help?" Remus asked as they carefully crossed the first pit."I'd rather not have anyone know we know about this place," James said.Remus nodded, figuring as much. None of the paintings had people in them, so he couldn't exactly ask. In fact, the only living creature was the sleeping dragon. The four of them crossed a few pits then settled down in a nice-sized area. They brought a record player and some albums to listen to music while they hung out. Peter brought stuff to work on a scrapbook he had started earlier in the week, Sirius doodled in his sketchbook, Remus studied the paintings, and James—genius James—decided to practice fancy broom tricks even though there wasn't much room. Eventually he stopped trying loops and played a game of 'see how stupid I am', at least that's what Remus dubbed it. James hovered over a pit and fully stopped his broom, shrieking with adrenaline-rushed joy as he plummeted down into the pit. He'd kick the broom into gear before he hit the ground and whoosh back up into view."You're going to hurt yourself," Remus muttered as he compared a painting of a landscape to some landscapes in a book. He squinted at the signature on the painting then peered so closely to the book his nose practically touched the page."WHEEEEEEEEE!" James shouted as he plummeted back out of view."Petey, Remy," Sirius whispered, and turned his sketchbook around to show them the drawing he had made of a flattened James, looking very much like a crepe with glasses. Peter and Remus both giggled, and they quickly stopped when James popped back up. "What's so funny?" he asked."Debating what music to play at your funeral," Sirius replied, pulling his knees up to rest his sketchbook against them.James jabbed his glasses back into place. "Hardy-har-har. It's fun. You should join me.""It's going to be utterly wretched only having three Marauders," sighed Sirius rather dramatically. "Here lies James Potter—""Shut up.""—taken in the flush of his youth by his own reckless stupidity.""Says the guy who tried to see how high he could float with only a rope and two second years to keep him from drifting away," Peter pointed out, not looking up from his scrapbook.Sirius blew a raspberry. "Ah, well, I didn't say I was any less recklessly stupid. I'm just, you know, lamenting the loss of my best friend."James zipped his broom over, low enough so he could snag Sirius under an arm and drag him a little ways. Sirius kicked and yelped, or at least tried to fake yelp through his laughing. James hitched him up higher and started hovering over a pit in a teasing manner. Sirius's laughter stopped when his sketchbook slid out of his other hand and fell down into the hole."Aw, shit!" he swore."Oh man, sorry!" James returned Sirius to the ground. "I'll go get it—""I will, if you'll take me," Sirius said.The two flew down and after a moment James was back up without Sirius, looking very excited. "You guys have got to see this!"It didn't take long for James to fly them both down to the bottom of the pit. It seemed really far down compared to the one they first explored; it had to be at least two and a half, three stories down into the rock. However the real point of interest was the fact there was more blasted through the rock at the bottom. It was like a tunnel going straight ahead. Sirius stood at the mouth with his lit wand raised."Oh wow," Peter breathed out, stepping over. "What—where—"Remus lifted his wand to examine the walls. "Rough rock. This was blasted by a spell, not made properly." He ran his fingers along the rock, a shudder going down his spine."Let's explore," James said, and Sirius readily agreed.Peter, however, was unsure. "It could be dangerous, if it's not made, ummm, made properly," he said, echoing what Remus said. "It could cave in."Sirius kicked the wall and Peter yelped, scurrying back. "Seems solid to me.""You're an idiot who can't be trusted!" Peter snapped. Sirius fluttered his eyelashes back at him. "Remy, you agree with—Remus?!"Remus was moving forward, deeper into the tunnel. He hardly even heard Peter and didn't really think to answer. Someone was looking for something down here. Why? What for? Why did this pit in the mountain turn into a tunnel when the other didn't?"Remus!" He stopped as someone seized his arm, turning to look into James's eyes. "Bloody hell, so-called Brains, what were you doing?"Remus blinked a few times. "Exploring?"James raised his eyebrows. "I figured you'd be on Pete's page with this."Remus pressed his lips thin, knowing it was probably stupid to be plunging into a most likely unsafe tunnel who-knows-how-far-underground without even braces holding the place up. "I'm curious," he said."Thattaboy!" Sirius laughed, running forward to pass Remus. "Let's go!""Great, the voice of reason is being stupid too!" Peter complained. "Why do I have to be the only one to think this is a very bad plan? Remy, you're supposed to be the smart one to tell those two not to do this! Stop ignoring me! Hey—wait up!" Peter ran to catch up as the other three went farther into the dark. "I hate you all!" he grumbled as he got his wand out to light it up too.The tunnel kept getting smaller and smaller. It twisted and turned in various directions and Remus really expected it to go somewhere, but it didn't take long for them to run into a dead end. However, it didn't look like the person stopped because they felt like stopping... there was a cave-in. Not a large one, but enough to send a spike of fear through all four boys. They began backing up until Peter gave a cry, arms flailing as he tripped over something."You all right?" James asked."Yeah, I... Oh. Um, guys?"They turned to see Peter slowly standing up, holding up what he tripped over. He held his wand close and they could all see it was a book.James ran over and took the book from him. "What in Merlin's bloody name is this?" he whispered."A book," Sirius said."Terrific deduction there," James laughed. "What's it doing here? Hogwarts, A History?"Remus went over, putting his hand out for the book. He crouched down, ignoring the protests of his friends, and balanced the book on his lap. It was a much older copy than his own, and he had a somewhat old one. The author was different too. He knew whenever someone updated the book they put their own name on the front, and a list of the other authors inside. This author was the previous one from the copy Remus had. He wasn't sure how old it made the book though."Come on, Peter's right, this isn't safe," James said."Now you listen to me," Peter muttered."Just a minute," Remus said, flipping to the publication page. 1922. It was over fifty years old. He wondered if whoever left it had been in here fifty years ago, or more recently? After all, his own copy of Hogwarts, a History was from the 1950s. The most recent version had been published in the late 60s, shortly after Dumbledore became Headmaster."Remus come on!""C—coming!"Remus clutched the book to his chest, hurrying after his friends. Once back at the main pit James took them up one at a time. Remus had forgotten completely why they had even gone down until Sirius said something about being glad he got his sketchbook back. Between the time they had spent in the main passage, and the time exploring the blasted section, enough time had passed that it was almost lunchtime.He tucked the old copy of Hogwarts, a History into his satchel, planning on searching through it thoroughly to try to figure out who might have left it there. The 'why' was... well, maybe not obvious but he theorized whoever had done the blasting had left it. They blasted, the ceiling caved, and the person left in such a hurry they dropped their book without even realizing. Perhaps that wasn't what happened, but it was the only possibility he could really think of. Well... someone could have been studying down in there for some reason and forgot it. That seemed a little less likely, though, unless they hated the book./\/\/\/\/\Remus didn't get much of a chance to look at the book again for hours. He didn't dare bring it out in the Great Hall (for some reason he felt like someone might notice it wasn't his own copy and get suspicious), and after lunch they had Defense. Unfortunately, not even the curiosity of the book could tamp down the hot feelings liquefying Remus's insides as Prewett lectured with that smile on his face. Remus tried to focus on his note taking, trying his best to ignore Professor Prewett and absolutely failing. Ugh. He wished it would stop, wished he wouldn't feel this way, wished he could just... not be affected by attractive guys. Did all guys have this problem? Did other guys look at Professor Prewett and feel this way? He knew girls did but... did guys? He knew perfectly well he wasn't really normal, however... well, it wasn't something he could ever ask the other Marauders, and in any case soon he would be normal.As normal as a werewolf could get, that is.Finally the lesson ended, and Remus figured he'd go somewhere to take a good look at the book except the Marauders had different plans."We're going to hang out with the girls," Sirius said, yawning and stretching. "Cassie sent a note asking if we wanted to, I said yes."Didn't bother asking all of us, Remus thought. "Which girls?""Cassie, Colgate, and Evans," Sirius replied."I—I was going to do some... studying... besides, if you do anything you can have even teams," Remus said swiftly.Sirius elbowed him. "Nah, Cassie said she wanted to see if Magpie'd join too."Remus remained silent, rather irritated. He was going to protest but James linked an arm with his. "Come on, it'll be fun," he said. "And I really don't want to be dealing with Evans without you there.""I—""Please?"Remus looked into James's pleading eyes and sighed. "Yes, of course.""Yes!" James hugged him tightly. "You're amazing."Remus hoped he'd be able to have an out at some point but everyone wanted to play team games. He would have preferred games more like... everyone-else-do-something-while-he-hides.There was a bit of a kerfuffle when it came to choosing partners. Sirius and Inkwood partnered up easily, and Colgate shrugged, not caring about being with Peter... but for some reason Lily and Magpie both danced around wanting to be Remus's partner. Well, he knew why Lily wanted to be his partner (so she didn't have to be James's partner) but he didn't know why Magpie wanted him (unless she was harboring some silent ill will towards James?), and while he would have much preferred to be Lily's partner he didn't want to have to make a choice.James, grouchy that he was essentially last picked, suggested they flip a coin. Magpie won unfortunately, and Lily angrily partnered with James."Trust me, it's no picnic for me either, Red," James grumbled, slumping back on the couch with his arms folded."You're gonna lose guess the picture," Peter giggled. "James sucks at drawing!"Lily looked at James who forced a smile in return. "I'm not that bad. We'll do fine."They did not do fine. Sirius and Inkwood did fantastic, thanks to his artistic ability, and Peter and Colgate, and Remus and Magpie did decent, but James and Lily wound up arguing and shouting at each other when James attempted to draw a griffin and Lily kept guessing underwater creatures."HOW CAN YOU THINK IT'S A FISH?!" James yelled when their timer beeped and they lost the round."THAT LOOKS LIKE A FIN!" Lily yelled right back, pointing."IT'S A BEAK!""HOW IS THAT A BEAK?! IT'S ON ITS BACK!""THAT'S ITS HEAD!""WHY IS THE BEAK POINTING UP!""It's—it's not pointing up-up, it's angled up because the griffin is SCREECHING!""It's not OPEN!""IT IS OPEN! IT'S AN OPEN BEAK!""IT'S A BLOODY TRIANGLE HOW IS THAT OPEN?!" She grabbed the pencil and drew a quick sketch of an open beak then began jabbing the pencil at it. "OPEN! OPEN!"James snatched the pencil from her hand. "That looks like a FISH'S TAIL!""YOU LOOK LIKE A FISH'S TAIL!"Remus was very glad James didn't drag the others in, because his drawing of a griffin really did look like some sort of finned creature. Not that he and Magpie did much better, but they did get a couple points so they weren't last in that game.Charades went a lot worse for him, since first of all he was very distracted thinking of the tunnel and the book, and second of all he absolutely hated standing there in front of Colgate, Inkwood, and Magpie, and have to act out the prompts, especially with the fact they were in the common room so sometimes other students glanced over at them. His limbs felt weird and awkward, making it difficult to do much of anything, and when Magpie tried to act out her prompts Remus had no idea what she was attempting to do."Second word, first p-part..." He watched carefully as she began miming. It took quite a while before he was able to even get on the right track. "... Flowy? Oh! F-flowy? Flowy... hide? Mask? Flowy m-mask? OH! V-veil?" Remus guessed and Magpie clapped her hands. "F-first part veil. Um. Little? Small? N—no, bigger?" He squirmed, hating to be the only one talking, maybe this was worse than being the one acting out. "A little... a—a lot...? Bigger? Wider?"Then he heard Inkwood whispering very softly in Sirius's ear. "I think she's got Veilmoore."Remus perked up. "More. Veilmoore," he said immediately and Magpie nodded; Sirius immediately shot a suspicious look towards Remus who smiled innocently back before facing Magpie again to finish the charade. Except Remus had no idea what Veilmoore meant, and Magpie was motioning with her hands indicating he should say the next part. Veilmoore? What the heck was Veilmoore? Magpie stared at him then held up one finger. "First word? Sounds like?" She nodded then hesitantly began miming. "Spinning? F—flourish? Um... d-dance?" She nodded, tugging at her ear. "S—sounds like dance?" She grinned. "Uhhh... dance... p-pants... l—lance?"He saw Sirius with his head in his hands, James was obviously trying not to laugh, and Peter shaking his head. He felt worse. What was it?"Chance? France? Per...chance?" He was floundering, and unable to think of other rhymes.The timer went off and immediately Sirius blurted into his hands, "He doesn't know Quidditch!""Vance!" Magpie moaned out. "Vance Veilmoore!"Remus stared at her then at his friends."The Keeper for Wigtown Wanderers," James explained."I—I didn't—I—" He went very pink and sank down on the couch. "Sorry.""It's all right." Magpie perched next to him, giving him a smile. "It's kinda nice you're not crazy obsessed with Quidditch like most boys."Remus had no clue what to even say to that. "Er," was all he managed.It was Peter and Colgate's turn next and Remus sat back, legs crossed, foot jiggling as he tried to sneak glances at the clock. It was getting close to supper. They'd probably want to keep playing until then. He'd be unable to check the book until after supper—perhaps not until after James's practice? Except, right before 5pm Bell came over to inform James the practice was canceled due to the snowstorm."I'm not that hungry," Remus said when everyone else started getting ready to go eat. "I—I think I'll st-stay and study.""Aw, come on, come eat with us," Lily said, looking rather eager."I'm n—not really hungry," he protested, hoping his stomach wouldn't growl and give him away. "I had f-f-fun, I'll see you g-guys later." He whirled around and hurried up to the boys' dorm before anyone else could stop him. Sweet solace! he thought, collapsing onto his bed face first. It felt the entire afternoon had become chains wrapping around his body and digging in. Too much interacting with people when he really hadn't been in the mood... but at least it was over.After several minutes he rolled out of bed and flicked the radio on, turning the knobs until he had a good station playing at a tolerable sound level. Classical music drifted out and he gave a little spin, drifting back to his bed, flopping onto his stomach. He kicked his shoes off and stretched out, legs bent so his mismatched socked feet were lazily swaying through the air to the music. Part of him considered taking a nap however he fought off the sleepiness enough to dig the book out of his satchel.Hogwarts, a History, he thought, staring at the old cover. From 1922. The first thing he did was search the first few pages just in case the previous owner had written a name down. No such luck. Sighing, he began slowly flipping through the pages, not even sure what he was looking for. The biggest changes between this copy and his would be the stuff that had happened since then, and he couldn't imagine what might be in here that would give away... well, anything. Most likely it had nothing to do with the pits, except the slim chance it belonged to whoever had done it.After nearly ten minutes he found something, although not quite what he expected. Torn out pages. Two, to be precise. He ran his finger down the ragged remains, wondering what had been there. Easily enough figured out, he thought and checked the pages before and after the missing ones. Going to the list of contents he scanned down until he found what he was looking for, and he gasped out loud.The missing pages were in the section covering Salazar Slytherin's history, and the exact pages missing were about the Chamber of Secrets.Remus closed the book and hugged it to his chest, breathing rather heavily. Aegis might not have been far off the mark after all.Someone had been down in the pits possibly looking for the legendary chamber.

Friday dragged on way too long for Remus, especially since he had stayed up super late the night before. In Potions, Remus had sent a note to Aegis asking to meet him in the trophy room at 5:30, and all day long he had been distracted, waiting for their meeting. He sorta wished he had asked to meet up during lunch, except he didn't think of that until halfway through History. He couldn't wait to show Aegis the discovery, and talk to him about it.After Transfiguration, the Marauders went to their dorm to hang out. Remus sat at his desk, trying to do some homework to distract himself from Aegis and the chamber. The others put on some music however James was in the mood for something more than relaxation."I've been thinking," he said as he flopped back onto his bed, "we should start preparing for something to do for Valentine's day, it's only two and a half weeks away. I was thinking maybe trying to get our hands on some love potions.""No!" Remus snapped at the same time Sirius said, "Yes!"Remus pointed his quill at James. "No. That's really mean. How'd you like it if someone slipped you a love potion?""So? It'd be annoying but no big deal."Remus sighed. "What if someone made you fall in love with someone awful?""It's just a potion, it'll wear off and wouldn't really mean anything anyway," James shot back with a smirk."What if someone made you fall for Snivellus?"James sat upright, clutching his stomach and making retching noises. "Merlin, Remy, you can't say those sorts of things without warning!""I think I lost my appetite for the next fifty years," moaned Peter."Remus, you are truly evil," added Sirius. "Point taken. No love potion."Remus sighed with relief, turning back to his homework."What if..." Peter started, then stopped. Everyone looked at him which made him go pink. "Nuthin'.""Come on, Petey," James urged, "share your idea.""It's dumb."Sirius went over, knocking his knuckles lightly against Peter's head. "Share it anyway.""Well. I was thinking of some cartoons I've seen—""What's that?" James asked.Peter looked at Remus. "They're like... comics," Remus explained. "On the Muggle telly. They move and speak. It's like wizarding comics, but it's on the telly with sound too. It's hand drawn, not an actual live recording like some other Muggle shows." James nodded vigorously, and Remus narrowed his eyes.. "You don't understand, do you.""Not a word," James laughed, flapping his hand towards Peter. "Continue, please."Peter cleared his throat. "Anyway, when cartoon characters are in love—it, it's in comics too, really—but when it shows 'em in love, they get these big hearts floating over their head." Peter put his hands above him, cupping his hands to form a heart. "What if we can figure out a way to do that? Have hearts floating over everyone's head? Like, um, everyone, not just people in love."Now all eyes were on Remus. "Er..." He began chewing at the end of his quill. "It would be fairly easy to come up with a spell to do that, however putting the spell on everyone is another matter entirely.""It'd be like the bat-bogey thing last year," James said, snapping his fingers. "We could put it on the Great Hall doors!""That hurt Remy," Sirius said swiftly."Yeah, he kinda got unconscious after," Peter pointed out."I might be able to do better now, but I doubt I'd have the ability to sustain the spell long enough to enchant even half the students," he murmured, tapping the quill against his chin, forgetting he had it in his mouth a moment ago. He made a face and wiped his chin off on his sleeve."Maybe we could get an older student to help," Sirius suggested. "Seo-Yun might be able to!"James nodded. "We'll figure out the logics of it later—""Logistics?" Remus suggested softly."—and in the meantime Remus can knock a spell out, and we'll try to come up with a backup plan in case we can't do it, or Kim can't help us," James finished. "Excellent idea, Petey."Peter grinned. "I'm glad you liked it!"Remus looked down at his parchment, wondering how on earth he was supposed to 'knock out' a spell in two weeks?! While he considered arguing—saying he couldn't—the least he could do was try. He pushed aside his homework to write down Peter's idea in his pranks notebook. He didn't feel like going to the library to start working on it yet, so he returned to his homework while the others chattered about the prank and danced to the music./\/\/\/\/\Finally supper came and the Marauders left their dorm; Remus debated going to get a quick bite, however his stomach was too twisted up to even think about it. So he told the others he was going to go to the library early and went to the trophy room where he began pacing, twenty minutes before they were meeting. Or... hopefully meeting. Perhaps Aegis nodding at Remus after class wasn't really a confirmation. Maybe he was just nodding hello. Maybe he hadn't read the note, Remus had been distracted by James right after sending it so he hadn't seen. Aegis probably wasn't going to show up at all—"Remus?"He spun around as Aegis came in. "Hey," Remus said, smiling. "It—it's not f-five-thirty yet.""No. When I saw you were not in the Great Hall I decided to come here," he replied, walking over. "Is everything all right?""Yes! Wait till—oh, c-come on, let's go in the passage." Remus hurried over to the portrait of Scrimgeour. "Beati pacifi." Scrimgeour gave him a wink as he opened up. The two boys clambered in, heading to the first pit which they sat down next to, wands lit. Remus tucked his wand behind his ear so he could pull the old copy of Hogwarts, a History out of his bag. "All right, yesterday we were relaxing in the passage, and Sirius dropped something down one of the—the pits. He and James went down to get it, and f-found the pit had a tunnel going off of it."Aegis frowned. "A tunnel?""Uh-huh. We explored it. It—it d-didn't go far, just sort of... twisted around getting smaller. It ended in what looked like a c-cave in, but..." Remus turned the book around to face Aegis. "We found this in the tunnel.""The... tunnel? Underground?""Yep. Someone was down there in the last fifty years."Aegis took the book, running his fingers along the cover. "It is not surprising someone made the discovery though. It is interesting, but—""Nothing wild, right?" Remus asked, and Aegis gave an apologetic nod. "That's what I thought. It was kinda weird and interesting, not a huge deal. Until..." He opened the book, showing the jagged edges of where the pages had been ripped out. "This.""Someone removed pages?""Yes."Aegis gave Remus a smile. "I am assuming there is something special about these pages?" Remus pulled his own copy of the book out, and opened up to the same section without a word. Aegis's eyes slowly grew wider as he realized what Remus meant. "The Chamber of—""Secrets," Remus confirmed. "I think you might have been right. I think someone went down into those pits to look for it. Or... made them, looking for it.""That really was only a guess before we knew they were in the mountains, you know that—""But why was this book down there? With the section about the Chamber missing?"Aegis shook his head. "It is quite a mystery. Which pit?""It's..." Remus looked across the one they were next to. "It's nearly at the other end."Aegis picked up Remus's copy to look at what little was written. "I wish we could go look, however I do not have a broom..."Remus leaned back against the wall, trying to figure out a way to get down into the pits. "We could use a school broom?" he suggested.Aegis shot him an amused look. "You are suggesting we nick a school broom?"He made a face, tilting his hand back and forth in an 'eh' motion. "Borrow."Aegis stared in disbelief then tipped his head back, laughing hard. "Merlin! I don't even know what to say to that. You are... I told you before, I never expected you to be like this. Such a troublemaker!"Remus looked down, unsure how to respond. He hoped it wasn't in a bad way. What if Aegis decided he was too much of a troublemaker? Perhaps he should hide his... more mischievous side... that'd probably be the right thing to do. The best thing. "I—I—I was—was jo—jok—joking," he tried with a shaky smile.Aegis raised his eyebrows. "No, you weren't."Remus began fiddling with the end of his sleeve, feeling nauseated, feeling like he had made a huge mistake. He had been too casual. Too... himself. He shouldn't have done that. Being around the Marauders was really affecting the way he interacted with others. Despite still having uneasiness with some aspects of his personality showing (like chasing Sirius the other day), he was getting quite comfortable around them. That being said… it didn't mean he should risk being comfortable with others. He and Aegis weren't super close. He needed to do better about hiding his thoughts and personality, so Aegis wouldn't hate him. Not that he really deserved to be liked."I—"Aegis suddenly reached out, then stopped, hand hovering a few inches from Remus's arm. "It's okay. I am amused. Not annoyed, if that is what has upset you." His voice was kinda tense, and Remus could tell his muscles were tight."I—I'm—I'm—I'm n-not upset," Remus lied."I am... I'm sorry. I was meaning it in a good way, I promise, I didn't mean to say troublemaker in a bad manner.""No, r-really it's—""Please, I am very sorry—"They broke off, looking at each other, knowing perfectly well this cycle would continue until one of them broke down."Your... ah, shall I say, Marauder nature is very admirable," Aegis said firmly. "It simply goes entirely against what you seem.""I... I t-try not to be—I do try to be—""Quiet and unassuming?" Remus nodded. "Understandable." Now he began messing with the end of his sleeve. "I am in a similar boat as you, when it comes to... that sort of thing." Then his cheeks went pink, and he forced a smile on his face. "I'm rambling now.""No, you're—you're fine."The air definitely felt very awkward now; it took a few minutes and the beginning of a conversation about the Chamber of Secrets before both boys started feeling a little better. Neither knew much about the chamber at all, mostly what was written in Hogwarts, a History, which wasn't much at all. Remus had found a few other books over the past few weeks however, they all pretty much went over the same few scraps of information."I could try to ask some of the other Slytherins," Aegis said as they finally got to their feet, dusting their robes off."Only if you f-feel comforta—table," replied Remus, not wanting Aegis to get anyone mad, not with the way he was (seemingly?) bullied.Aegis easily guessed what Remus really meant, and said, "Not all of them hate me. It's..." He trailed off with a sigh, exiting out of the secret passage first. He turned, watching Remus emerge. "I can ask around.""If you're sure.""I am," he promised, smiling broadly. It looked like a genuine smile. "Now then, are we nicking a broom or...?"Oh right, I casually mentioned stealing earlier, he realized, rubbing his jawline. A moment when his Marauderness had taken over. "Ah, well... I'm not—that isn't—"They left the trophy room but before Remus could make a decision one way or another (he knew what he wanted, which was to borrow a broom, even though he knew they shouldn't) they turned a corner and literally ran into someone."Watch where you're going freaks!"It was Snape, glowering fiercely at both boys."I am sorry," Aegis said pleasantly.Snape narrowed his eyes. "You know, Silverlocke, you aren't helping your reputation by hanging out with someone like that." Snape nodded towards Remus."Considering how you have been treating me since day one, I am rather surprised to find you concerned over my 'reputation'," Aegis replied. Snape flushed slightly while Remus didn't bother hiding his snicker.Snape held his chin up. "I thought I should offer some advice, seeing as how you haven't any friends in Slytherin. With the company you keep... I doubt it will happen anytime soon.""Person-n-nally I ch-choose my f-friends by if I—I-I like them or—or not," Remus said, folding his arms. "If you're only p-p-picking f-friends b-based on how they'll mm-m-make you look, that's—that's selfish and—and—and rather mercenary."Snape pretended to look at a nonexistent watch halfway through Remus's words. When he finished, Snape lowered his arm. "Took you long enough, Loopy. And... what? It was by pure chance that you happened to like Potter and Black? Let's see..." Snape folded his hands together, pressing them against his lips. "Extremely rich pureblood from an ancient line annnnnnd oh look! Another rich pureblood from an ancient line! Not to mention the fact they are both, for some unfathomable reason, well-liked.""Sh—shut up!""Really, Loopy? The richest pureblood heir in the entire country? That was mere coincidence, was it?"Remus curled his hands into fists, feeling anger rising quickly up. "Stop—sh-shut—up—that's—I didn't—"Snape took a long stride closer to Remus who backed up until he was against the wall, Snape in his face. "You think they actually like you? You?" He looked down at Remus's worn, tattered robes and uniform, then quickly back up into his eyes. "Loony Lupin? How often do you do their homework?'"That's enough, Snape—" Aegis tried.Snape ignored him. "How many of their good grades are really from you?" He leaned in close, nose practically touching Remus's face, black eyes glittering; the wolf inside Remus began stirring, stretching out, growing absolutely vengeful. It was urging Remus to attack. Not with his wand, but physically; to jump on Snape and rip his jugular out. He could practically taste the blood in his mouth. "Potter and Black are too arrogant to care about anyone but themselves, let alone a pathetic thing like you. Once they're done with you, you'll be kicked to the side—""Just b-b-because people aren't w-willing to p-put—put up with you d-d-doesn't mean it's l-like that for—for everyone!" Remus spat out.Snape stared at Remus in furious shock and the next thing Remus knew, Snape's wand was out. He grabbed Remus by the front of his robes, yanking him to the side, moving him away from the wall. Remus grabbed his wand, trying to put up a shield. He didn't manage in time. The flipendo curse slammed into him and he went flying back several feet into the far wall. His head snapped back, hitting the wall hard enough to cause a burst of light in his vision. He slumped to the ground, hands clutching his head as he moaned in pain. He heard Aegis's cry of protest, and Snape's soft laughter. By the time he could see properly Aegis was crouched in front of him trying to help him up, and Snape was long gone."'m ok," Remus panted out."No you're not!" Aegis said, taking Remus's wrist, forcing his hand down so he could see the blood smeared across his fingers.Remus's head itched slightly, and he knew he was already healed. "I—I have healing salve in my dorm." He really didn't want to go to Pomfrey, not when he had been there not too long ago for a head wound. "Besides, it—I d-don't want... her to know someone hexed me.""You are not going to snitch?" Aegis asked as they walked down the corridor.Remus recalled the vaguely recent interaction with Macdonald. "Would you?" Aegis chewed at his nails, not saying anything; Remus pulled his hood up to hide the blood. "I'll be fine," he promised and Aegis frowned. "I will. I swear.""I... all right..." They stopped at the main staircase, watching as one of the flights of stairs drifted lazily into a new position. "I'm sorry.""F-for what?"Aegis wrapped his arms around himself, gaze sliding away from Remus's. "Not helping you. For doing nothing but standing there, like a useless idiot. I am quite a coward.""You aren't a coward just because you don't want to fight," Remus said."You've stood up for me before, I should do the same!"Remus shook his head, then pretended to wind as he remembered it would probably still hurt. "Look, my—my temper gets the better of me. It's probably good you're able to quell yours so well.""Also known as being a coward, or a doormat.""You did try to get him to back off," Remus pointed out.Aegis shrugged. "Perhaps." He was obviously still miserable and Remus had no idea what to say to cheer him up. He wanted to say something like, everyone was different, or something about the houses having different traits, however considering how little pride Aegis took in being a Slytherin, Remus doubted that'd be a good idea. "Are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital wing?""Positive.""All right, then. I shall see you—ahh. We missed Study Group."Remus looked at the watch on Aegis's wrist. It was nearly seven! "Oops.""I'll see you later, Remus.""See you, Aegis. And really, it—it's fine, you were fine back there."Remus hopped onto one of the stairs going up right as it started turning. He clutched at the railing, feeling dizzy as it moved through the air. Most students continued walking up or down as it moved, which Remus hated doing; it made him too ill. Finally, the stairs locked into place and Remus hurried up, winding his way up through the castle until he got to the Gryffindor tower. None of his friends were around which, considering the blood on him, was probably a good thing.One hot shower later Remus was lying under his bed, arms wrapped around his pillow as he went over Snape's words. They had dug down into him in a way he hoped Aegis hadn't noticed. Words that echoed deep inside of him, and hearing Snape say them had dragged them to the surface.Even knowing the blood pact they had made on Halloween night, even knowing their reactions to him being a werewolf, even knowing all the proclamations of friendship and camaraderie... he was still scared they'd abandon him. Because he was so strange and unusual. Because he had such a hard time being a human. Because all he did was cause messes and force his friends to deal with his burdens—to put them through things they didn't deserve to go through, to shove the weight of responsibility down on them; they deserved to be free instead of shackled to a filthy monster. He was scared sooner or later they'd realize this, soon they'd grow tired of his abnormality, tired of having to constantly live with his problems. They knew he was a werewolf and insisted they still cared, yet he couldn't help feel that if he did something wrong it'd all be over. Like, they only needed one more excuse. That couldn't be normal—the constant fear—could it?They were wrong, these thoughts. They had to be wrong. Probably were wrong. He trusted the other Marauders. Just because James was rich didn't mean anything. It was a coincidence.Unless, they're using you, a small voice whispered.They're not, he thought back, then remembered Sirius pushing for them to give James the 'sorry we were idiots' presents then promptly coping the essay Remus had written.He tried to get up, forgetting where he was and banging his head in almost the same spot that had gotten injured earlier. Cursing, he wriggled out from under his bed in order to throw himself into some schoolwork. Trying to get the thoughts out of his head, trying not to dwell too much on what... probably... wasn't true.But he couldn't stop thinking of all of them looking at him earlier to figure out the technical side of the prank, to come up with a spell that would work. They had automatically looked at him to fill in the gaps, like they always did. Did they... were they...?No, he thought, gritting his teeth. It's Snape's nasty mouth spewing filth, and your fears lying to you.He knew that was true... but part of him was still scared./\/\/\/\/\The Marauders stayed up super late that night, taking over a corner of the common room; since it was Friday, a lot of students were staying up. To Remus's annoyance, the girls joined them. Sirius had nicked some butterbeer from an older student's dorm and James had fetched loads of snacks. They were playing James's record player, having a good time. Remus sat in an armchair, gripping his cup of butterbeer, considering going back to the dorm because he really didn't want to deal with expending energy trying to be normal. After what happened with Aegis earlier in the day he was even more hyper aware than usual about how he came across, and having Colgate, Inkwood, and Magpie around made it even more difficult. He was emotionally drained, and irritated from the encounter with Snape earlier... as well as still trying to get rid of those awful thoughts...Not to mention a raging on-and-off headache. He did excuse himself, claiming to need the loo, and ran upstairs to put in the earplugs. He stood in front of the mirror for a moment, fluffing out and adjusting his hair until all visible signs of the earplugs were hidden before he returned downstairs. The earplugs helped a little, at least. When he reappeared, Lily motioned for him to join the dancing which he shook his head at, retreating to his armchair. She shrugged, going back to dancing with Peter, both of them laughing.Magpie wasn't dancing either, she sat in the chair next to Remus, trying to make conversation. He did his best to converse back but because of a culmination of... of everything, his stutter got more and more pronounced every time he tried to talk, until he could see the slight frustration in her face as he struggled to finish a sentence. Then she tried to finish some of his sentences for him, which was even worse."I f-f-found—found th-that—that—the—the use of—of—the use of—t-t-tr-t—tran—tr—""Transfiguration spells?" Magpie offered.Remus swallowed, gripping the cup tighter. "Y-y-y—y-yes. In his w-w-works have—have al—always been—been s—been sy—sy—s—""Symbolic? I agree, Wickburn is absolutely incredible the way he does that!" Magpie said brightly. "When Olrek used the spell to transfigure the dove... I about died."Remus had too, when he first read The Fallen Dragon, but when he tried to say that the words stuck in his throat while his tongue felt like it swelled, making it impossible to talk. Magpie glanced at him, and he gave a half-smile, quickly taking a sip of butterbeer, nodding a bit, hoping that would suffice. He looked away from her, at Lily and Peter, James and Colgate, and Sirius and Inkwood... who were dancing very close together, probably closer than a teacher would like.Closer than Remus liked.Ugh, he thought miserably, trying to banish those thoughts, trying not to feel... whatever this was, trying not to care that they were dancing so close. It didn't matter that they were, because boys and girls could do that, it was okay; besides, someday soon he'd want to do that, dance close with some girl.He quickly took another sip and pushed himself farther back into the chair, wondering if it would be too rude to run off. He could claim he had an awful headache. The girls would at least believe that, then later he could tell the guys he was getting uncomfortable. That's when he realized Magpie was trying to talk to him again, asking about Wickburn's latest book which he hadn't read because new books were too expensive (and the library hadn't gotten it in)."I—I'm sorry, I d-d-don't—I—I d-don't f-f-feel—feel—don't feel—feel w—don't—""Feel well?" Magpie asked.Remus clenched his teeth, trying not to get irritated at her still trying to finish his sentences. "Y-y-yes." He got up, telling the others he had a headache and needed to go lay down. Lily offered some headache potion she had to which he lied, saying he had some of his own. The other Marauders were giving him suspicious looks. He just smiled and hurried off, rushing away from the hot common room and loud(ish) music.The dorm room was warm from the heater, though not as bad as the common room. Remus quickly changed into pajamas and threw himself into bed. The day had started very promising with the thought of figuring out the passage stuff with Aegis but otherwise most of the day had been kicking Remus over and over.Hopefully tomorrow goes better, he thought, burying his head under his pillow.

Author's note: My writing has kinda slowed down recently so I am gonna have to cut back to just Tues and Fri for now I'm sorry. Hopefully I can get back to a really good backlog of chapters soon! Also, brief gore mentioned in this chapter, during and after Remus's nightmare. In addition, if anyone needs the link to the discord it is in my profile! :)/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus had low grade nightmares all night, none bad enough to get him screaming or making too much noise. At one point, he did hear Sirius whisper his name, obviously sleepy and unsure, and Remus lay in silence until he heard Sirius mutter something about hearing things and going back to sleep.When early morning hit, Remus hadn't gotten much sleep but he didn't feel like trying anymore. So, he got dressed and went down for a quick breakfast before going to the library. Farrow eyed him when he came in, and Remus gave him a small smile. Farrow scowled and went back to what he was doing.Remus spread his stuff out on one of the tables, getting a quill ready to work. Instead of working on homework, he was trying to figure out a spell for the prank. He went through a multitude of books trying to find anything similar, scribbling down notes. He found a few similar ones however, none that would really work. Finally, he pushed the books aside and began writing down possible word combinations. He wrote some Latin-based words since those usually worked great for spells, but also put down some French and Welsh. Welsh seemed to work especially well for Remus, it was the language he used for the couple of original spells he had come up with already. The biggest problem, of course, was finding the right combination and twists."Whatcha working on?"Remus jumped a little, having been so far off in his thoughts he hadn't heard Lily approach. "Coming up with a spell," he answered honestly.Lily slid into the seat across from him, looking rather impressed. "Your own spell?""I—er, yeah, I've done it before," he mumbled."I didn't know that." She ran her finger along the tabletop, eyes on the parchment in front of him. "Sev told me it was next to impossible to make original spells."Remus tried not to snort, a few choice words rising to his tongue which he quickly forced back down; hearing Snape's name was not on his list of things he wanted for the day. "It is very difficult, but not impossible. Or near impossible."Lily picked up his parchment. "What the bloody hell is... byerlymasit?""Byrlymasit," Remus said and Lily crinkled her nose. "It means... bubble.""Isn't there loads of bubble spells? What is... gallon?"Remus took the parchment back, smiling a little. "Galon. I shan't tell you, otherwise it would give away too much."Lily stuck her tongue out. "I could go look it up myself, you know."He sighed. "It means heart.""Bubble heart?""S... something like that," he mumbled, straightening out his pile of notes, smudging ink everywhere.Lily folded her arms on the table, leaning forward. "Does this have anything to do with the fact Valentine's day is in two weeks?" she asked with a smirk."What?" He forced a laugh out, hand fluttering to his chest, tugging at the collar of his jumper. "Of course not! Why—why would you even think that?""Hearts?" she giggled, then shook her head. "Okay, Marauder, I shan't push you about your secrets." She studied the parchment again. "What's arnawoof? And... dell-wed?"Her complete and utter destruction of the word practically hurt, and he knew he actually flinched though he tried not to. "Arnawf, and delwedd.""That sounds nothing like what is written," she accused.Remus grinned. "Ac a yw'r Saesneg bob amser yn swnio sut olwg sydd arni?"Lily gaped at him, eyes wide, jaw dropped. "What?! Wait, can—can you really speak Welsh?"Now it was his turn to stare at her in disbelief. "Lily, I—I am Welsh.""You are?""Yes!""Oh." She began to grow brilliantly pink. "I just thought you lived there. You know, like being here doesn't make us Scottish."He didn't want to hurt her feelings although a few snickers did escape while trying not to laugh. "I'm three-quarters Welsh, one-quarter French."She slapped her hand down on the table, giving him a look. "You're part French?!""My paternal grandmother, yes," he replied. "However, I really don't have much... connection to my French heritage outside being able to speak and read it, or even much knowledge about it." He wondered, if he had never been bitten, if he would have more of a connection. If his grandmother would have taken him to France, and taught him about his ancestry. "I consider myself Welsh, through and through."Lily put her head in her hands. "Wow, Remy, I—I never knew that. I feel dumb now.""No! Don't feel dumb, I've never... really talked about it..."He wondered how much the Marauders know about his history. He rarely talked about himself... or, tried not to; it felt kinda weird to be saying all this to Lily. He could practically hear his parents urging him to keep everything to himself, and he sorta regretted admitting as much as he did.She peeped up through her fingers, eye shining with curiosity. "Could you say something in French?"Remus bit his bottom lip. "Quelque chose."Lily dropped her hands, narrowing her eyes. "I don't speak French but I think I know what you said and if you did, I hate you."Remus covered his mouth now to suppress the laughter. "Sorry! Je pense que t'es une amie merveilleuse.""That is amazing," she said. "French is such a beautiful language."He shrugged one shoulder. "Y mae, ond mae'n well gen i Gymraeg."She slowly shook her head. "That is... wow. You know Latin pretty well too, don't you?"Remus nodded, dipping the quill back into his ink. "Not... in the same manner as Welsh or French. I can read it, and write of course.""That is incredible. You're so talented."He blushed and ducked his head, writing down random words because he couldn't really concentrate. He didn't want to admit that he hadn't had any friends or people in his life growing up, so he had a lot of time to learn."It's a good thing you're awful at Potions," she said and he glanced up at her through his fringe. "You have to be bad at something to balance all the rest out!""I'm not too good at talking to people either," he mumbled, not sure if that counted. He was also a werewolf, which was definitely bad enough to cancel out pretty much everything.She shrugged and picked up one of the books he had been looking through. "Can I ask you something?""Of course."She focused hard on the book, obviously avoiding his gaze. "About what we, er, discussed last week."He felt the heat rushing to his face, knowing perfectly well what she meant without any further indication. "Th—that."She began to go pink again. "I only wanted to say, if you don't want to—""No. I mean, I—I still do." He drew a squiggly line across the page followed by a few swoops. "Perhaps if we—we settle on a time I can... I'd do better. Instead of suddenly it—it happening.""All right," she agreed. "Tomorrow?"He dropped his quill. "Ah—errr—that's—oh, to—tomorrow?"She gave him an apologetic smile. "Okay, not tomorrow. How about Tuesday?""Your birthday?" he asked, and she nodded. "Ah. Um." That was only a couple days away but it was better than tomorrow. "Y—yes, that'll be—be fine.""Are you sure?""Uh-huh, yeah.""If you change your mind—""It's fine," he promised, feeling sweat trickling along his palms and under his arms. His feet began twitching as he fought off the urge to run again. "Tuesday. Um. In the day or...? I have the—the checkup after supper, but after that is—if that's good for you?" It felt weird discussing a plan to kiss like this. Like they were planning to get together to revise some lessons or something. Taking away the embarrassment in his voice, it all seemed so... matter as fact. She didn't seem too bothered, so he tried not to be."Day is fine, unless you'd prefer evening," she replied.Remus gulped, imagining going to Occlumency with that memory on his brain. Would it be better or worse than going into Occlumency with the anticipation of it being about to happen? "Whichever is bet—better for you," he said."All right. Afternoon, then." She had a shy smile on her face, and began toying with some of her hair. "I know it's nothing... but it's still a bit awkward to think about, isn't it?""Very," he sighed out, relieved she felt a little similarly to him.She jumped to her feet. "Okay! I'll see you later!" And she suddenly rushed away.He watched her go, and then turned back to his own work, definitely unable to focus now. He tapped his quill for a minute or two then put everything away, wanting to find the Marauders to hopefully do something to provide an ample distraction. Besides, he needed to try some of the spells on a willing test subject./\/\/\/\/\Three pieces of paper stuck out from Remus's fist. James, Sirius, and Peter all stared at them until Sirius reached out, plucking one with confidence. James snatched one and Peter yelped, quickly taking the last one with a whimper. James did a countdown and they each opened their hand. The end of James's was marked with a black dot. He swore, and threw the scrap to the side with a disgusted sound."Right," he said, shoving his glasses back up. "Let's get this over with. If I end up in the hospital wing...""It's for the Valentine prank," Sirius reminded him, happily sitting back with a big grin on his face. "It's worth it!""Yeah, yeah."Remus cleared his throat, and began testing out the various spells he had cobbled together. He had no idea if any of them would even work, and ten minutes later when he finished through the list the answer was a big fat zero. He sighed, crossing off each idea."So, we can't do it?" Peter asked."I'll keep trying," Remus said, sitting cross-legged on the floor to jam together various sections of words. He focused only on Welsh now, figuring that would work the best for him. The others played cards while Remus worked. He mumbled a few of the spells, doing random flourishes with his wand. Wand movement was important too. It could be any combination, and take ages before it worked... but it was a simple spell. Or... perhaps he was going about it the wrong way? He had been focusing on making it an illusionary spell."WAIT!" he shouted, and Peter dropped his cards. "S—sorry, had a thought."He got on his knees, bending over the parchment, hands on the floor on either side as he stared at the words. What if it wasn't an illusion? What if it was conjuration? He quickly conjured some bubbles and they floated around, some of them popping, some of them staying. He licked his lips, sitting back on his heels. Okay. What if he made them heart shaped?He began fiddling with the spell, tweaking the words, adjusting things. Using the wand movement for conjuring bubbles. Latin and Welsh jammed together until he managed to form a heart-shaped bubble. The other Marauders cheered as the bubble floated for ten or fifteen seconds before popping."It's a step in the right direction!" Remus said cheerfully, wiping the sweat from his brow. He considered pulling his jumper off but the shirt he wore underneath was short-sleeved and the others would be able to see part of his scar. That wasn't going to happen. He wiped more sweat off, and began poking at the spell to make it more sustainable. He had a lot of work to do. He needed it to stay without popping—or being popped—for a long time. The longer the better. Then it needed to be attached to people. And hopefully be pink, or pink-tinted."Ugh!" he moaned after half an hour, falling onto his back and clutching his aching head. He was soaked in sweat and his head pounded so hard. "This is infuriating!""Hey, you should take a break," Sirius said."I'm fine," he said, draping an arm across his eyes. "I'll rest a moment." He counted to ten slowly in his head before sitting back up, returning to the work."We have two weeks," Peter said with a frown.Remus chewed at his fingernails. It was easier to do this than it was to allow Snape's words from the day before to get him, or to think about the fact in a couple days he would be kissing Lily on the lips. "Yes, and we need to practice it in order to get it connected to the—the activation spell. Sirius, have you talked to Kim yet?""Not yet, I figured I'd do that tomorrow after practice," he answered.Another half an hour of work and Remus managed to get a pinkish bubble that stayed floating around until he poked at it. Still poppable. That wouldn't do. Groaning in annoyance, he went back to work, head throbbing by this point. He stared at the blurry words, attempted another spell, and then his vision went extremely wonky. He swayed, and everything went black./\/\/\/\/\When Remus came to, he was shocked to find he was in his bed and not the empty classroom they had been using. He sat up, hand flying to his forehead as he glanced around at the closed curtains. There was a large piece of parchment stuck to one of the curtains and he reached out, yanking it down. He immediately scowled.Remy, stay in bed you big oaf. you over worked yourself and NEED. TO. REST. or else. you passed out. I got you back to the dorms without anyone seeing (used secret corridors to get you to the 7th floor then j got his cloak to get you through the common room. that was fun haha) anyway, please rest ok? - SB. PS: Stop scowling.He crumpled the note up and got out of bed, finding the dorm empty. There was another note stuck to the door.I SWEAR TO MERLIN REMY GET BACK IN BED RIGHT NOW OR ELSE!He rolled his eyes and threw that note away too, starting to leave the dorm until he noticed he didn't have shoes on. He returned to his bed, sticking his feet into some trainers. Then he left, hurrying down the stairs—or hurrying as much as he could, one hand on a railing to keep himself balanced."REMUS—LUPIN!"He froze at the foot of the stairs, looking guiltily up at the other Marauders. "Er—"Sirius scrambled to his feet, running over. "Go. Go!" He grabbed Remus and turned him around, pushing him back up the stairs."What? No, I'm fine—"The other Marauders followed, and James gave a tsking sound. "I don't get a flying jarvey if you are or not. You know, we almost took you to the hospital wing.""I don't need—""I know, that's why we decided to bring you here," Sirius said. They arrived at their dorm door and Sirius pushed him through.He stumbled a bit, trying to hide how aggravated he felt. "How long was I asleep?""You mean, how long has it been since you overworked yourself and fell unconscious?" Sirius asked flatly. Remus glared at him. "Forty minutes."Remus pushed his hair back, scanning the room and seeing his bag on his desk. He went over, rummaging through his satchel. Peter let out an annoyed groan. "You need to rest!""I'm healed up now, I'm all right," he promised, pulling out his notes. "I'm fine!" he said again, looking up at Sirius who was far too tall, standing over Remus with folded arms. "I'll work in bed. Will that be acceptable?""No! And if you don't follow orders, if it happens again we will take you to Pomfrey. Got it?"Remus looked up into his silver eyes which were flashing with anger. He meant it. "Okay," he replied meekly."Okay," Sirius said, relaxing. He tousled Remus's hair. "Stop pushing yourself so much.""Yeah, I—I'll take a nap or something.""Good."Remus took his shoes off and climbed into bed, curling up until the Marauders left. Remus listened, hearing them waiting outside the door. Less than a minute later the door opened and Sirius peered in. Satisfied Remus was actually resting, they finally left, footsteps retreating. Once he couldn't hear any of them anymore, Remus got his homework and shut his curtains, ignoring the stabbing pain behind his eyes as he rewrote an essay due Monday./\/\/\/\/\The rest of Saturday was spent doing anything and everything to stop himself from being alone with his thoughts. Anytime he slowed down he'd think about Tuesday and start panicking. It probably wasn't normal to be this panicky over a kiss. Sirius probably hadn't been panicky when he kissed Inkwood. Had they planned it? Had Sirius thought of it before? Or was it a spur of the moment, Happy New Year thing?That night brought another nightmare. It was late, since the Marauders had stayed up and Remus hadn't gotten to sleep until well after three. Shortly after he drifted off he dreamed of sitting with Lily somewhere—They were outside, in a pavilion sort of thing and it was spring; she was in a white dress with white flowers in her hair and looking beautiful. They held hands and then she turned to him. I'm glad we're doing this, she said. Me too, he replied. Then they bent in and kissed on the lips. Almost immediately fur began spreading across Remus, starting from his mouth. They yanked apart and Lily stared in horror as his body began twisting, morphing into the wolf in full daylight. She screamed, but the pavilion was suddenly closed with no exit. She pounded on the walls as Remus finished changing. It didn't take as long as it normally did... actually, it hardly even took a minute at all. Lily whirled around. No, Remus, please! she begged, sobbing. Remus crept forward, snarling, drool dripping onto the floor. Lily curled up, sobbing. NO! PLEASE! Remus let out a snarl and pounced, teeth digging into her ribs. Blood spread across her white dress and began splattering on the wall as he started shaking her violently. He let go, and her body flew across the room. They weren't in a pavilion at all, they were in the Hogsmeade house. She lay still as Remus ran over, bending in to her face like he was going to kiss her. Instead he opened his jaws, and bit down on her face—"NO!"Remus jerked awake with a scream."NO! I DON'T—I DIDN'T—PLEASE—"His hands were on his face, clawing at his mouth desperately to get Lily's face out. Her blood still flooded his mouth, her skin caught between his teeth. He could hear her sobbing. Could see the light leaving her eyes. Could feel her skull buckling under the strength of his jaws—He jumped out of bed, banging into Sirius who made a confused, concerned noise. Remus barely heard it as he bolted from the dorm to go across the hall into the bathroom where he threw up. He expected there to be blood, and was a little confused when he knelt panting over the commode to see only bile. He gave a few gasps and then sank back, shaky hand covering his mouth.Sirius was in the bathroom, bringing a cold, damp cloth with him into the stall. He silently handed it over. Remus took it, unfolding it to press against his face. He didn't want to deal with Sirius, couldn't do it anymore. He wanted to be alone. He wanted to tell Sirius again to just put the dumb spells on his curtains, to stop. However he knew if he tried, Sirius would protest and promise it was fine, that he didn't mind. Remus wouldn't be able to convince him. The other boy was too stubborn.He looked at the washcloth, folding and unfolding it. It was white. Like Lily's dress. He trailed a finger across the fabric, imagining a streak of red. I'm not some kind of horrific reverse-fairy-tale prince. She's not going to kiss me and turn me into a wolf. It doesn't work that way. He began wringing the cloth, water dripping out onto his pajama leg. The grey flannel darkened a bit, and he could feel the coolness on his leg underneath."You want to talk about it?" Sirius finally asked, breaking the silence. Remus shook his head, closing his eyes even though that brought back the image of Lily's rag doll body flying through the air. "You... want me to talk? Or sit in silence?""Talk," he whispered, squeezing the cloth again."All right." Sirius raked his fingers through his hair, letting out a quick breath of air as he thought. "I can't believe January is almost over. I'm really excited for Valentine's. If we can pull this off it's going to be hilarious. I can see the hearts everywhere. Course, I don't want you pushing yourself so much, if you can't get it done that's fine. We can figure something else out. Maybe we can find a potion that'll turn everyone's hair pink and sneak it into breakfast.""I wonder if they're doing a Valentine's dessert again," Remus murmured.Sirius snickered. "That was brilliant." He put his hands to his head and raised them up, miming the tall, sticky-up hair. Remus managed a smile. "If they do, we could do the pink hair thing then.""If they do, are you going?" Remus asked before he could stop himself."Eh?""With—with Inkwood.""Oh." Sirius was suddenly interested in picking lint off his pajama trousers. "Dunno, hadn't thought of that. Maybe. Even if we do, and you guys wanna prank the dessert, that'd be fine." Remus looked down, avoiding Sirius's grin. "You could go to it too, you know. With Evans."Remus wanted to say, yet again, they weren't like that but hearing her name brought the entire nightmare back when it had started fading. He twisted away, resting his head against the wall, wondering how clean the bathroom really was. Sitting on the floor like this was probably not the best idea, even though he was sure the house-elves kept things super clean. Perhaps he should at least change pajamas."Can I ask you something?" Remus asked, staring at the wall. He sensed Sirius nodding so he went on with, "Why do you—and the others—keep thinking Lily and I are... are... like that.""You're so close..."Remus wanted to reply that so were they, but it was a thought that sent a deep ache through his body along with a shiver of longing. He clamped his mouth shut, clenching his teeth as he tried to get rid of those thoughts. He shifted his weight, moving his legs farther from Sirius's legs."Boys and girls can be friends," Remus finally said, twisting the hem of his pajama top. "I feel like I need to make that a sign and enchant it to follow me everywhere.""Or tattoo it across your forehead," Sirius teased."Then I'd have to get rid of my fringe and I like it too much.""I don't," Sirius said and Remus started. "Er—I mean, they're not bad or anything just... you always use them to cover your eyes."He reached up, messing with his fringe. "So?""You have interesting eyes. You shouldn't hide them." Remus didn't say anything as a response however he ducked his head in a manner so his fringe flopped across his eyes. Sirius snorted, and nudged his leg with his foot. "Twat. Why do you hide your eyes so much?"Remus bit his lip, twisting his fingers into the hem even more. Because the eyes are the windows to the soul, and I've got the soul of a wolf? Because most people don't have this eye color and it is unusual and I can't be even more unusual than I already am? Because I don't want people to see my emotions? Because it's easier to hide than to face anything?Instead he gave a half-smile. "So I don't have to look at you.""Double twat.""You asked," he replied. Sirius snorted. He started to say something, but Remus quickly interrupted, not really wanting this conversation to continue. He also didn't want to think about what interesting eyes might mean, or how they went from Sirius taking Inkwood on a Valentine's date to the subject of his eyes. "I'm—I'm feeling better.""Oh...!"Rems got up, brushing his hands off. "Thank you."Sirius got up too, smiling. "Anytime. I mean it."Remus rolled his eyes. "I'm very aware you do mean it, despite me telling you that you don't need to do this."Sirius poked Remus's shoulder and waited while Remus washed his face off, and rinsed his mouth out. They returned to the dorm and whispered goodnights, although Remus didn't go directly to bed; instead he changed into clean pajamas before finally getting back under the covers. He tossed and turned a bit until finally drifting back to sleep, clutching Gwyllgi.

Author's note: First of all I completely forgot to shout out my friend in the last chapter! Thank you Angel for helping me with the French! Angel posts on AO3 with the handle NoStringsOnMe. Also a reminder that I do use google translate for the Welsh so I really apologize for that. Second of all, internalized homophobia in this chapter./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus was glad he didn't need to worry about seeing Lily first thing in the morning. He thought if he did he'd freak out. Instead, the Marauders snatched some toast and bacon, hurrying out to the pitch for the Gryffindor practice. Sirius, Peter, and Remus settled into their usual seats while the players flew around. Remus munched on bacon, watching James doing loops and flips. He really did look incredible on a broom. He was a complete natural.Once Bell blew the final whistle, the Marauders hurried down, waiting until the Gryffindor broke up. Sirius ran over to Kim before she could walk off. He pulled her aside, and the other three boys went over while Sirius explained the prank to her. Kim stood listening with her broom across her shoulders, arms wrapped around them, twisting and stretching while he spoke."Activation spell?" she asked when he was done. "You mean, the Trigger spell? No, sorry, I've never done it before.""You haven't?" Sirius asked, looking disappointed.Kim gave him a strange look. "Buddy, that's a fifth year spell. I'm not learning it till next year.""Fifth year?" James squeaked out and all the Marauders looked at Remus who ducked his head, messing with his cuff."I t-t-told you it—it w-was advanced.""But you still managed to do it. A—a fifth year spell," Peter said, and Remus shrugged."You've done it?" Kim asked, sounding impressed and a little awed which made him more embarrassed."His first year," Sirius boasted, puffing his chest out. "Nearly a year ago."Kim studied Sirius, then Remus. A smile slowly spread on her face as she put the clue together. "Hah, knew you lot were behind it.""Er, behind what?" James asked, messing his hair up."The Bat-Bogey thing.""Wh—what makes you think we did that?" James scoffed, sounding vaguely panicked."Oh please!" she laughed, swinging her broom around to lightly swat James with the twigs. "The only reason nobody suspected you was because it was so advanced, but if Lupin can do the Trigger spell—that's how you did it, right? Triggered the doorway?"Sirius flapped his hand. "My point is, we need to enchant the Great Hall doors, and were hoping you could put the spell on it.""Nah. I mean, I'd love to, it sounds great, but even if I started practicing right now I wouldn't be able to get that far by Valentine's day," Kim said, sounding sad. "I'm sorry. I really hope you can figure something out."The Marauders trooped back to the school, rather disappointed. They were back at square one, and the only real thing they could possibly do was a potion. But all of them wanted to do the heart bubbles. Especially Remus. He worked hard the day before and knew it'd be a couple more days before getting it smoothed out. Getting his new spell he invented smoothed out.Couple days, Tuesday, Lily, he thought with a shudder. Then, Tuesday... "M—maybe I could see if Fawley could help us?" he asked after they went into the school, all of them glad to be out of the cold wind. "She can't come in to put the Trigger spell on the doorway but perhaps she could figure out a way regardless."James smacked his back. "Good plan. We can't just abandon this idea, it's too fun.""Would she be willing to help?" Pete asked."Probably. Possibly," he corrected himself. "She doesn't mind some of the pranks we do as long as they're harmless, and this is utterly harmless. I don't know if she'll be able to figure out a solution, but maybe."/\/\/\/\/\Remus hadn't been eating much lately and was very hungry at lunch. At least, to start. He only got a few bites down before Lily entered the Great Hall and suddenly Remus saw her in the bloodied white dress, and could practically feel her skull buckling in his jaws. He swallowed the bit of rice that had been in his mouth then pushed the plate away, the few bites sitting like heavy lumps in his stomach.The afternoon was spent focusing on getting the heart bubble spell adjusted until it worked, but nothing seemed to. He knew he was on the cusp of figuring out the right combination... he managed to get pink heart-shaped bubbles attached to people however they were still easily popped. Perhaps it was due to his age? He wasn't able to conjure unpoppable regular bubbles, though he knew others could. With that thought, he stopped trying to tweak the spell and just started practicing it over and over until the room the Marauders were hanging out in was full of pink hearts floating everywhere. The other Marauders kept popping them whenever they got too close to the boys however most drifted lazily just out of reach, bumping into one another, occasionally popping on their own.Then the others—well, James and Sirius—were bored of 'hanging around' and wanted to do 'something fun', so they left the classroom. Remus trudged along, sweaty and exhausted from all the practicing he had done. He swayed a bit, considering trying to take a nap but not wanting to deal with the possibility of another kissing-Lily nightmare."Why do people have to study in here?" James complained when they peered into the Great Hall. "I wanna do my plan.""We can sneak out in the middle of the night and do it," suggested Sirius.James nodded. "Yeah... but I wanted to see it tonight!""See what?" Peter asked, as whatever prank James was alluding to hadn't been shared with him or Remus, but Remus was too groggy to really care.James flung an arm around him, yanking him in close. "Slipping potion on the Slytherin benches," he snickered."Excellent," Peter giggled.They spent the remainder of the afternoon wandering around, James and Sirius shooting mild hexes and jinxes at various students. At one point they were running from a group of fifth years who were having a hard time chasing the Gryffindors due to the jelly leg jinxes James and Sirius placed on them. The Marauders ducked down a side corridor and ran right into Professor Prewett. Sirius—the fastest runner and in the front—went careening to the floor, knocking James over. Peter and Remus managed to stop before they got tangled up in the mess. Prewett somehow stared upright though he had to put a hand on the wall to keep himself balanced, as well as keep the cage he held in his other hand from knocking about. It was full of doxies and if that had fallen and broken open there'd be hell to pay!"S—sorry!" James cried out from the floor.Prewett frowned at the four boys and Remus felt a stab of wobbliness right in his chest, and his legs felt like he had been a victim of the jelly-legs jinx. Prewett was in extremely casual clothes and it made him look even younger than he normally did; he probably could have passed for a seventh year. He wore a dark green jumper that sported a black F on it and a pair of jeans. It just looked so nice that Remus couldn't stand to look at him another second.Tuesday, he thought, stomach whirling around. Tuesday, and these dumb, false feelings will probably stop."You four look quite guilty," Prewett said once James and Sirius got to their feet.James flashed his Potter grin. "We always look guilty, sir."Prewett snorted. "No running in the halls, and please keep an eye out. You could have caused quite a bit of chaos..." He lifted the cage, showing off the doxies. "And not a good sort of chaos."Some of the doxies gnashed their teeth at the boys. "Yes, sir," James and Sirius chorused.Then James asked, "Where did you find them?"Prewett cast a suspicious gaze on him. "I've cleared them out," he said firmly before giving them a nod and heading off. Thankfully not removing any points.James turned, opening his mouth. Remus knew exactly what he intended to say, and held up a finger. "No.""What? But—""Absolutely not. Doxies are venomous."James sighed. "Fine. Spoilsport."/\/\/\/\/\The following morning the Slytherins were having an extremely difficult time staying seated at their table. They kept sliding off and bumping into each other. The only ones who managed to stay upright were the ones gripping the edge of the table so hard they were unable to eat. Finally, Slughorn waddled down to figure out the problem and informed the Slytherins someone had put a slipping potion over the entirety of the benches. Pretty much half the Slytherins looked at James and Sirius, who were innocently eating their breakfast."This will take some time to get cleaned up so, in the meantime, the houses will have to share," Slughorn added, and there were loud groans. Technically, you weren't limited to eating with only your house unless it was a big feast, however it was unusual for students to sit elsewhere. Now there was a lot of shuffling and complaining as the benches for all the other houses grew crowded. Some Slytherins even had to sit with the Gryffindors, though for the most part the Gryffindors abandoned a large portion at the end for them.Aegis sat down next to Remus, not caring. "Did you do that?" he asked as he gathered food onto his plate. "Never mind, I am assuming you'll say no, regardless of whether you did do it or not.""You know us so well," laughed James, and Aegis smiled.At least where the Marauders sat there wasn't any trouble. Sirius was obviously slightly put off by the fact Aegis was there, but remained friendly enough. No arguments broke out during the meal. Really, the worst thing was when the post came there was quite a confused flurry as the Slytherin owls tried to figure out where their owners were. Other than that, nobody really seemed to care too much about the Slytherins sitting at other tables.Except for a few Slytherins. As kids began leaving to head to class, Remus heard Lucius Malfoy complaining very loudly about what happened, and being forced to sit with Hufflepuffs. A Hufflepuff prefect reminded him he had three tables to choose from and he chose the badgers. Malfoy mumbled something Remus couldn't hear, but the Hufflepuff prefect removed a couple points from Slytherin so it couldn't have been very pleasant./\/\/\/\/\As long as Remus didn't think about what was going to happen the next day, he managed to get through Monday fairly well. The few times it crept into his mind he began to panic and get frightened until he managed to banish it from his head again. He knew there was something very wrong with being this scared of kissing a girl, but at least now that he had had the nightmare he could pretend that was the only reason.He managed to avoid Lily for the most part until Study Group, and he considered just not going at all. If he hadn't had missed the group on Friday he probably would have skipped it; as it was, he went, and sat nervously next to Lily trying not to think of blood or kissing. It was harder than he thought possible. He wound up barely paying any attention to what the others discussed, spending most his time doodling swirls on his parchment and trying not to jiggle his foot.He kept picturing kissing Lily, and turning into a wolf. Which was ridiculous. The 30th was practically a new moon, complete opposite. Plus Fawley said it'd be safe. Course, he had only asked about spit and not—not whether or not a kiss would somehow activate his lycanthropic curse however if it was a possibility he assumed Fawley would have told him. Right?"—mus? Remus!"He jumped, blinking up at Lily. "Eh?""We're done," she laughed. "Come on.""Ooh. Er, r-right."He gathered his stuff and followed Lily through the castle, watching her braid bounce back and forth. What if he hurt her? What if the kiss made the wolf angry, and he tried to bite? What if he banged his mouth against hers too hard? What if went in for the kiss and banged her head and because he was so strong it cracked her skull open somehow?What if he was a lousy kisser?What if this didn't unlock the secret to liking girls?What if he was absolutely broken, and wrong, and—"REMUS!" Lily shrieked, as Remus stepped right off the top of a stairwell without noticing. He dropped his books and careened wildly until he grabbed hold of the railing, managing—somehow—to catch himself before he went tumbling all the way down the stairwell. There were some students at the bottom, laughing at the cascade of books and parchment, and a broken ink bottle dripping everywhere."S—sorry!" he gasped out, pulling himself to his feet.Lily ran over, seizing his arm. "Why are you apologizing?"He rubbed his elbow, feeling dumb for apologizing. "I—I don't know...""Are you okay?"He nodded, feeling embarrassed. "F—fine, yes, thanks." He quickly scurried down the stairs to retrieve his things. One of the Ravenclaws had started picking his books up, and handed them over to him with an amused smile. "Th-th-thanks," he whispered."Anytime," the boy said with a wink.As Remus hurried up the stairs he heard some of them snickering over what happened, and heard one of them say Loopy Lupin. He ducked his head, shoving everything in his bag, trying not to be sickened over the fact he had lost a bottle of ink. Lily fretted over him the rest of the way to the tower, keeping her arm linked with his to prevent any more accidents. Once inside the tower, she told him he really needed to do better about noticing his surroundings. During her mini-lecture, Peter—the only Marauder in the common room—came over. He stood to the side, listening until Lily finished."What happened?" he asked."Remus nearly fell down an entire flight of stairs," she replied.Peter frowned at Remus who shrugged. "I—I'm fine." Then he realized he could smell something rather... medicinal faintly on Peter's clothes. "What happened?""Wh-what?" Peter suddenly grew nervous. "What m-makes you think something happened?" Then he gave a high-pitched nervous laugh."Oh for Merlin's—I'll see you later, Lily!""Wait!" She grabbed hold of him, pulling him close. "Are we... I mean, tomorrow?""Yes, of course," Remus promised, only half-listening; he was too concerned about the medicinal scent."Okay! Goodnight.""Goodnight!""Honestly," Peter whispered as they went up to the dorms, "it's nothing, Pomfrey fixed Sirius—""WHAT?!" They burst into the room and Remus zeroed in on Sirius who had a bandage around one hand. A hand he quickly tried to hide behind him. "What happened?!" he demanded."Remus fell down the stairs again," Peter replied."Nonono, first of all, this isn't about me, second of all I didn't fall down the stairs, I—I caught myself before I did." He dropped his satchel and went over, grabbing Sirius's arm, pulling it back into view. "What happened?""Are you okay?" Sirius asked, ignoring the fact he had a large bandage wrapped around his hand."What happened?"Sirius looked at James, and Remus whirled around. James gave a sheepish smile as he mussed his hair up. "Everything is fine, Remy, you don't need to worry! We're fine.""Well, we did get those points removed, and two nights of detention each," Peter mumbled. James shot him a look, and Peter ducked behind Remus. "I mean, we're fine!" he promised."One of you is going to tell me what happened right this second, or so help me—"James let out a sigh. "Sirius got bit by something, that's all.""Bit," Remus said, and James nodded. He looked at Sirius who shrugged. "By what?""That's not important," James said smoothly, patting Remus's arm. "He got the antidote and the bite is—""ANTID—" Remus cut himself off and whirled on James again. "Were you lot trying to steal doxies?!""No," James said."Of course not," Sirius said."Maybe a little," Peter admitted.Remus exploded, shouting at James about how stupid they were, how utterly stupid, and how could they do such a thing, and what if they didn't get Sirius to Pomfrey on time, and did they understand how dangerously stupid they were, and why were they even trying to steal doxies in the first place when they were very venomous anyway?!Finally, he finished his shouting, and fell back, breathing heavily."I think Brains might be a wee bit annoyed," Sirius giggled."Mandrakes," Peter said."Sorry, what?!" Remus demanded, still panting."You helped us steal a mandrake for a prank," he pointed out."A MANDRAKE IS NOT VENOMOUS!" he shouted, and Peter shrank back. "Bloody hell, none of you can be alone for five minutes, can you?""Pete probably could, me an' Siri?" James shook his head. "Definitely not."Remus stormed to his bed, unable to believe how—no, no he could believe it, he definitely could believe how stupid they were. "You'll be fine?" he added, glaring at Sirius."Yup!" he promised. "It was only a small bite. Pommy got the poison out, got the antidote in me, and put stuff to heal the bite on my hand." He examined the bandage. "I'll need to reapply some tonight before bed, and again in the morning, and see her after Herbology. It's fine."Remus grumbled and grouched the rest of the night, and grumbled and grouched through breakfast, and extra grumbled and grouched through Herbology when Sirius couldn't use his hand and he had to do most the work when they were paired together."You'd do most the work anyway," Sirius reminded him, then gulped when Remus glared. "Errr... right..."All the Marauders went with Sirius for his checkup, and Pomfrey thankfully didn't kick them out. She allowed them to stand by while she looked over the bite. It still looked a little red, but she promised it was healing properly. She put more potion on it, rewrapped his hand, and sent him off with another bottle of the healing stuff to put on later.After a very awkward Defense class in which Prewett kept giving James and Sirius annoyed looks, Remus suddenly wished they could go back to the morning again. During lunch, Lily had asked Remus to meet her somewhere after Defense, and he knew what it meant, and he couldn't back out of it now. Well, he probably could... he figured Lily would understand... however, he knew he needed to do this."I'll see you guys later," Remus said after they left the classroom."Where you going?" James asked."Meeting up with Lily," he answered. "It's her birthday today, so we're... going to do some stuff together."Sirius tousled Remus's hair with his left hand. "Have fun."Fun, yeah, sure, he thought, hurrying away, ending up in the empty room before her. He put his satchel down and began pacing, chewing at his fingernails, wondering if this was really about to happen. If he was going to kiss a girl on the lips. He was twelve, he had no business kissing anyone! No, it was a mistake. He'd have to tell her no. He had plenty of time to start liking girls. Except, he didn't want plenty of time, he wanted it now so he'd stop thinking about—about certain boys. Plus he didn't have his whole life ahead of him for something like this, he only had a few years. Once he graduated, that was it. He'd be back home with nobody but his parents for the rest of his life.The door opened, and Lily came in."Hey," he said, going to his bag to pull out a present. "Happy birthday! Ah, sorry there's no... cake...""It's fine," she laughed, sitting down on the floor to open the handmade card then unwrap the presents. He had knit her four bookmarks—rather crudely made but hopefully nice enough, a small chocolate cauldron he had won from a bet, and six biscuits which his mother had sent the previous day. Very timely. It wasn't much, but Lily hugged him tightly, thanking him multiple times. She especially loved the bookmarks.They sat with their backs to the wall, talking about various things, putting off the real reason they were celebrating her birthday with just the two of them. Lily talked about turning thirteen; apparently, she had had similar thoughts that Sirius did. She'd wake up on her thirteenth birthday and suddenly things would be different. He wasn't really sure what things exactly, but he nodded and listened anyway. She asked about the bandage on Sirius's hand, and he replied he hadn't been with them when it happened and all he really knew was that Sirius had been bit by something. He knew if she knew they had tried to steal doxies she'd make a big deal, and he didn't want to go through that at the moment.Then they both fell silent, not having much else to say. Remus wrapped his arms around his knees, trying to keep his breathing steady. Lily toyed with the end of her braid, casting sideways glances at him."You... still want to?" she asked."Y—yeah," he forced out.She shifted her weight, kneeling down facing him. At least she seemed nervous too. "Okay."Remus unlatched his hands and got on his knees facing her, trying not to shake too hard. "Okay."They knelt there, staring at one another in awkward silence."You look terrified," she noted.Remus shrugged. "I—I feel a little—little scared. Er, nervous, I guess would be—be the better word," he quickly corrected, not wanting her to know that he was terrified."Me too.""Do... you... still want to?" he asked, looking up into her eyes.Lily nodded. "Yes. I think it's—I just don't want it to be this huge... thing, you know? I mean, when I kiss someone for—for real reasons. I don't want all this... pressure... for my first kiss to be... right. I don't want it to be some big deal. And—I want it to be because I want to and not cause I feel like I have to, with a boyfriend.""Yeah." He pushed some of his hair back from his face, hoping she couldn't hear how hard his heart was pounding. Then, for lack of anything better to say, he repeated, "Yeah." He began sweating, and wiped his hands off on his trousers, not sure what to even do with his hands anywayLily scooted closer, so their knees were touching, and she reached down, smoothing out her skirt. "Cassie said hers was amazing," she said and Remus tried not to frown. "Said she wished it lasted longer.""Oh." He tugged at the hem of his jumper, looking down at his lap. "How—how long is a kiss supposed to last?" He had seen his parents kissing all the time. Usually short, quick kisses, sometimes longer. One time he walked on the two of them with their arms wrapped around one another, kissing so long his younger self couldn't figure out how they were still breathing. Actually, he still wasn't quite sure. Their noses were kinda smushed up together. That had to make it difficult."I dunno. I guess it depends. I guess at least a couple seconds, to make it real."Was a one second kiss not real, then? "Oh," he said again. "Er, okay."They knelt there, staring at each other in more awkward silence.Then suddenly Lily's hands were on his face, cupping his cheeks, and her face was right there, and he began to panic—major panic. He screwed up his eyes as all the terrible possibilities of what could happen (most unlikely) ran violently through his head, and then her lips were on his.He wasn't sure what to do. Where to put his hands, or even what his lips were supposed to be doing. Did he need to put pressure back against her face? Should he put his hands on her face, like hers were with his? Were they supposed to go somewhere else? Around her shoulders? Or waist? Please, Merlin, not her waist! But, were his eyes supposed to be open? His parents closed their eyes a lot. He opened his eyes and saw Lily's eyes were closed, so he quickly closed his eyes again, but then it was over. Suddenly and quickly, and not diminishing any of the freaking-out-awkward-feelings he had inside of him.Remus opened his eyes again and the two stared at each other in even more awkward silence. Then he couldn't stand it another second and reached up, wiping his lips off on his sleeve, trying not to make gagging sounds and failing. It had felt a lot grosser than he anticipated. Not... the worst thing (it'd be impressive if anything could beat washing off his dead skin when he was burnt), but not pleasant by any means, and not an experience he wished to repeat."Ugh! Yuck!" he moaned, wiping his mouth off one more time. Lily looked less than amused at his response, and he realized why. "Er—well—that—um—it wasn't—that—when—when I said yuck, I meant—ahhh—""Uh-huh." She rolled her eyes, then at least smiled. "It was weird.""Yes," he said quickly, regretting at least the gagging sounds and the yuck. "I—I don't think I particularly like kissing.""Oh really? I couldn't tell!" she teased before sitting back with a sigh. "It... was... not what I was expecting. But I guess that might be since we're just friends.""What w-were you expecting?" He knew he had been expecting something: suddenly liking girls. Suddenly and miraculously being a regular normal boy who liked girls. But he didn't. He wasn't. He felt no different, except a little grossed out. It hadn't worked. It hadn't worked! So what was he going to do now?!She shrugged and then moved her legs so she sat flat on the floor instead of on her knees. "I don't know. Why everyone is so interested in doing it. Why everyone wants to do it all the time. Why people get caught snogging everywhere."Remus thought back to the couple he had heard snogging. "I couldn't tell you. That was... um...""Yuck?" she offered, and he flinched a little. "It's fine. I didn't mind it so much, but it wasn't anything to write home about." Why would you write home about a kiss anyway? he wondered, knowing it was just a saying but still thinking it was a little weird for the situation. "More interesting than kissing your hand, at least.""Kissing your—what?!"Lily cocked her head. "Your hand!" She held up her hand in a sort of fist shape. "You kiss there."Remus curled his fingers in, examining the edge. "Huh."There was some more awkward silence then Lily lifted her head. "Are you mad at me? I kinda feel like I pressured you into it. You obviously didn't want to, and you hated it—""What? No!" He scooted closer to her. "I'm not mad. If I—I didn't want to, I wouldn't have. It wasn't—it—it was weird and okay, yeah, yuck, but we c-couldn't have known that before, that's all.""Promise?"He reached down to hold her hand, knowing she liked that sort of thing. "I promise." She squeezed his hand, and he squeezed hers gently back. Then he thought of something, and debated saying it or not. Saying it would mean having it happen again. Which wasn't ideal. But... "Was th—that really a kiss though?""What do you mean?"He felt himself heating up, and tugged at the end of one of his sleeves. "When—when my parents kiss they—they make this sound. The sort of sound you make when you b-blow a kiss.""When you smack your lips," she said slowly.Remus nodded. "We just... sort've p-pressed our lips together without d-doing anything. Are you... s-supposed to do something with your lips? Like that?"She studied him for a few seconds then asked, "Do you want to try again?"He gulped, not sure how to answer because he didn't really want to try again, but at the same time he wanted to know if it would help. If they didn't do a proper kiss, then how could it have helped? Was that the problem? It wasn't a real, proper kiss, so of course he didn't feel different yet? He had to try again, just in case. Even though it was disgusting."If... you do."They faced each other again, and Remus felt even worse than the first time. Also hopeful. They had obviously done the first kiss wrong, and that's why it was weird and gross, right? Probably? Maybe?Her face was close to his again, and he closed his eyes waiting. Nothing happened."Come on," she said. "I did it the first time, it's your turn."Ahhhh. "I d-don't know what to do," he admitted."You pucker your lips," she said, and puckered hers. "Like that."Remus wrinkled his nose. "Do... do you move your lips when—when you kiss?""I haven't the faintest. I suppose...? I mean, if you kiss with your tongue you have to move your—""WHAT?!" Remus recoiled back, putting a couple feet of space between them. "With your what!?"Lily began giggling. "Your tongue! It's called a French kiss. You're part French so you should be able to—""NO!" He covered his mouth quickly. "N—no, I—that—the—that—I—n-n—I—""I'm teasing!" She held her hands up. "Your face went as red as a tomato. I wasn't meaning we should. I'd rather not! No offense. But that's what it's called. When you use your tongue in a kiss. A French kiss. I don't know why."Remus moved his hands to cover his face. "That sounds absolutely disgusting!""I agree with that," Lily said, and the two fell into more awkward silence.All Remus could do was think about tongues, and he felt very ill. Who wanted someone else's tongue in their mouth?! Though from what he understood about sex (which really wasn't much at all, just confusing scenes in some books he read; he knew there was a section on it in Your Body but he had very purposely avoided that section) it was a lot worse than a tongue in a mouth."Are we... um, should...?"Remus glanced over at her, and gave a slightly reluctant nod. He scootched back over to her, taking in a deep breath. This time Lily initiated the kiss again which was a slight relief he didn't need to. At first he froze up, then realized he was supposed to be puckering his lips, and he did, and it felt different but definitely not any better—actually, weirder, if he had to be honest; when they finished there was that smacking sound others made when they kissed, so he supposed they finally actually properly kissed.Annnnnnd he felt no different.Still grossed out, really.He wiped his mouth off on his sleeve while Lily pondered over the 'real' kiss they had done, and stated she felt no different either. Same, he thought miserably, having no sudden thoughts about the attractiveness of girls. It was all still a sort of blank in his head. No unlocking, no wiping away the fog... it was just... a frustrating nothing."I'm glad we did though," Lily finally said, moving to sit next to him again. "I feel good that—that it's done with, that I don't need to worry when I get a boyfriend. That I did it because I wanted to, and not because I felt like I needed to.""I'm glad you're glad," he mumbled, wishing something had changed in him; wishing he finally took that step everyone else was taking. He hated being so—so wrong! Not yet, he reminded himself, gritting his teeth. You will eventually, just—not yet..."I'm glad we're friends," she said, resting her head on his shoulder.He rested his head against hers. "Me too," he answered wholly and completely honestly.She fumbled with her hand until she slid her pinkie around his. "Forever friends, pinky promise."He curled his pinky around hers. "Forever friends."

Author's note: yup internalized homophobia again, sorry! He'll get there one day soonish! I promise!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Remus barely slept that night. He stared at the ceiling, the kiss repeating in his head over and over and over. He tried to figure out exactly what about it had been so yuck. Why he had reacted the way he did. He had hoped the kiss would make him figure things out and instead he was in even more of a quandary than before! It wasn't fair! What was wrong with him?!He lifted his hand, curling it into a fist then pressing it against his lips. It felt weird. A little like kissing Lily, though not as... damp. Her lips had been a bit damp. And his hand didn't smell like strawberries.Either way, one thing the kiss did not do was unlock the secret to liking girls. When he had gone to supper he had hoped things would be completely different, but Sirius and Professor Prewett both still gave him the fluttery feelings, and no matter which girl he looked at none of them gave him the fluttery feelings.Except, Lily admitted she didn't really feel any different, didn't really feel anything. He rolled over again, curling up, clutching at his hair. If Lily didn't feel anything it doesn't mean anything that I didn't feel anything, right? It doesn't mean ANYTHING! It doesn't mean I'm broken. It doesn't change anything. Right?Occlumency had been awkward. He told Fawley right away what happened since most likely she'd see it (which she did, though she backed out of his memory before the actual kiss which was kind of her). He wanted so bad to ask her why he felt the way he did, but didn't dare. He was scared she might assume the fluttery, gut-wrenching, sweaty-palms feelings he got for Sirius and Prewett meant he was like that, because he wasn't like that. He did, however, ask her what it felt like to have a crush on someone.She pretty much said the same thing that Lily had, as well as what he had been thinking. Fluttery, gut-wrenching, sweaty-palms—etc., etc. He asked her when she started liking boys. She had told him her first crush was at ten, which shocked him. She laughed and said while she had 'crushed' on a few boys she didn't really start properly liking them until she was thirteen or so, that's when she really took an interest. She asked if he'd like to know about her first kiss, and he said yes.It had been with a Gryffindor, actually. An older boy. She had been fifteen, he had been sixteen. It was after one of her Quidditch games ("You played Quidditch?!" he asked, surprised. Fawley laughed again, "Yes, I did, I was a Chaser for three years!") and he had kissed her in celebration. She had been expecting something sensational but "all in all, rather boring". The first kiss she had really enjoyed was with her first boyfriend, a fellow Hufflepuff later that year. They broke up shortly after, but it had been nice while it lasted."Don't feel down that your first kiss was bleh, especially at your age," she had told him.But he still couldn't help but worry that it meant he was broken, with all the other issues going on. At least he wouldn't need to worry Fawley would see him trying to snog his own hand. It wasn't anywhere near as humiliating as the 'fun alone times' she had mentioned, however it was still a little embarrassing.Finally, Remus gave up and buried his head under his pillow, clutching Gwyllgi. Unfortunately, while he did manage to get to sleep he had incredibly awful dreams that left him tossing and turning and soaked in sweat, and when he woke up he wanted to cry. He knew he had been dreaming about kissing one boy in particular, and it hadn't been a fuzzy image at all, it had been clear, it had basically been exactly what he did with Lily except he was there instead, and the kiss actually felt nice and good and 'sensational' and now Remus wanted to throw himself in the lake and die.It was four in the morning, but he crept into the bathroom for a shower anyway, turning on the cold water to try to cool down and get rid of the sweat. Huddling under the spray of cold, he wrapped his arms around his knees and cried a bit, feeling a gaping hole of emptiness inside and not knowing what to do about it. At least the cold water helped the external, if it didn't do anything for the internal. He managed to get back to sleep after, however all day Wednesday he could barely even look at Sirius, let alone be near him. What if suddenly somehow Sirius could see his dreams? It was too horrifying to even imagine."Oh! I meant to ask earlier, did you talk to Fawley last night?" James asked at supper.Remus dropped his fork and it went clattering to the floor. "Wh—what? About—about wh—what?"The other Marauders gave him funny looks, especially Sirius. "The... Valentine's thing?" James whispered.He tried not to breathe out a sigh of relief. "Oh. Oh. Um—no, I—we—we had—no. I'm sorry, I forgot. I can write to her tonight, though, if I can borrow an owl.""Did something happen?" Pete asked."Happen?""You seem upset," Sirius explained.Remus felt heat creeping across his face. "N—no. It was a very tiring lesson, that's all."They looked suspicious but didn't press him on the matter. James offered to use Godric since he was the fastest, and Sirius argued really Fili was the fastest, and James retorted that while Fili was fast he was also an arse and did they want Fawley to deal with that? Sirius kept arguing all the way to the owlery that Fili really wasn't that bad, and when they got to the tower one of the workers turned to see who came in and went right to Sirius."Your owl has been causing problems," he said, pointing to Filibuster. "He keeps standing in front of the other owls with his wings outstretched.""And?" Sirius asked with a yawn."It's rude! And—and threatening!" the boy spluttered.Sirius looked at Filibuster who seemed the picture of innocence. "He's just asserting his dominance," Sirius said coolly."Well he can assert it somewhere else or else I'll have to send a formal complaint to Professor Dumbledore, and you'll possibly need to keep him in your dorm."James, Peter, and Remus all flinched at the thought of Fili living permanently in their dorm. "Fine," Sirius grumbled, angrily raking his fingers through his hair. "I'll talk to him. Just because you lot don't know how to take care of owls..."The boy narrowed his eyes. "I literally do! I am literally in training to work at the post office, you dumb piece of hippogriff shit."Sirius smirked. "In training does not mean certified."He yanked out his wand. "Why you little—""Okay!" James chuckled, pushing himself between them. "Sirius will talk to Fili, no need to get your wand out." He put his finger on the wand, pushing it aside. "Have a good evening."The boy glared at all of them before storming out, muttering about Sirius, calling him Barmy Black."You should have let him hex me, he would have gotten into trouble!" complained Sirius as they went farther into the owlery, all their owls coming down to finally greet them. Sirius put his arm out and Fili landed on it, then promptly bit Sirius on the ear. "You been trying to show you're the most dominant owl?" Sirius asked, stroking Fili gently. Fili hooted and spread his wings out. "Good boy.""Sirius—" Remus started, then stopping, not feeling like dealing with that, not really wanting to have to look at him. "Here, James." He handed the letter over to his friend who tied it to Godric's leg, explaining that he needed to go to Miss Fawley. While he did this, Remus went to greet Arthur who seemed even droopier than usual. Arthur hooted, and Remus nuzzled him.Once they left, Remus headed to the library for Study Group while the others went off to probably cause mayhem and chaos that would give him a headache later./\/\/\/\/\At least things between Remus and Lily didn't feel very awkward after the kiss; he had worried it would be, but she acted completely normal and he wasn't bothered by it. Or rather... it didn't change anything between them. It had definitely bothered him in a continual am-I-broken-what-is-wrong-with-me way. But as far as Lily and he went, nothing seemed any different, to his great relief. She didn't act different, or bring up the kiss, or anything. Any time spent with her was the same as it always had been. He also started relaxing again with Sirius, the dream becoming fuzzier and fuzzier as time passed. It helped that he was continually reminding himself it meant nothing to Lily, so it was okay it meant nothing to him, and that didn't mean anything.It didn't.On Friday morning Godric returned with a reply, dropping the letter into Remus's lap. All the Marauders watched excitedly as he opened the letter.Dear Remus,I knew you were planning on something for Valentine's day but Merlin's beard! Don't push yourself, my dear. If you do manage to get this new spell invented then yes, I shall help. It won't hurt anyone, and sounds very amusing; I can't wait to see the results in your memories. What we can do is if I enchant a very long piece of ribbon or string. You can use the sticking spell on the doorway, and stick it around the entire doorway. That way people will 'pass under it'. I've tried this and it seems to work. I don't know how well it will work with your self-invented spell or how long it will last, however hopefully it will last all through breakfast at least. Let me know next Tuesday, and then I can bring it on the twelfth.Yours,M. FawleyRemus whispered the contents out to his friends (leaving out the bit about not pushing himself, that was silly) and they all quietly celebrated. There were many high fives exchanged which made some nearby students suspicious."Oh, we're celebrating what we did to the eggs," James said, and the students pushed the large platter of eggs away, glaring at them. James pulled the platter closer and began piling eggs on his plate, trying not to laugh./\/\/\/\/\While the Marauders trusted Fawley, they wanted to test the string thing out themselves. After lunch they went to their dorm, where Remus cut a long piece of yarn and Sirius stuck it around their doorway. James and Peter waited outside. Remus put the activation spell on the yarn, and Sirius hit it with the jelly-arms jinx. James and Peter walked through, and both got their arms jellified. They all laughed and whooped victoriously, exchanging more high fives which was very awkward with James and Peter. James didn't let Remus fix him right away, he kept running around flailing his jellified arms and smacking the others with them.They spent the rest of the free period wandering around the castle. James and Sirius sent the jelly-arms jinx to various students they came across, while Peter described to Remus the events of the latest issue of his favorite comic series. Eventually they just sorta hung around on a bench, kicking their feet, talking about random things until Sirius pointed out they still hadn't made a sledding slope indoors yet. James reminded him they were waiting until they could make it snow instead of hauling snow in, and Sirius said hauling snow in would be fine. All three Marauders stared at him."What?" he asked."YOU'RE the one who complained about hauling the snow in the first place!" Peter said."You're the one who wanted to wait till we had a spell to make it snow," added Remus. "Which, yes, I am working on however am certainly not there yet." He got his wand out and flicked it. "Chionius." Very sparse snowflakes began falling from the ceiling, melting as they touched the ground. James stuck his hand out, a few flakes falling on his outstretched palm. "Finite incantatem. See? It's not much.""Does it last?" James asked, looking at the water on his hand. "If you put the spell on a room, does it last?""Er, I'm... not sure how long it will... why? Whose room do you want to enchant?"James grinned. "Oh, anyone's really. Just curious if it would work. You know... Filch's office... we do it at night after he goes to bed—""When does ol' Filchy ever go to bed?" Peter demanded."He's got a point," laughed Sirius. "Every single time we've been about, so's he.""Does he even sleep?" demanded Pete. "I mean, are we really sure he sleeps?"James tilted his head. "Actually, I have no clue where his private rooms are. Maybe he doesn't even have a bed."Peter gasped. "Maybe he's a vampire! Has anyone actually seen him leave the castle?""Yes," said Remus, and they all looked at him in surprise. "Rather, I have not seen him leave the castle, however I know he went to the Gryffindor/Ravenclaw game last year. Myrtle told me. He wanted to see the results."Peter snapped his fingers. "There goes that idea.""If he goes to the Hufflepuff/Slytherin game later this month, we could do it," James said brightly. "He goes to Slytherin games, right? Want to do that?" he asked Remus directly.Remus shrugged. "All right. When is it?""The seventeenth."Remus flinched. "Ahh. No. I—I'm sorry, I won't be able to."James frowned, brow furrowing. "Why not?" Remus bowed his head, mumbling. "What?" James asked."I'll be... in the hospital wing," he sighed, then wanted to change the subject because he wasn't really in the mood to discuss the moon at the moment. "However, he must go to bed at some point. Even if he's creeping around the castle in the middle of the night, he most likely sleeps in the early hours of the morning. We'll simply have to stay up very late, or wake up very early.""Imagine his face when he opens his office door and finds all the snow!" Sirius giggled. "We should put a little snowman on his desk. Or a snow-cat. Could we make one of those?""Probably, but if not we could remake it into a snowman," James replied. "Okay, since we won't be getting much sleep should we do this on Wednesday morning, or wait till Saturday?""Saturday will give me more time to practice the spell, making it last longer," Remus said."Okay, Saturday then," James said, and giggled. "In the meantime we also need to practice the Valentine's prank too."Remus rubbed his forehead, feeling tired thinking about all of this. "I—I'm fairly sure the spell is correct and we only need to practice it to the point where it lasts longer than a few minutes.""Come on, let's all practice it," suggested James, so they headed to the nearest unused classroom where Remus carefully told them the pronunciation and showed them the wand movement that worked.Soon there were choruses of "Galymasitum!" and pink, heart-shaped bubbles began floating around everyone. Whenever one of them moved, their heart bubbles would follow. They weren't poppable, not even with knives (as James got his potions kit out and started stabbing at the bubbles, succeeding only in getting them to inch away from him). However, it only took a few minutes before the bubbles started deflating. Remus's attempts lasted the longest, lasting up to ten minutes. Once the bubbles deflated and sunk to the floor they finally popped, leaving a faint trace of soapiness on the ground."You are so smart," Peter said once they finally grew tired of the spell and collapsed in a corner of the room to avoid all the mess. "I can't believe you just invent spells. That's so... I mean, impossible... I mean, not impossible but... you know what I mean."Remus pushed his sweaty hair out of his face. "Th—thank you.""You're gonna be a famous spellmaker," Sirius said.Remus grew a little warm under the praise, and ducked low. "Aw, well, not—not really..." He knew how impossible that would be. Making the spells, sure, he was growing more confident in his ability to do that. However... in order to make them official he'd have to run them by the Ministry which wasn't something that could ever happen. There was a sinking feeling in his stomach and he shook his head, determined to ignore it. "But it is fun coming up with spells for pranks."James pumped a fist in the air. "True Marauder spirit!" he exclaimed, and they all laughed./\/\/\/\/\Remus still smelled strongly of soap when he went to Study Group, and Lily and Aegis both gave him strange looks though neither commented on it. He knew it was an uncomfortably strong smell, however he assumed it wouldn't be that strong for normal human noses. Oops. At least it was just soap and nothing too weird.After Study Group was over, Lily and Remus walked through the castle together slowly, chattering about various things, until they were nearly knocked over by the other Marauders running. Well, James and Sirius—Peter was lagging behind trying to stay caught up. Remus grabbed a hold of Lily right before she fell, yanking her back to her feet."Whooops!" James laughed. "Didn't see you there, Red.""You need better glasses then, Potter!" Lily grumbled, brushing herself off. "Thank you, Remus." James and Sirius eyed Remus who was still holding Lily's arm. He quickly let go, mumbling that it hadn't been anything. "Why are you lot running? No running in the halls.""No running in the halls," James said in a whiny, mimicky voice. "You wanna get that stick out of your—"Remus pounced, covering James's mouth. "James!" he hissed.Lily folded her arms. "I know perfectly well what he was going to say, and it doesn't surprise me, he's very rude."Sirius and Peter were watching all of this with amused interest, and Peter whispered to Sirius "How long till she hexes him?" causing Sirius to snort.Remus wished James would keep his mouth shut. "Why were you running?" he asked, hoping to change the topic."We hexed some kids," replied Sirius with a shrug.Lily glared at him. "You really find that fun? Hexing innocent people?"Sirius had a habit: he really liked cats, and whenever he saw one wandering around (minus Filch's cat of course) he often put his hand down to let them sniff, and then if they let him he'd pet them or sometimes pull them onto his lap. There was a cat sitting on a nearby bench watching all of this going on and Sirius finally noticed, and went over, putting his hand out. The cat stared at him with a strange expression and since it didn't run away or complain, Sirius assumed it was friendly."Yeah, it can be," Sirius said, scritching the cat behind its ears and along its cheek, watching it carefully for its reaction to make sure this attention was okay. "Honestly, we don't do anything really bad, just—"The cat changed form, and Sirius's hand was now against Professor McGonagall's waist, around where the cat's head had been.Everyone stared in astonishment."Professor!" Sirius finally squeaked, yanking his hand away from their teacher's waist, his entire face going beet red.Professor McGonagall stood up, looking down her nose at him. "And who did you hex?""Ahhh."Nobody else even made a sound, all of them too shocked to respond even though Remus finally understood why their teacher constantly smelled like a cat. He had assumed she had a cat or two, one of the many that hung around the school, but never in his life would he have been able to guess she turned into one! All the Marauders had heard rumors about her being able to become an animal but considering there were rumors like that about pretty much every single teacher (and he highly doubted Slughorn could turn himself into a slug safely), he had never thought much about it."Well?" she demanded.Sirius made a very strange gaspy sort of noise, and took a step back."I see. Ten points from Gryffindor from you and Mr. Potter, as well as a night of detention each.""Ahhh.""You're an—an—an anima—magus," Remus finally got out.McGonagall glanced over. "Very good, Mr. Lupin.""That is... amazing," Lily breathed out, eyes going wide as she stared at their teacher. "That is incredible. I didn't—I never knew—I mean, I know human transfiguration is possible but—you can—you can become a cat!""Yes. You'll be learning about animagi next year, though it doesn't surprise me at all you," she said, looking at Remus, "already know all about them.""I—" Remus started, then stopped. Part of him glowed under her praise, but part of him felt strange since the reason he did know about animagi was because he had done a lot of research into them growing up. He had hoped perhaps something about them might be connected to lycanthropy. Of course, he had been unable to do as much research as he would have liked, as books about the actual process were unavailable for sale without a permission slip from the Ministry. "Y-yes," he finally said.Lily shook her head. "But how do you transform back without your wand? It's just an—an illusion, is it? Because you looked like you transformed!""I did transform. We—" She paused, then gave Remus a smile. "Do you wish to explain? I'd like to see how much you know about this subject.""Er..." He ducked his head, twisting his fingers into the hem of his jumper. "Animagi can transform wholly and fully into—into an animal. They can't... choose which animal they become, it is their animal within. But—but they are that animal. Professor McGonagall fully becomes a cat, with—with a human's mind. Their biology is that animal, only they retain their human mind and control," he finished, trying not to feel or sound bitter. Animagi got to keep their human mind, and control over their body. He didn't. His stomach twisted itself into knots, and he pressed a hand against his belly, trying to put some pressure against it to keep himself from getting too ill. "I—I think they—they have their animal instincts too, though, if I'm not mistaken. Also, it is one of the—the few spells one can do without a wand. Since, er, you don't... have... a wand as an animal or can—can speak English.""Very good, Mr. Lupin," McGonagall said, adjusting her glasses. "Ten points to Gryffindor.""Ah—""Is it something we'll learn?" Lily interrupted."No, my dear," McGonagall said, rather gently. "It is an extremely dangerous branch of transfiguration. The process is very long, and if one does not do it correctly you could wind up permanently partially an animal. Or worse. It is so dangerous, complicated, and time-consuming that animagi are quite rare. As I said, we will learn more about them next year however feel free to take it upon yourself to study more if you so desire. Have a good evening Miss Evans, Mr. Lupin, Mr. Pettigrew.""Not us?" James asked when he and Sirius weren't mentioned."When you stop giving me a headache, I'll wish you a good evening," she said, and swished off down the hall.Once she disappeared Sirius looked at his hand. "I can't believe I just groped my teacher's waist." He kept staring at his hand, then sighed. "Ah, well, at least it was Professor McGonagall. She's gorgeous, so.""You pet our teacher," Peter said, finally speaking up."Oh Merlin, I did...""I guess this makes you the teacher's pet," Lily joked, and Sirius scowled while everyone else burst into laughter."Good one, Red!" James said, and held his hand up for a high five.Lily wrinkled her nose. "Don't touch me." She stepped away, then spun to face Remus. "I'll see you later. I'd like to chat about the whole ani... animage thing." She gave a withering look to James and then flounced off.James blew a raspberry after her, giving a two finger salute. "Cow," he muttered, and Remus glared. "I mean... er, well, so, Sirius, you groped our teacher, congrats!" He gave Sirius a light punch.Peter had been inching his way towards Remus and finally got there. "Hey," he said softly. "This is a dumb question but, that—what McGonagall is, it's completely different from you, right?"Remus was startled by this question and at first didn't know how to react. Sirius and James had heard and were now looking at him with equal interest. "Ah, er, r-right. Yes. It's v-very different." He listened to make sure nobody was around, then stepped closer to the three of them. "As I said, animagi keep their human mind when they transform and can control themselves, and they can choose to transform. I... do not. Mine is—is forced. And... I... definitely don't... keep any shred of human mind nor do I have any kind of control," he whispered, sticking his hands in his pockets to keep them from shaking. "Obviously I c-cannot change back when I wish either."Sirius reached out, messing Remus's hair up. "Least you knocked our point loss down to only ten instead of twenty, Brains."Remus forced a smile, pulling away to smooth his hair back down, trying to ignore those feelings, trying to shove the box back down, reminding himself very rapidly that it meant nothing to Lily, it was fine it didn't mean anything for him. Whatever this was would go away soon, and he'd like girls and be normal.He gave a grunt as James slapped his back before slinging an arm around his shoulders. "Now that we had that interesting encounter, let's go find some more Slytherins to hex, eh?"James hauled Remus off and the others hurried after, joking about Sirius petting McGonagall and groping her waist. Remus didn't talk much, he mostly thought about the fact McGonagall was an animagus. At least now they knew to be careful chatting about their pranks with random cats around!

"OKAY, WHO DID IT?"Remus was jerked awake early Saturday morning by Sirius's voice bellowing through the dorm room. He flailed a bit, trying to quickly get out of bed, as he was worried something bad happened, and wound up falling out of bed. He sat up, rubbing his head, and looked over to see Sirius's curtains were no longer merely red but had a crude cat face print all over them. He knew immediately it was James because they barely looked like cats.Sirius glared as Remus began laughing from the floor, but ignored him for the time being to yank back James's curtains, demanding he get up."Bloody hell, Siri, it's like 4 in the morning," James moaned as he sat up, rubbing his eyes."It's eight," Sirius grumbled. "I know you did this.""Did what?" Sirius pointed, and James slid his glasses on, his expression making it very obvious that he had been the one to do it. "Huh, wonder who did that."Sirius grabbed one of James's pillows and smacked him; his glasses went flying as he finally gave into the laughter. "Wow!" Sirius said sarcastically as James fumbled for his glasses. "Wonder who did that!"Their voices finally dragged everyone else out of bed. Peter began giggling almost as soon as he poked his head out. Spinnet launched right into complaints, wanting to know why they were being awoken so early."Cause James is a twat," Sirius said."Yes, we knew this already," yawned Spinnet. "Any particular reason you're waking us up at a miserable hour of the morning to tell us what we all already knew? And why are there hamster faces all over your curtains?""They're cat faces!" James snapped, quite indignant. Sirius raised his eyebrows, and James gave a sheepish smile. "Er, heh, at least I'm assuming..."Sirius gave him another smack of the pillow before stomping over to help Remus to his feet. "Look what you did to poor Remy.""Right, that was completely me and not you screeching," said James, rolling his eyes then grinning at Peter who was giving him a thumbs up since Sirius wasn't looking."Can we go back to bed or are you going to start shouting again?" Struthers asked. "I don't even see the big deal about hamst—uh, I mean, cat faces on your curtains.Sirius just grunted. "Oh, go back to bed, all of you. I'm getting a shower."Remus climbed back into bed, beginning to drift off right away except right when Sirius opened the door to leave, James went, "Meow."Sirius let out a roar and soon he and James were rolling all over the floor, wrestling with one another, James laughing wildly while Sirius swore furiously./\/\/\/\/\Remus didn't see the other Marauders until well after noon and as soon as he sat down James suggested they sneak into Hogsmeade since it had been a while, pointing out if they left now they could be back before too late in the evening. Sirius and Peter both agreed while Remus shook his head.James pouted. "Aw, c'mon, Remy! You liked it there.""I—I don't want to sneak out again," he said, poking at his food. "I only did it for a specific reason, and shan't do it again."James blew a raspberry. "Come on! You've done it once, what's the big deal with doing it again?"Remus kept shaking his head. "No. Sorry, but... I can't do it again. It's... I shouldn't have done it in the first place. I feel guilty enough over that as it is.""Don't you want to get drunk again?" Sirius asked innocently.Remus shot him a swift glare. "I was not drunk! I—""Yeah, yeah, happy," James said, flapping his hand. "Maybe it's a good thing if you don't go, then. I want to get loads of butterbeer and if you're there Madame Rosmerta might not sell us any."Remus turned his glare to him, while Sirius and Pete snickered. "I hope she doesn't sell you any," he said, and James gave an offended gasp."You want me to stay here, with you?" Pete offered."No, that's okay, thank you," Remus answered. "I can do homework. I should.""How much homework do you still need to do?" Sirius asked, pointing his fork at Remus."Ah—" Remus stared down at his food. Technically he was pretty much done with everything, he just wanted to go over everything, triple check it all, and probably redo a few sections of various essays. "A bit.""Mmmhmm."They left shortly after they ate, James promising to buy Remus some sweets, Remus threatening him if he did. Once they were gone he holed up in the library for a while, doing some homework before working on some ideas he had. He was getting close to doing the spell he really wanted to do—it'd be awful—but so far no luck. Eventually, Aegis showed up and the two of them left the library to go spend some time together elsewhere. At first they tried playing a card game in the Great Hall, but some Slytherins kept making rude remarks so they left, going to the Pits Passage instead. They still hadn't nicked a broom to go down into the one pit, though they both hoped they'd be able to soon.They chattered about random things until somehow the conversation turned to Muggle stuff. Remus asked him if he knew much about Muggles and Aegis shook his head."Not really. My Uncle and Aunt are... quite pro-Muggle, however we certainly know a great deal less than, say, you would having grown up with a Muggle parent. My cousin wishes to go to a Muggle museum sometime.""A... wizarding Muggle museum or an actual p-proper museum done by Muggles?" Remus asked.Aegis laughed. "The latter. I've never heard of a wizarding Muggle museum. Considering how little Purebloods know, I can't imagine it would be very... educational."Remus smiled behind his cards, remembering Sirius's face when he tried to explain a hoover. "No, probably not. It kinda b-boggles my mind, sometimes, how little James and Sirius know. It's very strange to think as sheltered as my—my home life was, how sheltered they are in other ways."Aegis nodded at that, setting a card down. "You were sheltered?""Er, y... yeah, I—I wasn't... I wasn't able to go out much.""Due to your illness?"Remus ducked his head. "That's right. It's pretty much always been just me and my parents. I... didn't really know m-many people before coming to Hogwarts, and don't know much about... wizarding society in general. It took me ages to even figure out why—why people disliked Sirius. The whole Black family thing, I mean."Aegis was giving him a strange look now. "So... you really did not know much about... the politics of some of the Pureblood families?""Not really," Remus admitted. "I'm still a bit clueless.""Ah..." Aegis flushed slightly and began focusing on his cards. Remus wanted to ask what was up, however didn't want to press him; he suspected it was the whole other-Slytherins-hating-him thing."I knew a little about the Potters," Remus said, trying to break the awkward silence. "They're always in the papers.""Speaking of which, did Mr. Potter really get rid of his broom?" Aegis inquired."Yes." Remus tried his best not to sound bitter. "He has a MoonGlide now.""Those don't come out until—""Yeah, it was specially made." Aegis frowned, and Remus realized he hadn't been able to sound impassive at all; his jealousy had come out in his tone. "You know, I realize I d-don't know," Remus said quickly, before Aegis could comment on the jealousy thing, "do you enjoy playing Quidditch? All this time and we—we never really talked much about Quidditch.""I enjoy flying," Aegis said. "I do not have any strong feelings one way or another over Quidditch, though I support Ravenclaw's endeavors to win. It's fun to watch, I'm simply not as fervent a fan as others seem to be.""I... w-wasn't feeling well, during James's first game, and wasn't able to pay much attention," Remus said. "Hopefully, his next game I can. Not sure when it is...""Against Ravenclaw," Aegis said with a smile. "March seventeenth.""Oh! That'll be—" Remus stopped, heart seizing up. "March s—seventeenth? I thought the—the Hufflepuff-Slytherin game was...""This month, on the seventeenth," Aegis explained.Remus swallowed. "Oh, all—all right...""Is something the matter?"He shook his head, holding his cards tighter. "No, I got confused over the—the dates, is all."March seventeenth, he thought miserably. A full moon. He knew James had told him at some point, but it had dropped out of his mind. The good news was it would be the first night of the full moon, so there was every possibility he could go. The bad news was he would probably be so tired it'd be difficult to pay as much attention to what was going on as he'd like. Plus if the game went on too long he'd have to leave early. Although the sun would set around 6:30, which gave them plenty of time for the game. Surely it wouldn't go on for four hours, right?"How—how long do games usually last? It seems like the last one hardly went on at all," he said.Aegis's face darkened. "The Slytherin team did not play very fairly, that's why," he said, rather icily. "Games do tend to last a lot longer, however they injured the Ravenclaw Keeper, making them bring in the reserve—who is, admittedly, very good—and they decided to go for a few quick points and then the snitch. They did not feel the need to build up points, which means they are overly confident nobody else will be scoring much. Or else they're worried Ravenclaw might get too many this season, and wanted to keep their score low.""I see," Remus said, not really understanding. "It's strange hearing someone rooting against their own House.""Very few people in Slytherin seem to be inclined to feel comfortable being seen with me," Aegis said tensely. "It is difficult to root for Slytherin when hardly any appear to care for me.""That—that is understandable. You were wanting to be in Ravenclaw?""Yes, most Silverlockes end up in Ravenclaw," he replied. "I assumed I would too. I hoped I would be.""I can see you in Ravenclaw." Remus immediately flinched as soon as the words were out. "I—I didn't mean... ah, that probably sounded rude since you wanted—and you're not—""It's fine," he promised, not sounding mad. Hopefully not sounding mad. "I was thinking of asking Pandora to come to Study Group sometime soon. I know we don't choose our electives until April, however I figured if we talk to her soon that will give us time to think about what she said.""That sounds good to me," Remus said, wondering how in Merlin's name he was going to choose.The conversation shifted to other things, and wound up on the topic of Valentine's. Remus considered asking Aegis whether or not he found girls of interest. He never really talked about that sort of thing. With Sirius having obvious interest in girls (and kissing them already—on purpose, not 'to see' like Remus had), Peter making it clear he liked girls, James occasionally saying things, and Lily often chatting about boys... it'd be nice to know if Aegis was more on the Not Yet side of things. If he was. Which he might not be, maybe he did have a lot of interest and simply never spoke of it.However as much as Remus wanted to know, he didn't dare. It would probably be too personal, and he didn't want to intrude.Still, it would be nice to know he wasn't alone in the Not Yet camp./\/\/\/\/\James was far too energetic in the morning, bouncing around as he got ready for Quidditch practice. Peter and Remus opted to stay in bed for more sleep while Sirius went to watch the practice. Remus slept on and off until well after eleven, and at that point Peter was awake, ready for the day. The two of them went down for an early lunch, Peter telling Remus all about their Hogsmeade visit the day before since the others hadn't had much of a chance to talk to him privately.Remus was mid-yawn when Peter said, "Oh you know that haunted house?"Remus snapped his mouth shut. "Er, y—yeah?""'Parently some locals tried breaking in the other day," Pete said, eyes going big. "They got caught trying to use the blasting curse through some of the boarded-up windows but the spell re—re—rebonded back—""Rebonded?""You know, it, um, bounced back."Remus searched his brain to figure out what 'rebonded' might be. "Re... bound?""Yes, that's the word Madame Rosmerta used," said Peter with a nod. "Sent the kids flying back, hurt them pretty bad. It's kinda weird to think that someone's put so many spells up on that place to keep people away. I wonder what goes on in there." Remus gave a noncommittal sort of noise, putting his hands in his pockets to hide the shakiness. "James says we're gonna sneak in at night to listen.""Th—that's a very bad idea," Remus said quickly.Peter sighed, trying to mess his hair up in a similar manner that James did, but since James's hair was thick and naturally wild, and Pete's hair was rather thin and straight all he succeeded in doing was making a slightly tangled mess and not the flyaway sort of mess that James managed. "You surprised?""N... no. Who would be surprised James has a bad idea?" Remus asked, and Peter laughed.They had just reached the second floor when they passed some older Gryffindor students. One of them stopped, turning to face them. "Hey!" she said, and Peter and Remus both froze, assuming Sirius and James had done something. "Lupin." She walked over, her prefect's badge flashing in the light. "Professor Dumbledore wants to see you.""M... me?"She gave an annoyed sigh. "Yes. Wasn't told any particular time so..."Remus nodded, taking a step back. "I—I guess I'll s-see you later," he told Peter. The prefect was giving him a curious and rather smug look, as if figuring he was in trouble. Which he might be. Was he? What had he done recently? Well, loads of things with the Marauders however as far as he knew he hadn't really done anything worthy of seeing Dumbledore.Remus made his way to the corridor outside Dumbledore's office and wound up stuck outside since he wasn't sure what the password was. "Pepper imps," he said, hoping it'd be the same thing as last term. The gargoyle stared blankly. Blast, he thought, shifting his weight. "Chocolate f-frog? Er, cauldron cake. Ahh... chocoballs?" He began going through various sweets and when he got to gummy butterflies the gargoyle moved. He figured that was the password, but when the gargoyle finished moving Remus found himself looking up into Dumbledore's eyes."Ah, Mr. Lupin. Come in. I apologize for not sending the password to you."Remus stepped onto the moving staircase behind the headmaster. "I—it's ok—kay, sir."As soon as they went into his office, Remus noticed Dumbledore's phoenix was at the end of its current cycle. It looked on the verge of bursting into flames any second. Remus eyed it, then scurried to sit in the chair Dumbledore indicated."How are you doing, Mr. Lupin?" Dumbledore asked as he swept into his seat, locking his pale blue eyes on Remus."Ah—er, I—I'm—f-f-fine. S-sir. Thank—thank you.""Are classes going well?"Remus floundered, really unsure what was going on. "Y... yes, sir. Yes, ah—classes are—are w-wonderful.""No issues with any of the teachers?" Dumbledore inquired."N—no," he whispered, then thought about Slughorn pressing him about the Slug Club. That didn't really count though, right? "Everything is g-g-good."Dumbledore smiled. "How are the occlumency lessons?""Er, f-fine. Miss Fawley is... a wonderful t-teacher.""Good. And your friends? Is everything... well with that?"Remus thought he detected something heavier with the way Dumbledore asked that question over the others. "Very—very good," Remus answered, trying not to sound too anxious.Dumbledore's eyes twinkled as he asked, "Getting into plenty of trouble with them?""Ah—hopefully n-n-not too much." Remus looked down, tugging at the end of his jumper sleeve, twisting his fingers into the loose wool. "I t-t-try not to, at—at least.""The four of you seem very close."Remus glanced up, not sure what to say since it didn't seem like a question. "Y—yes?""In fact, it seems as though I don't see any of you without at least one of the others, usually all four together," Dumbledore continued."We—yes, we spend—we're t-together a lot." He suspected he knew what Dumbledore was going to ask, and if he did then that meant Fawley truly was keeping his secrets.When Dumbledore spoke the words, they pierced into Remus. "They don't know? Or suspect?"He doesn't know? Remus lifted his chin, focusing on keeping his breathing steady to avoid panicking. His stomach yanked itself up into his throat, and he clenched his teeth to keep the bile back. He wasn't sure if he could do this. Lying to his parents was hard enough, but lying to the most powerful wizard in the country—probably the world—who had done so much for him, risked so much for him? Could he?He managed to somehow put a vague sort of smile on his face and said, "No", lying right to Albus Dumbledore's face."If they ever suspect anything, you will come right to me," Dumbledore said. It was an order."Yes sir," Remus whispered."Even though I am sure you trust them, it is still exceedingly dangerous for them to know," he said, very firm. Very intense. "It is unsafe for werewolves to be very close to those who don't know. The hatred against werewolves is strong, and can break the bonds of even the closest of friendships or even family or romantic relationships." His voice grew heavier, pressing down on Remus. "While it may seem easy to trust them... I must warn you that even those we feel that we can trust wholly and explicitly can turn against us without warning. They are your friends, but you cannot fully trust them. You understand that, correct? You cannot fully trust them."Remus squirmed under Dumbledore's penetrative gaze. He wondered if the headmaster was using legilimency. Surely he'd be able to tell if Dumbledore was doing that or not, right? "Yes... sir..." he forced out, trying to empty his mind just in case, trying to put up his wimpy barrier."Now." Dumbledore's smile returned, and he put his hands on his desk, linking his fingers together. The heaviness was gone. It felt as though a dark cloud had been brushed aside. "I brought you here to inform you of some things that happened in Hogsmeade last week."Remus opened his mouth to ask if he meant the attack on his house then quickly shut his mouth, realizing there'd be no way for him to know unless he (or someone he knew) snuck in. "Wh—what happened?"Dumbledore's expression turned slightly curious for a second or two. "Three young wizards decided to try to break into your house. They were unsuccessful, as my charms and wards on the place are very strong. However, due to the rather violent reaction, there has been some gossip about the house. I thought I should let you know, in case anyone tries anything while you're there. That way hopefully you don't panic or get frightened."Remus has the sneaking suspicion that Dumbledore had actually brought Remus to his office to warn him about his friendship with the Marauders, not this. But he nodded. "Yes, th—thank you. I shall be very c-careful."A few minutes later Remus was heading back down to the Great Hall, mind whirling. Did he read my mind? he wondered as he wandered through the halls, more aimlessly than he realized. What if I told them they do know and they still like me? And will keep it secret? Would he still erase their memories? How can Dumbledore not know though? How can he say I can't trust them? I can trust them. But of course he doesn't know I can trust them.Remus yelped as he ran into a statue, nearly tumbling to the ground. A nearby painting laughed but thankfully there weren't any students around to see him. He rubbed his nose and glanced around, realizing for some reason he had gone to the third floor, not down towards the Great Hall at all. He was more out of it than he thought.He sighed, slumping down on a nearby bench. They're good friends, of course I can trust them. He understood Dumbledore's concerns. He had thought the same before everything happened, right when they told him. Those moments were a little foggy, but he remembered being terrified they had called the Ministry.He considered going back to confess, except he had a nagging feeling that no matter what he said it wouldn't change Dumbledore's mind, and the Marauders would be obliviated.I do have to be careful, he thought, finally getting back up. He had to protect his friends, and that meant making double sure nobody besides Miss Fawley figured out that the others knew./\/\/\/\/\Naturally the other Marauders wanted to know what Dumbledore wanted, and Remus wasn't sure how to reply. He didn't want to tell them the truth: that he was being warned about being too close to them. He didn't want to tell them the lie: that his house had been attacked, because they couldn't know that that was his house. So he went for the first things discussed: whether he was doing all right with Prewett, and with his occlumency lessons."Just a check up?" James asked, sounding disappointed."Yes," Remus answered, hiding a smile. "We didn't get in so much trouble Professor Dumbledore had to step in."James snapped his fingers. "Drat."Sirius was giving him a strange look. "Is that really all?""Y—yes." He knew his stutter gave it away, and Sirius raised an eyebrow. "Er—there were a—a few other questions. Private.""About your furry little problem?" James asked as he stuffed food into his mouth.Remus groaned. "Yes, and please stop calling it that.""I'm just glad you're okay and it wasn't you getting into trouble," Peter said, nodding. "I couldn't imagine you getting in trouble instead of them, but I was worried.""Thank you."/\/\/\/\/\That night he had a nightmare, though it wasn't one of his typical ones. It started out with the Marauders walking through a soapy corridor, talking about various things until James started up with the furry little problem thing again. They stopped walking and James began shouting about it for some reason and then a nearby cat turned into Professor Dumbledore. A-ha! he said, brandishing his wand which had a silvery sort of gleam to it. Remus begged him not to do anything but Dumbledore said it was too dangerous, and began obliviating James, Sirius, and Peter. Dumbledore disappeared, and Remus tried talking to the Marauders but they had gone back to the beginning of the first year, only worse. They all began calling him Loopy Lupin, laughing, Why would we want to be friends with a lunatic like you? Their laughter grew louder and louder and Remus fell down, covering his ears, crying as they pointed at him, calling him names.When Remus woke up, it was quiet. He wasn't screaming or thrashing or anything, however his cheeks were very damp. He brushed the tears away, staring at the curtains, half wanting to wake them up to make sure—they were still friends, right? He knew he was being ridiculous. It was just a nightmare, of course they were still friends. They hadn't been obliviated.It took him forever to get back to sleep and when he got up in the morning he could hardly breathe as he got out of bed. Sirius and James were both up already, James chattering about something or other while Sirius fixed his hair in the mirror. Remus sat on the edge of his bed, trembling violently, wanting to ask if they knew who he was.Sirius glanced over and gave Remus such a weird look that Remus almost threw up, scared his nightmare had been real. Terrified Dumbledore had obliviated them in the night somehow. Deep down he knew it hadn't happened, it had been a nightmare, but part of him was worried it had actually happened."You all right?" Sirius asked, fingers moving to tie his tie."M—me?""No, your pillow. Yes you!""Oh. Um—yeah. Yes.""You look out of it," James said, bouncing over. "You get sleep?""Yes," Remus said, relieved. "Bad dreams is all.""You didn't..." Sirius trailed off, frowning. "Scream," he finally said.Remus got out of bed, going to the wardrobe to rummage for a clean uniform. "No, they weren't that bad."The last of his fears disappeared when James shook Peter awake, and Peter was the same as always. They all were. It had only been a horrible nightmare. The only problem was, dream and reality were sort of bleeding into one another again... like they had with the glitter nightmare. And that was kinda scary too.

Remus felt on edge all day Monday and every time the four of them were alone he grew paranoid that Dumbledore would come out of nowhere with his wand to erase their memories. The others noticed how jumpy he was, but he promised he was fine. None of them brought up his lycanthropy, though James did mention the house, telling Remus the same thing Pete and Dumbledore said, and reiterated how much he wanted to sneak in some time to listen."Maybe we can do it Friday night," he suggested, eyes sparkling."Maybe we sh-shouldn't at all," Remus muttered, running his fingers nervously along the strap of his satchel. "It's extremely risky.""That's the fun part," laughed Sirius, and James grinned while Peter made a face."We're Gryffindors, we do risky stuff!" added James.Remus shook his head. "No, you do risky stuff because you're idiots. Think of how much trouble you'd be in if you were caught!"James put his arm around Remus. "We've never been caught going in and out of Hogsmeade yet! Besides, this is less dangerous! After all, we won't be wandering around the town. We'll just... come in and... go near the house to hear what all the fuss is about.""You're in, right?" Sirius asked, elbowing Peter."Ahh—yes. Yes, of—of course," Peter squeaked, clearly not wanting to be in at all."See?" Sirius turned his gaze to Remus. "Petey's in.""It's settled. Friday night." James squeezed Remus gently."I thought we were going to wake up early on Saturday to prank Filch's office?" Remus asked, hoping to be able to put the sneaking out until a much later date. "I've been practicing the snowing spell."James looked rather chagrined. "Er, right. Yes. We can do that—well, okay, we can do that Saturday morning, then sneak out on Saturday night. Yes, perfect, we'll do that. Now, come on, it'll be better if it's all four of us."He wanted to say no, knew he should say no. Sneaking into Hogsmeade was wrong, being out after hours was wrong, doubling up on that was super wrong! If it were for anything else he'd say absolutely not. However... part of him wanted to be there in case they heard a wolf howling, to try to steer their minds away from the thought of that's where Remus went on full moons. If they knew where he went... well, he had a bad feeling they'd try to show up sometime. He'd probably be able to convince them not to. Probably. It just seemed like it'd be a bad idea to let them near that house by themselves where they could hear the screams and howls.What if... some of the screams sounded like his own voice? Would Dumbledore do that? To hide his own screams during the full moon? Would he have enchanted the place to sound like that? Or would that be too much?He couldn't be sure, and that meant most likely he'd need to be with them to make sure they didn't start suspecting things."Maybe," he croaked out. James slapped his back so hard he began coughing."Thattaboy!" James said triumphantly. "Saturday night it is."Remus felt violently ill./\/\/\/\/\Tuesday evening one of the first memories Fawley saw—after easily ripping through his barrier—was Dumbledore's warning. Once she left his head, Remus told her about the nightmare he had, and how afraid he was of his friends losing their memories of him. Fawley rubbed his back, admitting she wasn't sure how much she could reassure him, because if Dumbledore did find out, it would mean their memories would be wiped."If he finds out, I can try to talk to him," she said, giving him a gentle hug. "I don't know if it will do any good, but I'll do my best."Remus sniffled, nodding. "Th-thank you, Miss Fawley."She sighed. "How have I become an advocate of this?" she asked, and then gave a laugh to show she wasn't really annoyed by it. "James has Quidditch these evenings, right?""Y—yes.""I would like to talk to him again, and Peter. Perhaps next week you can bring Peter with you. Sometime later we can work out an evening where I can come to talk to James."They went back into his head, pouring through various memories while he tried to fight back. At one point he felt a very sharp stab of pain in his head, and the memory stopped. He fell back, pressing his hands against his head, groaning a little in pain as the stabbing continued."Remus—""I'm a-all right," he gasped out, curling forward. "I think.""Remus, you pushed me out of your head."Remus froze, eyes slowly opening as he stared straight ahead. "Wh... what?" He looked up, unable to believe his ears."It... wasn't much of a kick out, if I had fought against it I would have stayed in," she explained carefully, "however this is the first time you've managed anything like that.""It's—what? I did what?""The little bit of a barrier you normally have is only when I enter your head. This time you yanked it back up in the middle of me looking through a memory!""I what?!" He straightened up, hands falling, chest heaving. "I did—I—I'm—""Yes," laughed Miss Fawley and suddenly they were hugging, both of them laughing. Tears dripped down Remus's face—happy tears, very happy tears. "This is amazing. You—this isn't something—you're only twelve and—Remus, do you have any idea how impressive what you've just done is? Only a natural should be able to do something like that at your age, like Sirius. I've known people to study Occlumency for years and only manage what you're doing after a long time."He wiped his face off, trying to avoid sniffling so she wouldn't know he was crying. "I p-probably won't ever be able to—""No! There will be no self-depreciation here right now, Mr. Lupin, do you understand me?"He nodded. "Y—yes, Miss Fawley."She reached out, stroking his hair gently. Unlike when his mum did it over the holidays, he didn't mind at all. That slipped right into him feeling incredibly guilty for not minding Miss Fawley doing this, but not wanting his mum to. Suddenly he didn't want Miss Fawley doing this—except no, he really did, it felt so nice... but he shouldn't not mind her, but mind his mum, and—argh, it was a big mess in conjunction with the incredible joy from a few seconds ago, and he wanted to hide somewhere for a while."How do you feel?" Miss Fawley asked, as if she knew what he was thinking."C—confused, I guess?"She smiled. "No, I mean... your head is hurting, right?""Oh! Yes. It's... hurting pretty bad.""Let's take a short break, then."Of course he wasn't able to do it again, nor could he put up the minute initial barrier. They ended the session a bit earlier since it was clear he was too exhausted, and they parted with two promises: Fawley would bring the enchanted ribbon next week, and Remus would talk to Peter and James about meeting up with her sometime.He was in a very good mood, practically skipping along the corridors despite the pain in his head. Instead of going to his dorm, he instead headed towards the kitchen to get something to celebrate with. A small piece of cake or something. The house-elves were quite pleased to give him a container with a piece of cake, and he thanked them profusely before leaving.I hope I can do it again next week, he thought as he took some back corridors and secret passageways to get to the dorm quicker. I can't believe I did it. Is it really that shocking for someone to get to this point already? I feel like I'm not progressing at all, so...Remus turned down a corridor then froze. There was a figure halfway down, leaning slumped against the wall, head down. Remus could smell blood. He hesitated, not sure whether to leave them alone or not but the student lifted their head and Remus nearly dropped his container when he saw it was Aegis."R—Remus!" Aegis said in surprise when Remus took a few steps forward. There was bright red blood smeared on his lips and chin, with more dripping all over his uniform."What happened?" Remus demanded, closing the space between them."Oh. Nothing," Aegis said, hand fluttering to his face. That's when Remus noticed there were faint streaks of tears on his cheeks.Remus frowned. "Th—that is a lot of blood for n-nothing.""I... got into a fight," he admitted."You? In a fight?"Aegis flushed slightly, quickly pulling his jumper up to wipe off some of the blood. "Fine, he fought me and hit my nose with a rather vicious hex."Remus set his stuff down and rummaged in his satchel till he found a handkerchief and water. He got the handkerchief wet and handed it to Aegis who thanked him, wiping his face off."Who did it?" Remus asked, folding his arms.Aegis avoided his eyes. "Doesn't matter.""Yes it does—""Please." Aegis looked at the bloodied cloth. "I—I'll get this cleaned and returned to you.""No, it's—you can keep it," Remus said, giving Aegis a worried look. "Was it... Malfoy?"Aegis flinched very faintly, and Remus knew he was right. "No, it... doesn't matter at all," he murmured as he searched his pockets for a hair tie. His hair was down, and a mess. A scraggly mess, with a few flecks of blood in there as well. He ran his fingers through his hair—wincing a bit—before pulling it back. He noticed Remus staring at a particularly bloody section, and sighed. "Some of my hair was pulled out.""Who did this?"Aegis just smiled, letting his hands fall. "How is your evening going?"Remus grit his teeth. "It was Malfoy, wasn't it?""Remus..."They stared at one another, and Remus decided to let it drop for now. "Would you like some cake?" He offered out the container.Aegis shook his head. "I am not very hungry. I appreciate it, though."They talked for a bit longer and then Remus offered to walk Aegis back to the Slytherin common room, which made Aegis laugh. His eyes crinkled up and he thanked Remus, but of course turned him down. After their goodbyes, Remus headed off then doubled back, sneaking along as best he could out of sight, keeping an eye on Aegis as he trudged back to the dungeons. A few kids gave Remus strange looks but nobody gave him away. Soon, Aegis disappeared through the Slytherin entrance without any issue, and Remus hurried to the Gryffindor tower.He had no proof it was Malfoy but... heavily suspected it was. His stomach burned with anger, and the wolf paced around as his temper grew. He kept seeing the blood on his friend's face, and hearing him admit his hair had been ripped out. It wasn't fair... why the hell was Aegis such a target? He wished Aegis would trust him... Remus would never judge him for whatever it was everyone else seemed to be judging him on.Sirius would know, he thought as he went into the common room. That, though, would be a huge betrayal. No... as curious as he was, if Aegis didn't want him to know then he wouldn't know.Sighing, he put his cake in his desk drawer, no longer feeling like celebrating./\/\/\/\/\The Marauders were, once again, the subject of Study Group on Wednesday night thanks to James and Sirius doing the slime fountain spell in a bunch of loos earlier in the day. They had, of course, been caught... not that they had particularly tried to avoid being caught, in Remus's opinion. In any case, Twycross ranted for ages about them and how they were an embarrassment to the Gryffindor name."Look, if you're going to spend all of our time here complaining about them, let me know," Bones said, cutting her off. "That way I can go and actually get work done."Twycross's mouth snapped shut, and she glared. "Right. Well." She gave an insulted sniffle. "I believe my point has been made.""A thousand times over," Aegis muttered under his breath. Remus snorted, fairly certain he was the only one who heard that.Sometimes Study Group lasted till after seven-thirty, sometimes it was just an hour long and ended at seven; tonight was one of the nights it ended at seven (mostly due to Twycross annoying everyone) so Remus went to sit across the hall from where Peter's photography club was held, reading for a few minutes till the door opened.Peter was one of the last ones out and his face broke into a smile when he saw Remus. "Study Group end early?" he asked, shouldering his camera bag.Remus stood up, tucking his book in his satchel. "Yeah, Twycross was... well...""Being Twycross?" Pete asked, and Remus smiled. "Well, thanks for coming to get me, that's really nice of you.""How did tonight go?"Peter chattered away about some sort of process they worked on and Remus nodded, having no idea what Pete was meaning but enjoying listening to him talk about something he loved. Then, suddenly, Peter made a turn down a rarely used corridor and Remus followed, asking him why they were going that way."Mulciber, Avery, and Bulstrode like to hang out the other way and cause problems," Peter explained miserably. "One time when nobody was with me and I took that way they attacked me.""What? When?""Last term. I dunno if they still hang out there but I don't wanna risk it."Remus stopped in his tracks. "They harass students?" As he said it he realized that's something the Marauders did often; hang about in a corridor while James and Sirius hexed random students. "Is it very awful harassment or little hexes?" He grew uncomfortable asking that, knowing how hypocritical he was being, getting upset about this.Peter stopped too, turning to face Remus. "Kinda bad hexes. Last time I went by they were trying to use some spell I never heard of. It sounded scary. I think they're there most nights but... why?""They're setting themselves up for a nice prank if they're in the same spot every week," Remus answered, and Peter grinned. "I'd say we should do something now, but we need something good, especially if they're badgering others.""Next Wednesday is Valentine's day," Pete pointed out. "The Photography Club's been asked to take pictures of the dessert.""Oh, they are doing that again?""Uh-huh. I wonder if Sirius is gonna take Inkwood. I wish I had someone to take. If you could take anyone, who would you go with? Evans?"Remus stiffened a little, not liking this course of conversation. "Ah—nobody, really. It... isn't something that interests me. Besides, I'll have Study Group that evening."Peter arched his eyebrows. "You'd really rather do homework?""Yes?"They stared at each other for a few seconds and Remus realized he probably should have said of course he'd prefer taking a girl to a fancy Valentine's dessert than do homework. Except studying was infinitely the more interesting choice! It... just wasn't the choice he should probably take if he wanted to be a regular guy. Whoops."Who—who would you t-take?" Remus asked quickly, hoping Peter wouldn't think he was too weird. Perhaps... he should take someone? Except, the second he thought that he got a stomachache."Ummm... I dunno. Someone, anyone! It'd be nice." He went faintly pink. "Not that anyone would go with me."Remus elbowed him. "Don't say that. You're absolutely brilliant. Anyone would be lucky to go with you.""Not like the rest of you," he muttered, anxiously messing with his hair. "You're all good-looking and I'm bleh, plus you all have other stuff going for you. I don't—""All right, w—wait a minute, first off I am far from good-looking!" Remus protested. "I'm... small and—and sickly and—""I've heard girls call you cute," Pete said.Remus opened and closed his mouth a few times. "Wh—what? What? No, I—""Yeah.""Um, what girls? Was it Lily? Because she is biased and doesn't count."Peter shrugged. "No. Well, I guess yeah, but she wasn't the only one. Inkwood and Colgate both agreed you were cute. Said you remind them of a puppy dog. Small and cute.""Ahhh—wh—no?" Remus couldn't believe what Peter was saying! Obviously he had overheard their discussion wrong. "No! That's... completely wrong." He felt uncomfortable. He didn't like the idea of girls discussing him like that! Though... he had discussed them a little bit, therefore it'd be weird to be upset over them talking about him. But still. It made no sense. In any case, he didn't want to even think about it, so he switched the topic back to Peter. "Anyway, you look good. You are very good-looking, okay? And you've got a lot going for you! You're super nice, and very talented. Not to mention very sweet.""Thanks... but I think girls prefer Sirius's good looks and charm over sweet and nice," he sighed."Pete, we're—we're twelve. Er, well, you're thirteen. Does it—is it really important to worry about what girls think right now?" Remus inquired. Peter gave him such a taken-aback-look that he knew he messed up again. Obviously he should be worried about what girls thought of him."Sirius talks about kissing all the time, and he's—he's practically dating!""Well, that's Sirius," Remus said, not wanting to talk about Sirius and Inkwood at all. Or this entire conversation. He partially regretted swinging by to get Peter if all he wanted to do was talk about girls. Then Remus realized he sparked this by asking Peter who he was taking, in order to pretend to be a normal guy. If he was a normal guy he wouldn't mind this. "Everyone... grows at a different rate. Such as our voices changing. We're all going to get there in the end... just at different rates. We'll all get girlfriends eventually..."Remus swallowed at that, looking down at his shoes. He didn't want a girlfriend. Though he should want one. What if... he had to pretend for the rest of his school days? That'd be awful, and vastly unfair to any girl he pretended with. Of course... as a werewolf he probably shouldn't date at all. That was what his father was warning him about over summer. He wouldn't be able to have a real relationship, so... should he bother pretending?"I want to know what it's like," Peter said with a pout."What, having a girlfriend?""Yes! And—and kissing."Remus started to say kissing wasn't all it was cracked up to be, then realized he shouldn't admit to kissing. He did not want his friends to know he had his first kiss—a practice kiss, true, but still a kiss—with Lily. They would never in a million years change their minds that Remus and Lily were a couple if they heard that!"Kissing sounds awkward. Do you really want to—to swap saliva with some girl?""Yes!" Peter groaned. "I do! Don't you?"Remus wasn't sure what to say. Nausea spiked in his stomach as he tried to figure out how to get out of a real answer. No, he didn't want to swap spit with a girl! However saying that would be too weird, and he didn't want to outright lie and say yes, and he doubted saying 'maybe one day' would work either; obviously he should be wanting to at this point. So what to say?"I... don't particularly find the idea of someone else's spit in my mouth to be enjoyable," he finally settled on.Peter snorted, shaking his head. "If you put it like that it sounds disgusting. But if it was really disgusting why does everyone do it?""I can't answer that question," Remus replied honestly. "Perhaps soon you'll find out.""I hope so. But I doubt it. Sirius is gonna date Inkwood and James is gonna get a girlfriend and you and Ev—" Peter stopped, noticing Remus's glare. "Er, you and someone will get together, and I won't ever." He gave another groan, slumping against the wall and covering his face. "I'll just be pathetic Pokey Peter Pettigrew left in the dust."Remus folded his arms, hunching a bit. "I doubt you'll be left in the dust. I stand by what I said earlier, any girl would be lucky to have you."Peter looked up at Remus, finally managing a small smile. "I dunno 'bout that but... thanks.""I'm right about most things, aren't I?" Remus teased.Pete rolled his eyes and pushed himself away from the wall. "You sound like James now."Remus puffed his chest out and began messing up his hair, which sent Peter into peals of laughter. Remus laughed too, quickly fixing his hair. They elbowed each other a few times then headed to the Gryffindor tower, Remus exceedingly relieved that conversation was over. He hoped he wouldn't have to have another along those lines for ages./\/\/\/\/\Remus spent most of Thursday working on homework assignments as well as practicing making it snow. They still intended to get up super early on Saturday to make it snow in Filch's office. Early enough that it would be 'after hours' (before hours?), and Remus felt anxious about that.Right before suppertime, he went up to the owlery to send off a letter to his parents. James, Sirius, and Peter were all off doing something (he wasn't sure if he even wanted to know what they were doing) so he was by himself which made him a little nervous, hoping he wouldn't run into Mulciber and Avery. It wasn't a great feeling, being anxious about walking through the school alone. Thankfully he made it to the tower without issue, and put his winter cloak on before slipping through the door.Owls began complaining pretty much right away. Remus sighed, wishing he didn't have this effect on them. It made him feel bad. He hated scaring animals. "Arthur?" Arthur flew down, landing shakily on Remus's arm and hooting. Remus nuzzled him gently and moved to sit on the floor, letting Arthur balance on him. "Hey there," he whispered, pulling a treat out of his pocket. Arthur nipped lovingly at his fingers before taking the treat. "How are you doing?"Arthur hooted again, biting Remus's nose very gently. Remus very carefully ran his fingers along Arthur's body, applying very slight pressure to see if Arthur was doing all right. Arthur bent forward and bit at Remus's ear, causing him to giggle."Hey that tickles!" he laughed, pulling back. "Silly boy." He nuzzled Arthur again who nuzzled back. He looked so tired and worn out. Remus stroked him, debating whether or not to use him. He didn't really have any way to get a letter back to his parents, unless he got one of the Marauders to attach the letter to the school owl. "Are you... up for a trip?"Arthur snuggled closer and Remus continued petting him, wishing he could talk to Arthur, or rather understand what Arthur said. He wished he knew how weak Arthur felt."Maybe I should use a school owl," he murmured. Arthur gave an angry squawk and flapped his wings. "Oh—hey, calm down, it's all right." Arthur began pecking at Remus's pocket for the letter. "Look, I'm just worried about you!" Arthur stuck his beak in the pocket and pulled the letter out, giving Remus a look. Remus sighed. "All right, all right. You win. but be sure to rest plenty on the way, okay?" Arthur headbutt him very lightly. Remus rubbed his head. "Please be careful."Arthur gave one last hoot then flew off. Remus got to his feet, going to watch him out the window, flying off into the dusk. Remus watched him until he couldn't see him anymore, then hugged the cloak around himself, shuffling to the door, trying not to worry.

Author's Note: Hey guys I just want to say thank you SO SO much to everyone who is leaving comments here! I've said before I don't mind if people don't leave comments, I want everyone to consume the story how they want. That is absolutely a-okay with me! But I did want to thank those who are leaving comments. It really helps me, and means more to me than I can ever say. I appreciate it, and you! Thank you!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\When Remus woke up Friday morning, he knew it was going to be a bad day. The voices of his friends felt like blades under his skin, and when Sirius offered to help him with his tie Remus almost flinched back, mumbling that he didn't mind the points removed. Sirius gave him a curious look but didn't press.What did I do to deserve this? he wondered as they headed down to breakfast, Remus being very careful to walk at enough of a distance that he didn't bump into any of them. Nothing particularly bad happened the day before, and he hadn't had any nightmares. It wasn't fair to wake up and have these issues out of nowhere. What had he done wrong?Breakfast was horrible. All the voices and noise slipped into Remus and he wanted to scratch at himself to get rid of the itchy feelings. He didn't eat much, he mostly spent his time poking at his food and going over the events of the day before to try to figure out what caused this. Was it Wednesday? The talk with Peter? Or getting into trouble? Wouldn't that have caused problems the previous day?Finally Remus pushed his food away, an idea forming in his head. He didn't want to give in—shouldn't give in—but he was already hating everything so much he didn't want to deal with more problems. "I—I forgot something, I'll be right back," he said, and hurried off. If he was quick, he'd be able to get to the dungeons in time.He sprinted to the Gryffindor tower (falling several times) and slid into the dorm, yanking open his desk drawer to get the earplugs. He put them in, hiding their evidence under his hair. As he ran back down all the flights of stairs he adjusted the sound levels until he got to what he hoped would work.Remus hated using his earplugs for a regular day like this—he didn't want to depend on them. But...He flung himself through the door to the Potions classroom just as nine am hit, and tripped, landing on his face. The Slytherins and some of the Gryffindors laughed and he could hear a few murmurings of the all too familiar phrase of Loopy Lupin."Are you all right, Mr. Lupin?" Slughorn asked, hurrying over to help Remus to his feet."Y-yes sir," he said, feeling blood pouring from his nose. He raised his arm, covering his nose with his sleeve, staring through his fringe at Slughorn. "Ahh...""Come into my office for a moment," Slughorn said, helping him through the doorway. "What happened?" he asked once the door was shut. He began rummaging through his cupboard. "Your friends were here five minutes ago.""I l-left something in my dorm," Remus said, glad his fall hadn't broken the earplugs! Thank Merlin he fell on his face and didn't strike the back of his head against the floor. He'd have to be very careful. "I thought I—thought—thought I had time." Slughorn handed him a potion that would heal his nose. "Um, s-sir? What—um, I don't need this?""Your nose is injured," Slughorn said.Remus squirmed uncomfortably. "I—I heal, s-sir?"Slughorn stared at him for the longest time before putting the vial back in his cupboard. "I assumed that was a rumor of—of your kind. Interesting." He then gave Remus a damp cloth to clean his face off and was watching him with an expression that made Remus feel beyond uneasy."Th-thank you, sir." Remus finished getting rid of the blood and Slughorn threw the handkerchief away. "S-sorry for the—sorry.""It's quite all right, you're usually never late. Though your tie is very crooked and I'm afraid I must take a point off for that."They returned to the classroom and Remus sat on the end of the bench next to Peter, trying to keep enough space so their arms didn't touch. Slughorn gave a lecture about some ingredients and the potion they'd be working on, and then announced it'd be solo potion work. Remus swore under his breath, rubbing his eyes as he tried to wake up a bit more. This was going to be an unmitigated disaster, especially since some of the ingredients smelled very strongly.It wasn't long before his potion was completely off-color and thicker than it should be. Remus peered into the bubbling goo wondering what he had done wrong! He double-checked the ingredients and then rubbed his head, feeling as though he might throw up. Carefully he read through the steps and realized he had added the zalthorn seeds too quickly. Okay, think, you know this, how to counteract the thickness? He stared at the text until it went blurry. His head was pounding, and he was sweating profusely due to all the potions boiling for so long. Several others had shed their robes and Remus followed suit. The seaweed powder should reduce the effect of the seeds... however it will just make the potion even thicker. Would the rosewater work...?He did some quick maths on a piece of paper before adding some rosewater and seaweed powder. The potion became the right thickness, however turned black. Remus swore, realizing too late the rosewater combined with the crushed hermit crab shells messed it up. After wiping the sweat from his forehead, he reluctantly raised his hand. When Slughorn approached, he explained what he did, and Slughorn looked at Remus's potion as if it were something dangerous."You were on the right track," Slughorn said slowly, "however you are right, the rosewater with the shells—you must have exact proportions when combining with zalthorn seeds in order to offset the reaction between the shells and the seeds, in addition to the rosewater combining dangerously with the bulbadox powder. I'm afraid you've made something... quite poisonous." He waved his wand, and the contents of the cauldron disappeared. "Wash it out and start again, you should have just enough time if you're quick."There were several titters as Remus scurried to the back to clean his cauldron out. He went as quickly as he could but wasn't fast enough and by the time class was over his potion still had a good ten minutes left. After giving him an A for effort, Slughorn asked for an essay about the ingredients, understanding the way they interact, and the importance of proper calculations for all ingredients involved in order to not make poison. It was embarrassing."How do you manage that?" James asked when they left the classroom. All of them had their robes over their arms, and James, Peter, and Remus had disastrously messy hair from all the heat and steam; Sirius's hair looked flawless. "You—you made poison.""I don't know!" he grumbled, trying to smooth his hair down. "It was smelly and my head hurts, it's—it's hard to focus!""You made poison," Peter said, sounding rather impressed."So—rosewater and bulbadox powder makes poison?" Sirius asked."Not directly," James replied. "It's... more of... the wrong amounts of ingredients mixed together. It was the rosewater, and bulbadox powder, and shells, and seeds, and probably everything else too." He paused to think and added, "Though bulbadox powder is dangerous. It can cause boils on its own.""Hmmmm... sounds like something we should use on someone," snickered Sirius."Oooh, putting bulbadox powder in someone's bed!" laughed James. "Perfect! Next time we go to Hogsmeade I'll have to get some."/\/\/\/\/\Remus moaned when James woke him up well before dawn. The rest of Friday hadn't gone so well, and he has spent as much time alone as possible which included skipping Study Group. He had also stayed up very late, distracting himself from the miserable thoughts by finishing off a book by his favorite author, Ariadne Quillers. By the time he had gone to sleep it was after one in the morning, and now it was four."Ugh..." He rubbed his aching head, reaching for his glass of water to help calm his stomach."You sure you're still wanting to do this?" James whispered."Yes... and the sooner we go the sooner I can get back to sleep..."He quietly slid out of bed, putting shoes and a dressing gown on. Peter was in his pajamas and a robe, but James and Sirius were dressed head to toe in black."You—you do realize we'll be under the invisibility cloak, right?" Remus asked.Sirius struck a pose. "And we'll look terrific under the cloak."They didn't get under the cloak until after they left the common room. It was crowded, and Remus was squashed up between James and Sirius. They shuffled along as quietly as they could, limbs knocking together. And breath being wafted across faces."Did you clean your teeth before bed?" Remus hissed at Sirius."If by eating half a box of pepper imps is cleaning them then sure," replied Sirius."No wonder you smell like smoke." Sirius let out a puff of breath right in Remus's face. "Ugh, no, don't! Ewww!""Would you two be quiet!" James snapped. "We're kinda sneaking through the school here."Sirius giggled a bit while Remus fell silent though purposely let his sharp elbow clip against Sirius's side. Sirius nudged him back. Remus elbowed harder and then Sirius poked him in the ribs, causing him to yelp and jump, knocking into James who snapped at them yet again. Sirius clamped a hand over his mouth to try to stop from giggling louder, while Remus apologized. Or tried to. Sirius poked him again, and Remus's apology turned into another squeaky yelp."Do I have to separate you two?" James teased, and Sirius had to stop walking completely as he fought against the laughter. Finally, though, they continued, and Remus tried not to bump against Sirius too much.They had to stop several times to avoid Peeves and, at one point, a teacher. No sign of Filch which was either a very bad sign (was he in his office?) or a very good sign (asleep). When they reached his office, James tapped at the door multiple times with no response. They exchanged looks then James unlocked the door."Nobody's in there," Remus whispered, and they went through the door."Whoa, it's so creepy!" Peter said, glancing anxiously at the manacles hanging on the wall."You've been in here multiple times," laughed Sirius, smacking Pete."Not in the dark!" Pete grumbled as James pulled the cloak off. "Can we turn a light on?"James snorted. "Sure! If we want someone to see the light."Remus's eyes darted around the room and reached for a pile of cleaning cloths. He lined them up on the floor along the crack. "That should be fine. Lumos. Oh! Nox." They were plunged back into darkness, and Peter asked if the rags weren't working. "I need to use my wand, for the spell," Remus pointed out. "Chionius!" He flicked his wand, and soon snow began falling from the ceiling."Er, right," Pete said. "Lumos. What are you two doing?"James and Sirius were rifling through the cabinet marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous. Sirius glanced over his shoulder and replied, "Nicking stuff.""Chionius," Remus repeated, reinforcing the spell."More like taking our stuff back, this is mine!" James pulled out a roll of firecrackers. "He took them from me the other day.""Yeah, this is yours too," said Sirius, pulling a box of stink pellets out, then a vial of Bubble Belch. "And this.""How is Bubble Belch highly dangerous?" Remus asked. "Chionius.""Guess it depends how loud the belch is," giggled Peter, and James grinned at him.Sirius took a dungbomb out of the drawer. "Jimsy, how much of this is yours?"James snorted. "Looks like a good seventy percent of it. Look, someone's got to help keep Filch employed—OH MERLIN!" James shrieked, then covered his mouth. "Shit, how loud was that?"Sirius was putting the stuff in his pockets. "Pretty loud. Merlin what?""Chionius."James slowly pulled a parcel out of the drawer. "Flaming. Ink."Sirius gasped. "Where did Filch—or rather, who did he get these off of? And where did they find them?""Who knows? Who cares!" James set it on the desk. "This is gonna be brilliant!"By the time their pockets were full there was a good inch of snow on everything. Remus put the spell on the ceiling again for good measure and it began snowing even harder. They disappeared under the cloak again and hurried back to the tower, trying not to laugh./\/\/\/\/\First thing in the morning (which was after ten am) James, Sirius, Peter, and Remus tried to casually go near Filch's office but it was all blocked off. By the time lunch rolled around on Saturday a new rule was posted: no making it snow in teachers' offices or staff rooms. The Marauders weren't quite sure how deep the snow wound up being in Filch's office—the rumors all varied. The least amount they heard was one foot, the most they heard was it went past the door and when Filch opened the door there was an avalanche on him."I don't understand what the big deal is. It's just snow, not like it's fire," yawned Sirius as they ate lunch, listening to the gossip around them. "Not like his office was ruined. We're not animals."I am, Remus thought, though kept his mouth shut."'Less the snow melted an' made a pool," Peter said.James's eyes lit up. "We should absolutely make a pool somewhere in the school sometime.""You can't just go around making holes in the school," Remus pointed out.Sirius grinned at him. "Someone did, with the pits."Remus closed his mouth, annoyed. "Er, right, well—we saw how dangerous that was...""Have you figured out anything new?" James asked."Not yet. I've been rather busy with everything else going on." He poked at his rice, realizing he had told Aegis about the book and not them. "The book we found had some pages ripped out of it which possibly may be connected.""What pages?"Remus frowned, suddenly unsure about sharing the theory about the Chamber of Secrets. It was such a farfetched possibility with the only linked evidence being the missing pages, which was not at all strong evidence. "Some pages about Slytherin," he finally said."Those are the pages I'd rip out too!" Sirius exclaimed, and the others all laughed.They began chattering while Remus stared into space, thinking about nicking a broom again with Aegis. Stealing school—borrowing school property wasn't the best of plans, however it wasn't as though they could get a broom from anywhere else. There was also the possibility of a ladder? A very, very, very long ladder. or a rope? Attached to something? Would he be able to climb a rope? He had the strength for it. Would Aegis? He could pull Aegis out of a pit except that would show off how strong he was.Hmmm. He rested his chin in his hand, absentmindedly stirring his rice as he tried to figure out a good way of getting in and out of those pits./\/\/\/\/\Remus spent some of the afternoon in the Pits Passage by himself. The others all had detention together, and initially Remus had intended to go to the library but halfway there he changed his mind. Soon he was crouched at the edge of the first pit, trying to see as far down in as he could. He eventually sat back and attempted a light-up spell on a bit of parchment until it started glowing, albeit faintly. Frowning, he prodded at it until it got a little brighter then he lobbed it down into the darkness. He watched it fall about a story then stop. Hmm, he thought, and slid along the narrow ledge of wood to the second pit to repeat the process. This one was a bit deeper.Soon he began pacing, still trying to figure out a good way to get in and out of them. One idea formed in his head... however it was incredibly stupid and certainly unsafe. Probably dangerous. Possibly the worst idea he had ever had in his life, barring whatever he had done to get bitten.Remus chewed at his nails, wondering if Aegis would go for it. Only one way to find out.It took him a while to find his friend. First, he checked the other end of the Pits Passage, then the library, the Great Hall, various nooks and crannies, and finally went to the dungeons and hovered outside the Slytherin common room. He intended to ask the first Slytherin he saw to see if Aegis was in there, however the first Slytherin he saw was a very angry looking fifth or sixth year who looked like he wanted to murder Remus for daring to be in the vicinity. Then a troop of fourth years left the common room, all of them shooting Remus odd looks. Then Remus ducked into a side corridor when he saw Malfoy and his goons heading to the common room.Darn it all, he thought, about to give up on finding Aegis when he saw a Slytherin that might help him.Regulus jumped about fifty feet when Remus popped out from the corridor. "Ahh, s-sorry!" Remus said as Regulus clutched his chest."Why did you do that?!" Regulus demanded, not sounding at all like his usual self. Whenever Remus normally heard him he sort of sounded thin and anxious, like he needed to be careful about the words that came out. Now he sounded irritated and not at all worried about how he came across."Sorry," Remus repeated."Did my brother put you up to that?" he asked, face clouding."N-no! I—I n-needed to t-talk to Aegis Silverlocke," Remus explained.Regulus gave him a strange look. "Why?""I, er, it's—it's important. An—an emergency.""What sort of emergency?"Remus racked his brains. "Um. About... an—an essay."One eyebrow lifted, and Regulus folded his arms. "An emergency essay?" he asked, then snorted as he shook his head. "My brother was right about you."What? Remus wondered."I suppose you want me to go get him?" Regulus continued."Er, I mean—I—if you—if you d-don't mind?" Remus whispered, twisting the hem of his jumper around one finger as he looked up at Regulus. He was only a first year but already a few inches taller than Remus. Perhaps his birthday was right at the beginning of September and he was twelve already? That would make Remus feel slightly less bad about his height.Regulus studied Remus carefully, a sort of haughty expression on his face that looked so much like Sirius that it sent an uncomfortable shiver down Remus's spine. "I can't be seen talking to him," Regulus finally said."Oh." Remus fought off the urge to snap at him, to tell him he was being rude and awful if he was shunning Aegis for whatever reason."But..." Regulus tipped his head. "I will.""You—will?""If you do me a favor."Remus started to say yes then quickly shut his mouth. "What sort of—of f-favor?"Regulus glanced down the corridor then took Remus's arm, pulling him back into the side corridor. "You're the smartest kid in school, right?" he asked quietly."Um—no, but—""I'm having some trouble with some of my assignments," Regulus continued, ignoring Remus's protests. "Would you help me?"Remus was rather taken aback by this quest, definitely not expecting it. Regulus shifted from foot to foot, rubbing his elbow as he purposely avoided Remus's stare. "Y—yeah. I can—I can help.""Very well. I'll be right back." Regulus spun around and went into the Slytherin common room. Remus waited where he was, watching the wall, hoping Aegis was in there. Even if he wasn't he'd help Regulus.About four or five minutes passed and the wall opened again, Regulus appearing again followed by Aegis. Aegis had a frown on his face and when he spotted Remus he was obviously surprised."There," Regulus said, folding his arms again. "Tomorrow at one in the library? Oh, and don't tell Sirius.""Oh! Ah, y-yes," Remus said, a bit startled by the request to not let Sirius know. Regulus shrugged and went back to the common room."Tomorrow?" Aegis asked curiously."Um, nothing," Remus muttered. "I think I might have figured out a—a way to get..." He stopped, realizing they were probably too close to the common room. He motioned for Aegis to follow him and took him down to a secret corridor. "I have an idea to get into the pits without stealing a broom."Aegis widened his eyes. "You have?""Um, yeah, it's... uh..." Remus tugged at his sleeve, feeling awkward now. "It could be dangerous though.""More dangerous than one of the school brooms?" Aegis joked, and Remus smiled."Hmm, you do have a point," he conceded before telling Aegis the idea. Aegis stared blankly at Remus until he finished then he stepped back, very shocked. "What do you think?" Remus asked."I think Misters Black and Potter have rubbed off on you," replied Aegis. "That has got to be the most mental idea I have ever heard in my life.""Should we make a ladder? I think they'd be too short. Or—or use rope?"He flinched at those suggestions. "Ahhh... those seem potentially more dangerous or rather, the ladder seems preposterous. If we enchant it to be longer it could weaken.""That's what I thought. Rope...""Could you use the levitation spell on the rope to pull yourself and/or me up?" Aegis inquired.Remus wrinkled his nose. "I don't know if I could levitate either of us. I could try but I think that mass might be a bit much for me. Let me try.""Wait—"He got his wand out and flourished it at Aegis's jumper. "Wingardium leviosa.""Re—wait!" Aegis yelped. The jumper jerked up a little, pulling Aegis with it; he got about an inch or two off the ground when the jumper yanked itself off, and Aegis fell.Remus clapped a hand over his mouth. "I'm so sorry!"Aegis was on the ground, laughing. "It's Jarleth Hobart all over again!" he said, and Remus began laughing too. "Thank Merlin it was only my jumper you enchanted."Remus offered his hand, pulling Aegis to his feet. "I am sorry, I wasn't thinking—""So it would seem," Aegis said, grinning. Remus retrieved the jumper and Aegis pulled it back on. "Well. You are strong however I am not sure if you could pull my weight up the entirety of one of the pits. I... suppose... your idea is... crazy but... better than stealing a broom. I am assuming you have access?""Yeah, um—yeah. I can go get them now."Aegis frowned. "Unfortunately I cannot do it today. I am rather behind in homework. Next Saturday?""That will work," Remus lied. Next Saturday he'd be 'visiting his sick mother', so they'd have to wait two weeks. While he didn't want to wait that long, he also knew homework was far more important. Unless they managed to find some time during the week. "Do you need any help?""No thank you. It's only a matter of making myself sit down and do it," sighed Aegis, taking his hair out of the messy ponytail and pulling it back into a nicer one.They talked for a few more minutes before Aegis returned to the common room and Remus headed off, not sure what to do. After wandering around for a while, he went to the library to work on some assignments though everything was pretty much done. He rewrote an essay and had just started on another when the other Marauders showed up, finished with detention and smelling very strongly of cleaning supplies. Apparently they had to clean out Filch's office."S'not fair!" James complained as they walked through the corridors. "We weren't caught for that. We just happened to have detention today and Filch... ooh he's such a twat!""Filch definitely blamed us," Sirius informed Remus. "He kept hovering around and telling us how we liked cleaning up after our own messes.""It was like a swamp," giggled Peter. "Everything was soaked. We had to dry things out.""Some of the old detention folders were wet too and we had to rewrite them," sighed James, flexing his hand and fingers."It's a good thing you weren't there," added Sirius, elbowing Remus. "The cat's litter box was soaked and made the whole place smell disgusting."James adjusted his glasses, casting a smirk at Sirius. "Hopefully he doesn't torture you too much tomorrow.""You have detention tomorrow?" Remus asked. "Since when?""Since I told Filch he wouldn't've had a problem with soggy detention slips if he waterproofed his cabinets," Sirius answered."I think it might have also been the fact you hinted it was his personality that made everything soggy and gross," Peter pointed.Sirius smiled very sweetly. "Am I wrong? He's a soggy scone. A waterlogged scone mushed up into a soggy lump of disgusting.""EW!" Peter screeched. "That is gross, Sirius! You've put me right off scones now.""That was a very disturbing description," James agreed.Sirius snorted, waving his hand dismissively. "Either way, it's true. Waterproof the cabinets. What's so hard about that?""It's typically a bad idea to insult the staff," Remus said.Sirius flung his arm across Remus's shoulder. "I didn't call him a soggy scone to his face, as tempting as it is; I only vaguely hinted. Now then, what trouble shall we get into?""Personally, I think you three should get into a shower," Remus said, ducking away from Sirius's arm. Mostly due to the stench, but also because it was upsetting the box. "You stink."

Author's note: I wanted to say I'll be getting an extra chapter out this week on Sunday, because I am super excited to see reactions to chapter 97 and I don't want to wait clear till next Friday haha!/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Sometime during Saturday evening it began snowing, which turned into a rather heavy blizzard. James watched out the window for a while then gave a miserable sigh, saying they'd have to wait till another to go listen in to the haunted house. Remus thanked his lucky stars it'd be put off for at least two weeks, since he was certain he could convince them not to go without him—or, hoped he could convince them. Otherwise, if they tried the next weekend he'd be there and they'd hear his real howls! Still, it was a relief and he felt a thousand times better.Which was a good thing, since that meant when he woke up Sunday morning he wasn't completely freaked out or overly anxious, meaning it would be easier to help Regulus. Remus felt a little awkward keeping the fact he was going to help Regulus from Sirius. He wasn't sure why Regulus didn't want Sirius to know, but he'd keep quiet. As best he could.After James's practice and a long lunch on Sunday, Remus said goodbye to the other Marauders to go to the library, arriving there five minutes before one. He stayed near the front since he wasn't sure where Regulus wanted to sit, but when one o'clock hit he wondered if Reg was actually somewhere in the library.Two seconds later Regulus strode through the doors, books clutched to his chest as he glanced nervously around. When he spotted Remus, he seemed a little relieved. "I wasn't sure if you'd be here.""Wh—why w-wouldn't I?" Remus asked as they walked farther into the library, going to a back table. "I s-said I w-would help."Regulus gave a shrug. "I'm not really used to Gryffindors being trustworthy when it comes to Slytherins.""I... I c-can underst—stand that," Remus muttered as they took over a small table. "What c-classes are you h-having t-trouble in?""Transfiguration, mostly," he said, setting his books down. "Charms. Some... Defense Against the Dark Arts.""Are you h-having trouble w—with the homework or—or in-class work?" Remus found it was actually not so difficult to talk to Regulus. Normally he'd be stuttering worse, chatting with someone he barely knew, but Regulus looked so similar to Sirius (especially in their casual clothes) it didn't seem so troubling, or quite as anxiety-inducing as it was talking to other strangers.Regulus traced the design on the front of his Charms book, not answering."Well, why—why don't we st-start with the one you're having m-most trouble in," Remus suggested.When Regulus glanced up Remus realized how strange it was, seeing brown eyes instead of silver ones; plus Regulus's eyes were shaped a bit differently. They were lower… sleepier. "You didn't tell Sirius, did you?""Ah? N—no, I didn't," Remus promised. Regulus kept frowning, staring intently at Remus as if trying to decide whether he was telling the truth or not. "I w-won't," he added. "I told him th-that I was g-going to st—study in the l-library. I didn't say I w-would be with anyone.""Does he ever come in here to get you?"Remus considered answering, and instead asked, "Why are we t-talking about S-Sirius instead of—of schoolwork?""Does he?" Regulus pressed.Remus sighed. "Somet-times.""So he may come in to get you?""If you d-d-don't want my help—""I do." Regulus sat upright, forehead wrinkled. "I don't want him to know. If he might show up we should go elsewhere."This was getting a little tiring, and Remus said, probably a little harsher than he should, "I d-don't really care that you d-don't want him to know but—but if all you're going to do is m-make sure I haven't t-told him it's a waste of both our time."They stared at one another for several seconds, then Regulus's shoulders relaxed a little. "I didn't mean to waste time. I only want to make sure he doesn't show up." Remus got up, grabbing his books and Regulus stood as well. "I said I didn't mean—"Remus gave him a look. "I assumed you'd w-want to go elsewh—where?""Oh. Right. Yes."Regulus got his stuff, following Remus out of the library. They went down a few corridors until Remus found an unused classroom. He unlocked the door and went in."It looks as though that's something you've done a lot, going into places you shouldn't," Regulus remarked as he strode into the dark room.Remus locked the door behind him before opening the shutters, letting light in. He lit the few candles sitting around to help, then set his satchel on the ground next to one of the desks lined against the wall. "It's a c-common occurrence with my frie—friends, yes.""Judging by the amount of detention Sirius gets into, that doesn't surprise me."Suddenly Remus felt incredibly weird standing in a room with someone he hardly knew, but who knew one of his best friends more than he probably ever would. Remus and Sirius had about fifteen months since they became friends; Sirius and Regulus had known each other around eleven, twelve years."R—right. Now. What's g-giving you difficulty?" Remus asked."I said Transfiguration, Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts," replied Regulus in an irritated tone. "Didn't you listen?"Remus took in a deep breath. Was being a brat a Black trait or did the brothers just happen to get an extra helping when they were born? "What p-p-part of them?" he asked as calmly as he could. "Mammalian transfiguration or amphibious? Maths? In Charms are you having difficulties making objects move, or creating illusions? Spell pronunciation, etymology, and memorization? Theoretical work? Proper gesticulation of the wand? Which aspect?"Regulus stared in bewilderment as Remus spoke, and he sorta regretted letting his temper get the better of him. Regulus wasn't Sirius; smart-mouthing back wasn't the best of courses. He'd really need to watch that."It w-w-will help if I h-have a foundation on wh—which to begin to h—help you," he added, gently."W... wand work," Regulus muttered. "It never goes well.""I see. It's Febu—February so you sh-should be beginning to work on—on... oh! I know." Remus got a piece of parchment out of his bag and ripped them into strips to transfigure into worms. "You sh-should know how to t-turn them into st—sticks by this point, you l-learned last month, right?"Regulus gave the worms a frown. "Yes... ah, er, right." He pulled his wand out and approached the worms. He held his wand a little strangely while doing the movement. "Sticcafors!""You—the movement is—is a little off," Remus said, showing off the proper flourish. "Like th-that.""Right. Sticcafors!" While the movement was still a little off, one of the worms turned dark brown. No matter how hard Regulus tried, the worm would not become a stick. The best he could manage was the color and making the worm slightly stiff."Your—your movements are r-really loose and a-a little w-wobbly," Remus said, chewing his lip as he tried to figure out a way to tighten up Regulus's form."I'm aware," Regulus snapped.Remus just smiled. "Do this," he said and held his right wrist with his left hand. "D-don't move your arm, k-keep your elbow in c-close to your s-s-side. Like this."Regulus watched him then turned back to the worms. He had to remove his watch then he held his wrist; the movement was a lot tighter and pretty much close to exact, however the worm still was quite... wormy. After a few more attempts Remus turned them all into sticks for Regulus to try to levitate them. Again, his movements were wide and wobbly. Remus had him do the wrist-holding thing which helped some, but despite the movements being right and the pronunciation correct, the sticks barely lifted. They went through a variety of spells, and several long discussions about the spells to see if Regulus just needed a more thorough knowledge of the spell, history, and etymology. But that didn't seem to help either.Remus stood back with his arms folded, very perplexed. "Is it... all your spells th-that don't w-work correctly?" he asked and Regulus scowled. "No, I m-mean... how's your th-theoretical work? Your tests and—and essays? Wh—what about other classes? Herbology and—and those ones?""My homework comes back highly graded," Regulus said, rubbing his right wrist uncomfortably. "My written tests do too. It's the... practical side of spellwork that doesn't seem to work right. I do well in the other classes, especially Potions. Not History, though, I have some trouble there. The... creature side of Defense Against the Dark Arts I do very well in too." He looked down at his wand a little sadly. "Holding my wrist seems to help some.""Is... is y-your wand a hand-me-down?" Remus inquired.He had almost gotten one of those. His father had considered giving him his old school wand, but when he had put it in Remus's hand everything went disastrous. The singe in the carpet was still noticeable, and Remus had suffered heavy burns that took a little while to heal. When they had gone to Ollivander's for some input, Mr. Ollivander had practically winced. He explained used wands could be all right however some combinations did not go well with the user. Lyall's wand was from France so Ollivander wasn't sure what was in it, since he hadn't made it. When he questioned Lyall about it, Lyall got all shifty and said he couldn't remember. They wound up buying Remus a brand new wand. Later, at home, Lyall admitted to Remus the core of his old wand was hair of a werewolf. At first Remus was surprised. After all, shouldn't that mean the wand would suit him well? Then he realized perhaps it was like trying to push together the same side of magnets, and the wand was simply repelling against Remus.However, Regulus shook his head. "No, we bought it in July," he said, shifting his wand to his left hand. "Brand new.""Hmm. Well, per—perhaps you d-don't have a natural knack for... sp-spells," Remus said, voice trailing thinner as he spoke since it wasn't a very nice thing to say.Regulus's face went a little dark, but he nodded. "Perhaps. I... appreciate the attempt at helping.""I'll keep thinking about it, m—maybe I'll figure it out. You s-said you have trouble with History? Do you—you need help with that?""What, you can help me memorize dusty old dates and boring facts?" snorted Regulus, obviously not believing such a thing was possible."I might be able t-to," Remus answered, knowing perfectly well History could be interesting... just not the way Binns taught it. "Can't hurt to—to try.""I suppose... perhaps... next Sunday? It is getting late.""Is it?" Remus asked, startled. Regulus held up his watch, letting it dangle for Remus to see it was almost three. They had been working together for almost two hours! "Oh! When—when did that happen?""No idea," Regulus said, putting his watch back on. "I'm exhausted though.""You've been w-working for t-two hours, it's underst—standable," Remus said, rubbing his temples. "I sh-should have ended this an a hour ago, I'm s-sorry. You w-want to get together next Sunday and—and try to w-work on History?""If you don't mind... I know you only agreed to one session..."Remus shrugged. "I don't m-mind helping." One of the reasons he liked Study Group was him being able to be useful; helping Macdonald fell in that category, and helping Regulus would too."Hmm." Regulus gathered his stuff. "In this classroom at one, next Sunday?""Yes." Remus felt bad for lying again, wishing he didn't have to keep making plans for the full moon without being able to follow through."Right. Until then." Regulus left the room.Remus blew out the candles, closed the shutters, and left the room as well, working on a lie to tell Sirius in case Sirius had gone to the library. He still wasn't quite sure why Regulus was so adamant against Sirius knowing, but he'd do his best to make sure Sirius wouldn't find out./\/\/\/\/\Sirius hadn't gone to the library when Remus was with Regulus, nor did he seem too interested in where Remus had been, so for the moment it seemed as though the secret could be kept. However, if Remus and Regulus started meeting up for tutoring they may run into the issue down the line of Sirius discovering them.Sunday evening was spent practicing the heart bubble spell again, and on Monday morning they woke up early to do a practice run. They wanted to be there early, but not too early. Once they reached the Great Hall they immediately ran into the problem of getting the yarn or string or whatever Fawley would give them around the entire door. Actually, reaching the top of the door would prove to be difficult."I could carry Remus on my shoulders," Sirius suggested."Sirius, you're tall but not that tall," said Remus, studying the huge entrance."Well, how are we gonna get it up there?" James demanded.Remus shrugged. "Your broom."James slapped his forehead. "Of course.""Can't really do a run of it today then," Peter said."No, but we can get an idea of when students start showing up," said James.They waited down the hall, growing tired and bored as they waited. Students started showing up at around seven, seven-fifteen; the food didn't start appearing on the tables till seven-thirty. The four of them headed back to their dorms though they couldn't really get much of a nap. Remus did lay down for another half hour before heading down to breakfast with his friends./\/\/\/\/\The following morning they woke up early again, this time taking James's broom. Once at the entrance there was a lot of debate about who could remain under the cloak. Finally Sirius, Peter, and Remus hid out nearby while James, under the cloak, put yarn around the door. He had to do a sticking spell to get it to stay, then removed it. Once on the ground, he fetched his friends and they stuck their hands out of the cloak to pretend to do spells. It took a couple of minutes, but shouldn't be too difficult. Providing the string-yarn-ribbon-whatever Fawley gave them worked... it was going to be absolutely brilliant!All four of them were quite tired after waking up early for the second day in a row—and they'd be waking up early the next day, too. Remus realized since Valentine's day was on Wednesday... that was a morning the Marauders usually weren't at breakfast. Would it be too suspicious if they were, to see the results? Should they wait till their normal time? Would people still have the heart bubbles by lunch or would someone have figured out how to get rid of them by that point?Remus brought this up and they agreed it was something they'd have to think over."Jimmy and I could hide under the cloak for a bit," Sirius said. "It might not be so weird if you two show up for breakfast a bit early, perhaps?"It wouldn't be as suspicious than if all four were there, and Remus and Pete were the more 'innocent' ones. Sometimes Remus wondered when the teachers would wise up on who was giving James and Sirius all the spells. Did they think the two of them did all the research on their own? One day they'd realize, and then Remus would be in a lot of trouble. Honestly, he was surprised (and glad) it hadn't happened yet.The school was definitely preparing for Valentine's day. The special dessert had been announced the other day and it was as annoying as the previous year: lots of giggling girls and strutting guys. James and Remus were pretty annoyed by Tuesday, but Peter bemoaned the fact he wanted to take someone, and Sirius was quiet about the entire affair until lunch on Tuesday when, after James made a comment about perhaps they should prank the dessert too, that he was going."What? Since when?" James demanded, shocked.Sirius tore bits of crust off his sandwich. "I asked Cassie last night," he mumbled, not looking at his friends."Traitor!" James moaned out, but gave Sirius a whack on the back. "Good luck, mate. Going to... you know...?" He wriggled his eyebrows.Sirius grinned. "I might. If she wants to.""Might what?" Pete asked miserably."Kiss her," Sirius replied in a very casual manner.Peter dropped his fork. "You what? You will?"James and Sirius exchanged looks. "Er... well... honestly..." Sirius rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. "We did before. Already. Once."'WHAT?!" Peter shrieked so loudly that several people looked their way. "When?! Where? How?""Probably with their lips," James said, and began giggling."New Years," Sirius said, puffing his chest out. "At midnight."Peter stared wide-eyed at Sirius. "Wow! What was it like?""Pretty amazing.""How come you didn't tell us?""I dunno. I told James." Sirius went back to his torn up sandwich. "I told you now." He shredded the sandwich into smaller bits. "You're being awfully quiet, Remy."Remus was focused very intently on his food, trying his best to ignore the conversation going on around him and failing. "What?" he asked, pretending as though he hadn't heard every single word. "Sorry, I was thinking about our test on Thursday.""What test?" James asked.Remus gave him an exasperated stare. "Our test? In Herbology? That Sprout talked about this morning, and last Thursday?"James messed up his hair. "Ooh right, that test.""You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?""In all honesty, I was a bit busy putting worms in Evans's bag when Sprout was yammering on," James admitted. "What test?""Sirius kissed Cassie," Peter said helpfully.Remus stiffened a little, not sure whether to reveal he had heard the conversation on New Years or not. He really needed to tell them he could hear through the curtains. Would Sirius get mad if he said he already knew? He glanced at Sirius who looked rather awkward and slightly embarrassed. "Oh?" Remus finally squeaked out, trying to sound like he didn't already know."On New Years," Sirius muttered, trying to shred his sandwich some more but failing since it was pretty much crumbs at that point."Congratulations," Remus said, hoping he sounded somewhat sincere. "The test is mostly revision work, so as long as you've been paying attention in class you should be fine."James snapped his fingers. "Blast it all. Remus, could you—""We can go over things tonight or tomorrow night if you like," Remus promised, trying now to ignore the fact Sirius was staring at him."You should take Evans," Sirius said.Remus frowned. "To the test?""Bloody hell, Brains, yes to the test," Sirius grumbled. "No! To the dessert thing.""I don't—""And one of you can take Colgate," Sirius continued, ignoring Remus. "And we can find a fourth for the remaining Marauder."Peter began to talk but James cut him off with, "Pete can take Colgate, I'm not interested in going.""Neither am I," Remus said."It'll be so fun though," Sirius argued. "All of us going."Remus clenched his teeth. "I don't want to.""I'm sure Evans—""For the millionth time, Lily and I are not interested in one another!" Remus snapped, his temper flaring. The wolf stirred a bit, and he curled his fingers into fists. "We're friends. Nothing more." The memory of their two kisses was strong, and he could practically feel her lips on his. He could feel heat flooding his face, which didn't make the situation any better."Who are you interested in, then?" Sirius asked, his gaze piercing Remus's soul.Remus swallowed, gripping his fork to try not to let his hands shake so much. "Nobody, at the moment," he said, struggling to keep his voice neutral. It was true. He wasn't interested in anyone. Not yet. "But when I do, it won't be one of my best friends." For some reason that made his chest hurt, and he wanted this conversation to be over with.James flung an arm around Remus. "Remy and I can nick desserts from the kitchen and have our own celebration.""Th-that sounds g-good to me," Remus said, knowing he sounded relieved.Sirius didn't seem very impressed by all this. "Right, well... I guess we should work on getting a girl for Pete then.""Good luck with that," Peter grumbled. Sirius studied him for a second then got up, going over to where Lily sat with Inkwood and Colgate. Peter went pale. "Wh—what is he doing?!""Looks like he's getting you someone to have dessert with," replied James, snickering.Peter's face was etched with horror, and when the girls looked his way he sank completely under the table. "Merlin's bloody toe, kill me now!" he whimpered out from Remus's feet.A moment later Sirius returned, tilting his head to peer under the table. "Colgate says she'll go, as long as it's only as friends."Peter's eyes were big and round as he peered over the edge of the table. "R-really?""Yup! Congrats!" Sirius elbowed him before noticing his destroyed food. "Oops. So, Jimsy, Remy, you're certain?""Yes," they chorused."Hmm. Well. If you're sure." Sirius gave Remus a rather odd look, but thank Merlin the stupid dessert thing was finally dropped, and Remus was able to finish his lunch in peace, albeit with a stomachache./\/\/\/\/\"Do you want to go to the dessert thing tomorrow?" Lily asked as she and Remus walked to Defense together.Remus dropped his bag, books spilling out. "What? W—with you?""Or someone," she said, watching him gather his books up. "I could say... I know someone who wants to go with you.""Me?""She's been hoping you'd ask her, but she's too shy to ask you herself," Lily continued as they started walking again. Remus groaned, clutching his stomach. "What's wrong?""It's all Sirius could talk about at lunch," he grumbled. "It was annoying.""Ali's going with Pete...""I know," he sighed. "Sirius tried to get me to ask you, and said we could find a fourth for James."Lily thought about this for a few seconds. "If Potter takes Ali, I could go with Pete, and I could get a fourth for you. The girl I mentioned. Stop shaking your head! D'you have any idea who I'm talking about?""No," he said, "but it doesn't matter. I don't want to go."Now it was Lily's turn to sigh. "Fine. Hmph. Well, in any case I want to go."Remus hesitated. "You d-don't want me to take you, do you?""Oh, goodness no! That would be awful for—er, the girl I mentioned!" Lily sounded horrified at the very thought. "I couldn't do that to her. That'd be terrible."Remus didn't say anything about that, confused about the whole thing but he was the last person in the school to understand human thing. It wasn't really his territory: feelings, and stuff like that."Remus, do you have any idea about who I'm talking about?" she asked, breaking the silence.He thought about all the girls he knew, and shook his head. "No. I haven't the faintest," he replied honestly, and she gave a sigh. "Who is it?""Oh, I can't tell you! That'd be a terrible thing to do too!"Then why did you bring it up? he wondered. Instead he asked, "Who are you going to go with, then?"Lily tucked some hair behind her ear. "Ooh, I'm not sure. I'll figure it out. Is the girl you've got a crush on going with someone else?""Huh?" Lily raised her eyebrows, and Remus flushed slightly. "I t-t-told you I didn't—I don't. I'm not interested in anyone.""Hmm. All right, then. Well... if you change your mind please let me know, all right?""Um... o—okay," he mumbled. "I won't. But if for some reason I'm possessed by some creature who wants to go I'll let you know."He wasn't sure if that was going too far, if it was too close to something he shouldn't be saying but Lily let out a light laugh. "Honestly. I thought you liked chocolate.""Not at that price," he replied without thinking, and then gave a nervous laugh to try to make it seem like a joke, praying it would sound like one. Lily rolled her eyes at him, but smiled and gave him a gentle arm bump."All right, you win. I won't bug you about it again." But during the rest of the walk to Defense she had a really strange expression on her face that made him a little panicky.

Author's note: sorry this is like 12 hours earlier than I normally post, having a sudden mental health issue and I doubt I'll be able to get the chapter out before work 'tomorrow' which is when I was planning on it./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\Peter was a nervous wreck as they headed to Occlumency. He kept wringing his hands and mumbling under his breath, no matter how many times Remus promised it would be all right. Peter asked multiple times what Fawley wanted with him, and Remus replied he wasn't entirely sure but Fawley was liking the other Marauders a lot more than she used to, so it couldn't be too bad."Hello Remus, Peter," Fawley said when they went through the door."Urp," Peter gulped."Hello Miss Fawley," Remus said."I brought the bit for your prank," she said, pulling a ball of very thin ribbon out from her purse. "It should cover the Great Hall entrance. Be careful, once you put some spells on there, that's it."The ribbon was glowing very faintly blue. Underneath the blue it seemed to be a sort of browny-grey color that would match the stone around the entrance. "Thank you so much." Remus tucked it in his robes pocket, feeling very excited. "I can't wait to show you next week.""I can't wait," she laughed. "Have a seat, both of you. Peter, I wanted to talk to you a little bit.""Um. R—right, yeah, um, yeah," he squeaked. "I don't—I'm—it's, uh—"Fawley reached out, resting a hand on his arm. "Relax. I'm not going to hurt you, or interrogate you. I only wanted to ask you a few questions.""L—like you did before?" he asked, still shaking a bit."Yes. This is more along the lines of what to expect from Occlumency," she explained. "Do you know much about it?""Um, no Miss, I—not really. Remus, um, he's said some things. It hurts, right?""A little bit," she said. "Remus can better explain, it's been a while since I've experienced it myself.""Headaches," he told Peter. "And sometimes this stabbing pain behind my eyes."Fawley went on to tell Peter what else to expect. How difficult it was, how he shouldn't expect to make much progress for a while, that he would have to practice a lot emptying himself. Remus watched Peter's face, pleased that Peter was taking everything in very determinedly. He had a crease between his eyebrows and he kept nodding. Fawley finished with asking him if he'd like to experience it."Ummmmmmm. Yeah, uh, yeah sure. You won't... ummm..." Peter shot to his feet, grabbing Remus's hand. "H—hold on, Miss Fawley." With that he dragged Remus out of the room, practically shoving him against the opposite wall. "What if she sees me on the loo?!" he hissed out into Remus's ear.Remus covered his mouth, trying not to laugh. "She won't stay in the memory if it's anything personal," he said. "There have rarely been any instances where she saw a memory of me going to the bathroom or taking a shower or anything like that. It... has happened, but she's never seen anything... personal, if you know what I mean.""Your... you know," Peter said, wide-eyed. He then mouthed the word 'penis'.Remus paused since yes, Fawley had seen that in memories of waking up after a full moon. "Well...""She has?!"Remus quickly shook his head, grabbing Pete's arms. "Not like that, no. It was because it was... something involving... my... you know..." He glanced around then made a face. "As James likes to put it...""Your furry little problem?""Ugh. Yes. It involved that.""Ooh.""Other than... that... no, she's never seen anything personal."Peter slowly nodded. "A—all right. Sorry if that seemed stupid I just got kinda worried. I don't want... um, yeah."Remus pat Peter's shoulder. "It's fine, I understand. It wasn't stupid at all, it's a legitimate concern."They returned to the room and sat on the couch, Peter next to Fawley. She told him what to expect, then put her fingers lightly on his temples. Remus watched eagerly since he hadn't really seen it done. The time with Sirius didn't count, since he had kicked her out without even trying. Oh, what if Pete's a natural too? he wondered, suddenly anxious. What if all his friends were?But Peter sat there slightly slack-jawed while Fawley frowned, both of them frozen in place. After nearly a full minute they pulled apart, Peter whimpering and rubbing his head, Fawley putting her hands in her lap.Finally Pete spoke. "That was so weird! Remy, you didn't say how weird it is! It was so... clear. Like I was watching the telly. 'Cept it was my own memory.""Are you all right?" Fawley asked."Uh-huh. Just a little weird. No headache though...""The headache is from fighting it," Remus said."All I do is... pretend my head is empty?" Peter went on.Fawley nodded. "It's different for everyone. When I learned, it worked best for me to imagine my head was an empty room with white walls.""I like to try to think of my brain as an empty book," Remus said. "I turn the pages and nothing is on them.""What works for us might not work for you," Fawley added. "Sometimes it might take a while for you to find something that clicks.""Okay. Um—when do we—I mean, when are we going to uhhh, um...""Begin your lessons?" Fawley asked. "I'm still not sure about that. Perhaps not until next year. It will be difficult to arrange things without Albus knowing why I am here for either an extra day of the week, or giving Remus longer sessions. In addition, we'll need to work around your club meetings, and James's practices."Remus shifted a little, trying not to think about the pressure they were putting on Fawley with keeping this a secret from Dumbledore. He hoped it wasn't too bad... and also still wasn't sure about the payment.Fawley and Peter talked for a few more minutes before Peter left so Remus could work on his Occlumency. It went about as normal as it usually did—him putting up a wimpy barrier—and by the end his head was hurting some. Once they were finished, Fawley asked if he had any idea when would be a good time to meet with James. Remus wasn't really sure, but Fawley asked if perhaps sometime if she showed up for their lesson early if he and James wouldn't mind coming in at 5:30, since his practice didn't start till 6."I'll talk to him," Remus promised. "Um... th—thank you. For being willing to—to help them... I know it's a lot and—""It's all right," she said, patting his arm. "I'm not sure how their lessons will go however it is encouraging that they are willing to try to keep you safe.""Th-they're really amazing friends," Remus said quietly, more to himself."I'm glad you have them."Remus smiled. "Me too. I don't know how I ever got so lucky. I—I'll see you next week, Miss Fawley. Thank you for the ribbon."He left the room, startled to find Peter waiting for him across the hall. Pete said he didn't feel like going outside by himself in the dark to the Quidditch pitch, and he hadn't wanted to go to the common room either. The two of them walked together, Peter asked questions about Occlumency and emptying the mind. He said he wasn't sure how well he'd do, since he wasn't good at much. Remus told him he was sure he'd do fine, and that Peter was good at plenty of things."I, um, have another question," Pete said when they ducked into a hallway that led to a back stairwell. "It's really... uhh... probably really personal so, um, I can understand if you don't wanna answer it." Peter tugged at the strap of his satchel, looking rather nervous. "Earlier you said she's seen you... um... you know, and you said it was cause of—of, um, that, and I just wasn't sure... what that meant? I mean, that it had to do with... that?"Remus's head was throbbing, and it was difficult to follow along Pete's train of thought. "I'm not sure I understand the question, I'm sorry.""Well. You said she's seen you without—you know... naked. That it had to do with your... month thing. And I wasn't sure why. It kinda confused me.""Oh." Remus took in a sharp breath, an uncomfortable feeling trickling down his spine. It probably would be okay to say he didn't want to talk about it, he figured Peter would understand, but at the same time it felt a little... nice that Peter was asking a question related to lycanthropy and sounding curious instead of scared. Even if it had to do with Miss Fawley seeing him in the nude. "When..." He stopped both speaking and walking, tilting his head to listen, making sure nobody was around. Once satisfied they were alone he began speaking again. "When I transform, if I'm wearing clothes they get—ah, erm, torn up. So I... don't. I mean, I undress before—before sunset. So I don't ruin my clothes."Peter frowned, and for a second Remus was worried Pete would think that was weird or creepy or stupid. "That sucks," he finally said. "That means when you're stuck as a person all night long you're starkers?"While it was a little uncomfortable to be discussing the fact he was naked, he didn't mind answering Peter's question. "Yes.""Damn! No wonder you get so cold!" Peter sounded very worried. "I'll see if my mum can make another blanket—""No, no, it's all right!" Remus said quickly. "I have a fire going in the winter, and the blanket you gave me helps loads.""I'm glad it helps." Peter didn't sound very glad though, he sounded rather miserable. When Remus pointed this out, he winced a little. "No, I am glad, I really am. It just makes me mad.""What does? That the blanket helps?""No!" he whined. "That—that we can't do more. Sirius says..." Peter trailed off, biting his bottom lip and looking very guilty.Remus stopped walking again, the hair on the back of his neck rising a little. "Sirius says what?""Oh, you know him, he's got a big mouth," Pete said with a very fake chuckle. Remus folded his arms, glaring until Peter broke down. "He says that—oh, he says that there must be something more we can do for you and he's not gonna stop till he figures it out. That there has'ta be a way to make it easier for you during the... you know, the moon time. That he'll find something."Remus stood still, anger curling its way through his body. He had doubted Sirius and James wouldn't rest about trying to figure something out, however he hadn't expected this much determination. It was frustrating, especially since Remus had made it clear there was nothing that could be done.Peter was watching him with a wrinkled forehead, visibly distressed. Remus took in a few deep breaths to try to calm himself down. Taking his anger out on Peter was wrong."Sirius is an idiot," he finally said, once he knew he wouldn't snap. "And he's very much so mistaken. You can tell him that, too. Both things. That he's mistaken, and an idiot."Peter sighed. "We just wanna help—""You are helping." Remus took a step closer to Pete, wishing he could get this through their heads. "I've said it countless times. You're all there for me in ways nobody else would be." Peter looked like he wanted to say something more, but didn't. "Please believe me. All three of you have made my life... so much better.""You guys have made mine better too," Peter said dubiously. "But what's so wrong with us trying?""There are better ways to spend your time," Remus said, resuming walking again. "Like studying." Pete gave a snort, and Remus smiled. "Fine, like coming up with pranks."Peter darted forward and linked his arm with Remus's, squeezing gently. They walked arm in arm back to the tower while Remus tried his best to squash the fury down even more. He didn't want them wasting so much time on him. He already took up too much time and attention with his issues, he didn't want to be such a... a focus. There were so many more important things than him! He wished they would understand./\/\/\/\/\Once morning hit, all four boys were very giggly about the prank. They got dressed in their uniforms, James got his broom, and Remus had Fawley's string. They went under the cloak and headed through the school, as it was before second years were permitted to be out and about in the mornings.The set up went without a hitch. Remus and Peter hid out while Sirius put the sticking spell on the door and James stuck the string down. It still glowed faintly blue until the four of them put the heart bubble spell on it. They couldn't test to see if it worked, since if it did work one of them would have a heart bubble before going into breakfast; all they could do was return to the dorm to put James's broom away and also grab their school supplies. By this point it was seven and Remus and Peter casually made their way down to the Great Hall, with James and Sirius under the cloak behind them. They reached the Great Hall by seven-twenty, and they knew it worked since there was a commotion inside.The two of them hid smiles as they walked through, feeling the spell hit them. They both made loud noises of shock as large, pink, heart-shaped bubbles expanded over their heads and began floating along with them, a few feet above them. There were several students already there (all with the bubbles) and a few teachers (also with bubbles). Remus and Peter took seats at the Gryffindor table, trying not to laugh.Professor McGonagall approached them pretty much right away. They kicked at each others' ankles and put their most innocent faces on. "P-Professor!" Remus said, hoping he sounded confused. "What's going on?" He pointed at the heart bubble. "Is this part of the—the decorations?" The room was already decked out with pink, red, and white everywhere. Streamers, heart shapes, even confetti fluttering down and disappearing before it hit the tables. The heart bubbles fit in perfectly."Where are Misters Potter and Black?" she inquired very firmly."In bed," Peter said, slathering marmalade all over a piece of toast. "'Least they were when we left.""You two usually aren't at breakfast on Wednesday mornings," she noted.Panic filled Peter's eyes and Remus gave him another kick. "We're going to—to the library after," he said quickly. "Peter needs help with some assignments."Peter gave an eager nod in agreement. "Yeah, I'm a little behind in homework."McGonagall looked down her nose at them. "I see. You have no idea about what could have caused this?"Remus looked up at the one floating above his head. "I've—I've never read about a spell like this," he answered with absolute honesty."Hmm." She still looked suspicious. "I see. Thank you." She returned to the teachers' table to talk to Professor Dumbledore. Dumbledore glanced down at them then back at McGonagall, shrugging.As students came in and got hit with the spell they complained loudly but soon gave up when they realized the bubbles weren't doing them any harm. Some of the students started up games of swatting their heart balloons away. One Hufflepuff tried stabbing hers until Sprout asked her to please put the knife away.Eventually Lily, Colgate, and Inkwood came in and all three made startled noises when their balloons appeared. They whispered at each other then Inkwood pointed at Remus and Peter.Lily led the way, marching over. Peter gave a snort, sliding down low in his seat to avoid the glaring as best he could. Remus glanced up through his fringe. "M—morning," he said as innocently as he could."Don't you morning me, I know you did this," she said, indicating the bubble floating above her. "Heart. Bubble."Remus gulped, remembering the incident in the library when he told her the Welsh words. "Ahhh..."Lily let out a sigh and plopped down next to Remus with Inkwood on her other side, and Colgate sitting with Peter who went bright pink. "I mean, obviously it was Black and Potter's idea. I'm blaming them.""N-not everything is—is us," Remus tried and Lily gave him such a glare that he shrank back and quietly went back to his food."I think it's sweet," Inkwood said, looking up at hers with a smile."And it's harmless," added Colgate. "Which, considering some of their other pranks, is a bit of a marvel."Inkwood reached up and batted at her bubble, watching it bobbing around. "It's kinda romantic. Was it Sirius's idea?""Actually—" Peter began, and Remus kicked his shin. "OUCH!""Actually," Remus said, "we don't kn—know what d-did this."Lily gave him another one of those looks, but Remus was saved from further withering by James and Sirius showing up, much earlier than planned. They were laughing about the bubbles and kept twirling around, trying to get their bubbles to knock against one another without them physically touching them."Morning," Sirius said, sitting next to Inkwood who began giggling."Morning!" James said brightly then stopped in his tracks. "Whoa, Evans, what's with the hat?"That's when Remus realized Lily had a rather bulky hat jammed over her head, and all her hair tucked up underneath except for a few stray strands which stuck out at odd angles.Lily went red. "My hat is none of your business, Potter!""It's not that cold inside." James was studying the hat with a really awful grin on his face; Remus had a bad feeling. "It kinda looks like you're hiding something.""Stay away from me or I'll jam a spoon up your nose!" Lily threatened, waving a spoon at him.James took a step back. "Calm down, Red! I think the hat suits you.""Hmph.""It's really hiding your hair.""I'm not—"James reached out and yanked the hat off. Lily shrieked, hands flying to her head as her hair sprang wildly out. It was a mass of unruly curls that went everywhere. Peter dropped his fork while James and Sirius began laughing.Lily gave a cry and scrambled off the bench. "You—you—you—" but she couldn't figure out an adequate enough insult, and fled from the Great Hall."YOU FORGOT YOUR HAT!" James shouted after her, flailing the hat over his head, causing the bubble to bounce wildly around."Potter that was so mean!" Colgate snapped, getting up to go after Lily."You jerk!" added Inkwood, following suit."That was extremely mean," Remus said, and went after Lily too. When he passed through the door he was hit with the spell again—something he hadn't thought about—and followed Colgate and Inkwood down the hall. Lily was tucked away in a side corridor, covering her face as her shoulders shook.Inkwood and Colgate flopped onto either side of her, rubbing her back, and giving her words of comfort as well as insulting James. Six bubbles bobbed above the three of them"I w-w-wanted to l-look nice tonight," Lily sniffled at Remus. "I t-t-tried the spell last night and—and Veronica t-t-told me it would wear off by morning but it's worse! I w-went to P-Pomfrey but she—she said—""It w-wasn't a m-m-medical emergency," Remus finished for her, and Lily gave him a look. "I'm s-s-sorry James did that.""He's awful!" She wiped her nose off on her sleeve. "I hate him! I completely hate him! I mean, Black can be annoying but Potter is downright awful! I can't stand him!""Lily—" Remus tried, unable to finish as the other girls began talking over him.Inkwood pressed her face against Lily's shoulder. "He deserves detention for the rest of his life.""Like detention ever stopped him before," muttered Colgate, still rubbing Lily's back. "He doesn't care about anything but himself.""Lily," Remus tried again."Lupin, I know you want to help but this isn't really in your realm," Inkwood said in a rather condescending manner that pushed Remus's buttons. His entire body stiffened, and a rude retort rose to his tongue. He quickly bit it back."Yeah, no offense but Potter's your friend, and you're a boy so you wouldn't understand," Colgate agreed.Remus considered walking away. If they didn't want his help, so be it. He nearly did... except Lily was his friend (pinky promised friend) and he couldn't leave her in the lurch. He pulled his wand out and tapped Lily's nest of red curls. "Teresium," he said.Lily jerked then her jaw dropped as her curls uncurled, and fell in a straight cascade past her shoulders. She grabbed a hank of hair and pulled it forward to look at, letting the strands slip through her fingers. Inkwood and Colgate stared in shock."How did...?" Lily looked up at Remus and then jumped to her feet, flinging her arms around him. "Thank you!"Remus went rather pink, wishing Lily would let go of his neck. "Er, w—well, um, it's not—ahhh—you're w-w-welcome...""Veronica said there wasn't a spell to undo the curls!" Inkwood complained."Th—there i—isn't," Remus said, wondering if shoving Lily away would be a bad idea or not. "Not technic—nically. It—it's j-just a spell to—to st-straighten the hair."Then Lily did one of the worst things possible: she kissed his cheek. A big kiss, right on his cheek. Inkwood and Colgate fell into giggles, and Remus went even pinker, knowing this would make things worse. The two girls chorused 'oooooooh', then Colgate said she thought Lily was going to the dessert thing with Struthers. Remus was a little surprised at that news."I am!" Lily said, finally releasing Remus's neck."You kissed Lupin," Inkwood said, covering her mouth."Only on the cheek," she argued, putting her hands on her hips. "Remus is my friend!""Just your friend?" Colgate asked."Yes!"Remus took a few steps back, tugging at his sleeve. "Er—I, uh, b-b-better get b—back to breakfast..." Without waiting for anyone to say anything he ran back to the Great Hall, getting his with the spell again so he now had three heart bubbles over his head. He slumped onto the bench next to James, glad they hadn't seen the cheek kiss.James gave Remus a smile that didn't falter at all when Remus glowered at him. "All good?" he asked."No! That was awfully mean of you." he snapped back."Aw. Don't worry, I'll apologize—oh! Her hair is back to normal." James sounded a little disappointed."Go apologize," Remus said, elbowing James."Fine, fine." He got up, messing his hair up as he went over to where the girls sat not too far down the table. "Here's your hat back," he said, offering it out. Lily snatched it from his hands, shoving it into her bag. "Um. Well.""Yes?" she asked snippily.James messed his hair up yet again. "Sorry," he snipped right back, and then returned to his seat. "There. I apologized."Before anything else could be said on the matter, the owl post interrupted them. Namely, valentines flooding in. Sirius got several, James got a couple, and Remus got one to his absolute shock. The envelope was very light pink, and inside was a card with some flowers and hearts drawn on it. You're simply the sweetest and cutest second year. I wish I was going to the Valentine's dessert with you. I wish you would see me. It was signed with a heart."Aren't you gonna read yours?" Peter asked glumly, watching James completely ignore his valentines. Sirius was ripping through his many, reading them, and setting them aside."Nope," James replied, shoveling food in his mouth. Peter poked at his food miserably. James stopped eating, and pushed his envelopes over. "You can have them."Peter's face went a little red, while Remus winced a little at James's words. "Th—that's not—it d-doesn't work like that!" he pointed out, feeling bad for poor Peter.James blinked a few times, realization settling in that his offer, while done with good intentions, wasn't a very kind thing to do. "Er, well." He ruffled his hair, trying to figure out how to smooth his blunder over. "You know, if I were to send one, you'd get it.""Ditto," Remus said, going back to his food."Yeah me too," agreed Sirius, finishing his last card."Mmm, three valentines from my friends, real nice," Pete grumbled, slumping down. Remus felt awful and wondered if he could send a card to Peter the next day or if that'd be a not-so-good thing to do. Peter was the sweetest second year and deserved valentines."Remy, what's yours say?" Sirius asked curiously.That shook him out of his pondering over sending something to Peter. "Hmm? I don't know, something about the dessert and seeing her." Remus shrugged, already forgetting most of the card contents."Not from Evans?" Sirius pressed.Remus glared at him. "No! Why would it be?"The others believed him for the time being but unfortunately not for very long, because after Charms (which was fun with all the heart bubbles everywhere, including over Flitwick's head) Sirius barreled towards Remus nearly knocking James over, demanding to know about him and Lily kissing."Wh—what?!" Remus squeaked."WHAT?!" James screeched."What?!" Pete yelped.Remus shook his head, horror sweeping through his body. "Who s-s-said that?!""Cassie," Sirius said, a frown on his face. "She says Evans kissed you this morning, for fixing her hair.""Evans kissed you!?" James grabbed Remus's arm. "And you didn't say anything?!""Merlin!" Peter said, clapping excitedly. "You got kissed!""NO!" he shouted, furious. How could Inkwood say that?! Why would she say that? "She—it—it w-w-was on my—my cheek! As a—a th-th—thanks!"James deflated a little. "Just on the cheek?""Yes!" Remus snapped.James looked very disappointed. Sirius, however, seemed a little cheerier."A kiss on the cheek is still a bit impressive," said Peter. "I've only ever been kissed on my finger.""James has never been kissed at all," Sirius added with a smirk.James's eyes flashed a little as he cocked his head, fixating his eyes on Sirius. "Says who?""All right, then, who kissed you?""I—well—that—" James spluttered then pushed his glasses up, scowling. "All right, well, only family, but I still could have been kissed by someone! You don't assume!"Sirius snickered, and yanked James in for a half-hug. "Maybe if you fix Evans's hair she'll give you a kiss on the cheek," he said before making sloppy kissing sounds near James's ear.James gave a loud squeal of disgust and shoved Sirius away, wiping at near where Sirius's lips were. "I'd rather kiss Rocky.""Bet that could be arranged," said Peter, and everyone—except Remus—laughed.Remus was too busy seething with rage. "What exactly did Inkwood say?" he asked Sirius.Sirius pulled a bit of parchment out of his pocket, handing it over. In cursive it said, by the way theres going to be drama tonight. Then: why? - SB. Back to Inkwood's writing: lily is going with struthers to the dessert but she kissed lupin this morning since he fixed her hair followed by several heart doodles.Remus stared at the words, the wolf stirring violently. He wanted to rip the paper up, but the note didn't belong to him. Calmly, he gave the note back to Sirius. Or he tried to be calm, anyway; his hand was shaking a little bit, betraying what was going on underneath."You all right?" Sirius asked, noticing the shaking."No! She lied!" Remus hissed out, clenching his teeth, trying to keep the wolf pushed down. It was panting for revenge, pawing at Remus's soul to do something about all of this."If she kissed your cheek it isn't really a lie, is it?" Peter asked."Yes! That—that m-makes it sound like we kissed on the—the—the lips!" Remus waved his hand at the note.Apparently Sirius wasn't the only one told because at lunch Struthers came over to Remus to tell him if he wanted to take Lily that'd be fine. Remus said he didn't want to, and why would Struthers think that? Struthers replied that Spinnet told him that Inkwood told him that Lily and Remus kissed that morning."It w-w-w-w—" Remus was too angry to even explain.Sirius explained for him. "It was only on the cheek.""Oh." Struthers looked a little awkward. "Sorry. I thought—well, anyway. Sorry." He quickly stalked back to Spinnet.Remus was too busy trying to push the wolf back down. His head rang, and black crept into his vision. Inkwood was going around saying...! Spreading lies! It was annoying enough everyone assuming they were a couple because they were friends... now nobody would believe otherwise! He looked down the table where Lily sat with them, wondering if Lily knew Inkwood was saying this."I'm not hungry." Remus shoved his plate away, grabbing his satchel. "I'm going to the library.""Remy—" Sirius said, but Remus stormed out of the Great Hall, getting his fifth heart bubble. The first three were sagging slightly though not much. It had been a little entertaining when they first went to lunch and saw the sea of heart bubbles but now Remus was too angry to care how well his original spell was working.Instead of the library, he went to the Pits Passage to pace around, tugging at his hair and muttering under his breath. He was dimly aware of the gossip and rumors that spread through the school, however he had never paid much attention. Had never really cared. Now he was the object of gossip, at least a little bit; hopefully, it would only stay within the second years but he had a sinking feeling it wouldn't.

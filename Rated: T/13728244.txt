Mr. and Mrs. Granger were a lucky couple. They gave birth to two geniuses, a boy and a girl. The boy was Kent Granger and the girl was Hermione Granger.The brother and the sister, both were geniuses, not only for their academic excellence but also maturity. Anybody who interacts with the pair, praises Mr. and Mrs. Granger for giving birth to such good children.In fact both Mr. and Mrs. Granger themselves were very happy, not only because their children were geniuses but also for their filial piety.But who would've thought that reality was completely different.Kent Granger was in fact not actually the child of Mr. and Mrs. Granger, at least his soul or consciousness wasn't.He had memories of 30 years of life in a world quite similar to the current one, at least on the surface.If his guess was correct, then there might be another magical world hidden under the plain sight.The reason he suspected this was because his sister's name is Hermione Granger, who is two hours younger than him.He had watched the full Harry Potter series and their was a character named 'Hermione Granger', one of the lead characters played by Emma Watson.She looks a lot different than what was portrayed in the movie, her hair was more bushy and her front teeth were more distinct. The most confusing was her personality. She was mature and not so overbearing as shown in the movie. She might've acquired that quirk later.Kent sometimes suspects that she was more adult than him. It was quite a mystery.But he did not have the time to solve the mystery because if his speculations were correct and this world was indeed the fictional world of magic then it got a hundred fold dangerous especially if you're related to one of the main protagonists.There was another mystery, which was "how he died?". He didn't have the specific memory about it. He was going to marry the girl he was in love with. His last memory was meeting with his friends and inviting them to his marriage.The mystery was quite difficult to solve so he temporarily gave up, instead he started preparing for the worst.It didn't take long to confirm his guess though.On his and his sister's fifth birthday, there was a bizarre incident that happened which might be puzzling for the Granger Couple but for Kent it just confirmed his guess.A book was flung from the bookcase straight to Hermione's cousin who was making fun of her teeth. Fortunately her cousin was alright.This was a case of accidental magic. And it might indeed be the fictional world of Harry Potter or a parallel world quite close to the original fiction. He was not sure if his foreknowledge would be of any use. But that was a thing of far future at least six years later.Kent only hoped that he also had magic otherwise he didn't know how he would cope with the dangerous future that was probably gonna happen.As a muggle, he would be quite defenseless against magic.It didn't take long for his worries to transform into excitement though.On that night after the joint birthday celebrations when Kent was lying on his bed worrying about his future, a clicking noise sounded in his head.[Ding! Simulation system is Activated!]A string of white letters was floating in front of his eyes. He rubbed his eyes, but the string of letters was still present. He tried touching them but couldn't. It did not take long for him to calm down and think properly.'Okay then, I've got a system but I don't know what it's functions are. First I have check what this system is all about,' he thought as he took a long breath."Now let's see..., System what is your function?" asked Kent lowering his voice so as to not disturb his sister and parents.There was no response."Lord System, may I know what is your function and purpose?"Still no response."System, please?""B*ullsh*t System," Kent cursed out loud."Kent, what happened?" came a female voice from the next room. It was his mother."Nothing Mom, just some annoying fly," said Kent."Okay, sleep early son."'I might be hallucinating then,' concluded Kent after getting no response from the system.But there was still a bit unwillingness in him. So he decided to try again for the last time.This time, instead of shouting or cursing, Kent decided to concentrate on string of letters that was still floating in front of his eyes.Suddenly his vision darkened and he felt a suction force. But it was just momentary.As soon as his vision returned, he found himself in a dark room.Looking around he couldn't see the end of the room. There was like hue that was obstructing his vision.Suddenly a subtly glowing screen appeared in front him. It looked just like those 3d hologram in Sci-fi movies.Taking a closer look, he found that it was a panel with five options.oooDeduce and OptimizeSimulationLibraryDownloadInventoryooo'It's real!' exclaimed Kent in his mind.Coming closer, Kent clicked on the first option "Deduce and Optimize".The screen changed.oooDeduce and Optimize: With the help of the information stored in the library, the user can deduce and optimize anything, ranging from a solution of a question to optimizing martial arts skill etc. The user can also specify the requirements of the optimized result. There are currently five skills or solution that can be optimized simultaneously.Slots [5]1. (empty)2. (empty)3. (empty)4. (empty)5.

After that he checked each option one by one.oooSimulation: After optimization of certain skill, the user can experience and practice the skill. The time spent here is 100 times faster compared to real world.(Back)ooo"Hmm, this look useful. I have to test it. I will try it tomorrow." Kent muttered as he clicked on the next option.oooLibrary: The user can consciously store any form of data like book, picture, sound or symbol they see or hear. It serves as a data centre.(Tips: No matter what language the data is in, the user can translate the said data to understandable language.)Current Content : (Empty)(Back)ooo'Wow! That's a useful function!' Kent exclaimed in his mind. Returning to the previous page, he then clicked on the "Download" option.oooDownload: The user can download any data from the library to his conscious memory.Warning: May induce headache during downloadReminder: A humans memory is not unlimited.(Delete: User can clear certain data from their memory)(Back)ooo'With this, I can claim to have a photographic memory.' Kent concluded with excitement."Now let's see, the last one. Hmm, I hope it is what I think it is," Kent muttered as he clicked on the 'Inventory' option.oooInventory:A storage space of 5 cubic metres. Living beings are not recommended to be stored.Current Content: (Empty)ooo"Hmm, neither too large nor too small. Well it's enough space. It's a pity that living beings can not be stored." Kent sighed. He was not disappointed though. It was already a miracle to have a multifunction system.Suddenly a thought came to his mind."How do I get out of this place?" He asked himself."Let's try this."Closing his eyes he concentrated on the feeling when he was sucked into this place and thought about going out.And just like that he again felt a similar suction force and the next moment he found himself sitting on his bed, probably on the same spot before he entered into the black space of the system. He checked the time to find that he spent about half an hour inside the system space.After an hour of excitement, thinking about the future, how he would use the system to its best capacity, Kent was exhausted. After all it was a five year old body.He yawned and switched off the lamp. Lying on his bed it didn't take long before he fell asleep.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?

The next morning, Kent woke up a bit earlier than usual. Everyone including his parents were sound asleep.Yesterday's excitement still hadn't died down and he also wanted to confirm that the system was not a dream.Suppressing his hunger, he concentrated on the system. But unlike yesterday there was no suction force, instead the same panel appeared in front of his eyes.He was still in his room, just the screen was floating in front of him. He clicked on the "Optimization" option and just like previous time, another page appeared containing the description of its function."Phew! Fortunately it wasn't just a dream," he sighed with relief."Hey! Kent what are you doing?" came a girl's voice from the door which was ajar. She had already entered the room."Whaâ€“?! Oh! Hermione, why are you here?" Quickly composing himself, Kent asked while pretending not to see the screen projected in front of him. He was also paying attention to Hermione, curious if she could see the screen."I just heard some noise from your room. As you never wake up so early, I thought I'd check up," answered Hermione."By the way, what were you doing waving your hand in mid-air?" she added with a doubtful look."Oh! Nothing, just that I was still sleepy and my eyes were a bit groggy." said Kent making up some stupid excuse under Hermione's scrutinizing gaze.But inside he was panicking.'Phew! Almost got caught, I have to be more cautious. Hermione is sharper than I thought. At least she can't see or touch the system screen,' he thought calming his nerve."Okay then, I'm gonna wake mom and dad," said Hermione."I've to brush my teeth," groaned Kent. As a son of two dentists, there's a distinct emphasis on dental health.After having breakfast, due to not having school today, Kent went went to the public library 10 minutes walk from home. Mr. and Mrs. Granger found nothing unusual about it though. After learning to read and write, Kent always have been fond of reading books. As for Kent himself, he had to endure 4 years of wobbly hand and feet to get used to the new body.Also, not to attract too much attention, he had to pretend to be a normal four year old boy occasionally showing some mature behaviour so as to appear as genius. Gradually he was able to show some of his excellence without garnering unwanted attention.With an equally excellent Hermione, the genius of the brother-sister pair was attributed to their genes."Hermione, do you wanna go to the library with me?" asked Kent."No, I will be staying at home for today." answered Hermione."Are you okay?" asked Kent as he brought his hands to Hermione's forehead to check her temperature."I am okay. I just don't feel like going to library today." said Hermione, avoiding Kent's hand."Oh, okay then," Kent sighed with disappointment but inside he was happy. He would be able to experiment with the newly acquired system without any difficulty.After 10 minutes of happy walk, Kent reached a huge building with an equally large door. The structure of the building was a bit old styled but that didn't diminish its majesty a bit.Checking in with the librarian, Kent took a book on exercises from the shelf and sat at one corner of the long table.No one was surprised seeing Kent reading a oversized book compared to his tiny hands, an annoyance Kent always complaining and grumbling about.The reason for the lack of surprise seeing a five year old boy reading a bit advanced book was Kent and Hermione's frequent visit to library as well as being an well known genius in the neighbourhood. They were a local celebrity.Opening the first page, Kent brought up the system panel and then the 'Library' option. After familiarising himself with system, Kent found that he didn't need to physically touch the screen to operate the system. With a mere thought everything could be done; it requires a bit of practice and concentration.Activating the library function, Kent read the book word by word. He didn't need to understand or read out loud the words.He finished reading the book within fifteen minutes as there were more pictures than words.One by one, Kent went to shelf and took out various books on exercises and martial arts.It was already noon when he was finished recording all the information available in the library about Martial arts and exercises.Although Kent's behaviour was a bit unusual today, the librarian didn't question him.'Maybe he didn't find what he was looking for,' thought the librarian. On asking, Kent simply said he was looking for more comprehensive book on martial arts.On hearing Kent's answer, the librarian suggested the name of some bookstores where he could find better martial arts book. The librarian also suggested that it was better to look for a dojo. Martial arts is after all oriented toward physical work rather than books and pen.Kent nodded and thanked the librarian for the advice. Kent couldn't just say that he had a system which could optimize and simulate martial arts. He himself even doubted the credibility of the said function of the system. Only time would tell whether it is as good as the description says.Saying goodbye to the librarian, Kent went home.After having lunch, Kent directly went to his room. After locking the door, he sat cross-legged on his bed and opened the system panel.After activating the "Optimize" option, a new page opened up.ooo[Finalise what you want as an optimized output](Blank)[Select the data based on which you want to optimize the result](1. Essence of Martial Arts by Jim Hoblin)(2. Martial Arts for dummies by Rob Demiurge)(3...)(4...)(5...)[Specify the basic qualities and purpose you want in your finalized output](Blank)(Submit) (Back)oooThe instructions were pretty clear, so Kent filled the first blank as (Martial arts that exercises and builds my body to its finest).As for selecting the data, he selected all 53 books, he recorded today in the library.Finally for the basic qualities and purpose, he wrote (1. No bulging or extra muscle, 2. No extra unnecessary movement, 3. Flexible and strong wrist, 4. Subdue your enemy in the fastest possible time, 5. Good evasion, 6. Short burst of high speed movement)Then with a thought, he submitted his entries. In the next moment, panel returned to it's previous page but there was an extra line under the "Deduce and Optimize" option.oooDeduce and OptimizeSlot[1] (Martial arts that exercises and builds my body to its finest [Estimated completion time 1 day 2 hours 5 minutes]SimulationLibraryDownloadInventoryooo"Now that the optimization is taking place, let's check the download function," muttering excitedly, Kent clicked on the 'Download' option and chose a book to download. After confirming his selection, with a thought he activated the process.The next moment..."Argh," groaned Kent while rubbing his forehead.'Sh*t! There was clearly a "mild" word before headache in the warning, so why the hell does it hurt so much?' Kent cursed in his mind.'Is my pain tolerance so little?' he shook his head so as to deny his own speculation.Soon the pain subsided and a new set of knowledge was present in his brain. It was like he memorised word by word and even the pictures were vivid."The pain was worth it though," he cheered."Now Let's check the 'Inventory' function," he decided.He picked up a toy car and then mentally activated the "Inventory" function. The toy car vanished from his right hand as if his hand wasn't holding anything before.He then reactivated the "Inventory" function, this time it was not to store something but to take the toy car that was stored inside the storage space. With a mental command, the small toy car appeared in his right hand.After experimenting with the "Inventory", Kent found that if he wanted to store an object, he must touch it with his bare skin, be it hand, leg or any other part of his body. Also the object must not shake too much or the speed of object must not exceed a certain speed relative to his body. The speed limit was yet to be determined; it required a more rigorous experiment.Checking the time, he found that it had already been 2 hours since he started experimenting with various functions of the system.As for the remaining two functions, he had to wait for the optimization to finish to ascertain the usefulness of the two said functions, whether their description was on point.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?

The next day, it was already 4 pm when Kent and Hermione returned from school. There was no fatigue whatsoever, instead a small smile hung on his face. Inside he was filled with excitement.He found that the process of optimization was finished. Now he only needed to check it.Suppressing his excitement, he with his sister Hermione ate their meal. After that he directly went to his room, saying he wanted to have a rest.Locking the door, he sat on the bed. With a thought, the system panel appeared in front of him.oooDeduce and OptimizeSlot[1] (Martial arts that exercises and builds my body to its finest [Complete]SimulationLibraryDownloadInventoryoooKent clicked on the "Slot[1]", a new page appeared. There was a download option below it, he clicked on it.Unlike yesterday, the severe headache that Kent was ancipating didn't come, instead it was far milder.'Did my pain tolerance go up?' He thought doubtfully, but soon it was replaced with excitement as a new set knowledge appeared in his mind. It included a set movement, the breathing rhythm, even the slightest movement of fingers were included.'It's too precise,' he thought.'Is it any effective though? But before that let's see how the simulation works.'Returning to the previous page he clicked on the 'Simulation' option. A new page appeared.oooSimulationSimulate (Martial arts that exercises and builds my body to its finest)?(Yes) (No)(Back)oooKent clicked on 'Yes', a new page appeared.The next moment, his surroundings changed from his room to a grass field. As far as eyes could see there was only green. There was no trees, houses or mountains, just plain grassland.Soon the system panel appeared.[Simulation Starts in 10 seconds][10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...0]When the countdown was finished, Kent found that his body was moving on its own.After few seconds, he realised that his body was moving according to the set of movements he just got. Even the breathing was not in his control. He could feel twitch of each muscle but couldn't control it.So instead of resisting, Kent started going with the flow. It went on for about an hour until his body stopped.There was no physical or mental fatigue.'It must be due the fact that it's just a simulation,' he whimsily concluded.In the last hour, his body repeated the movements about five times.A new page appeared on the system panel.oooManual Practice Progress: 0%25% - (Beginner)50% - (Intermediate)75% - (Master)100% - (Perfection)oooKent understood the purpose of the manual practice. Although in the auto pilot his body would move according to the optimized movements but it was after all auto pilot. To realise the movements in real life Kent needed to master them on his own.Kent closed his eyes, steadied his breath. Recalling his experience earlier during automatic simulation, he started moving.It was slow at first as Kent had to keep account of everything including movement of fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulders, knee and also rhythm of breathing, even breathing using the abdominal muscle.It was really difficult at first. But gritting his teeth, he kept going on. Whenever there was a slight mistake, a beep would sound in his mind and his body would go to auto pilot mode to correct his movements.He didn't know how many times he failed, but he didn't give up. The circumstances didn't allow him to give up.The knowledge of the terrible futurehad always been weighing on his mind. The emergence of the system did reduce some worries but still the main thing had to be done by him. He didn't have the luxury to slack.Sometimes he thinks it would be better if he knew nothing of the future.'No! I have atleast a fighting chance with foreknowledge I have,' he yelled at his lazy self.Without any further distraction, he fully concentrated on moving and breathing according to the knowledge he had gained earlier.As there was no fatigue and hunger, he gradually lost track of time. His mastery over the set of movements gradually increased until it reached perfection.[Manual Practice Progress: 100%] Getting the notification, Kent stopped. Looking at the screen, a huge smile bloomed on his face.He exited from the Simulation panel. The surroundings again change back to his room. Looking at the clock, he found that only 1 hour has passed in real world. According to the time ratio of 100:1, he spent about four days in the simulation space.Thinking about this, he was very excited. He wanted to practice the set movements in real life but remembering about how he pretended to be exhausted in front of his family, he gave up.'Well, I'll start exercising from tomorrow,' he decided. Now that he had achieved perfection in the simulation space, he had a feeling that he would make no mistake during practice in real life.The next morning, Kent woke very early. It was cold but the excitement that comes from doing something new overwhelmed the coldness of the weather. After taking care of hygiene, Kent changed to a set of comfortable clothes suitable for exercise.In the backyard, under the dim light of the dawn, Kent started practicing in a steady manner. After a while he found that the set of movement had become an Instinct to him.'So that's what system meant by perfection,' mused Kent as his movements become more rapid.After doing 3 rounds of continuous movement, Kent stopped. He was very exhausted.'First time exercising is always difficult,' he consoled himself.Taking a five minute rest, he again started practicing. This time he could do only 2 rounds of practice. After that he had no energy to move around.'I may have to optimize a nutritional drink tailor made for me,' Kent decided.As far as he was concerned, it was not very difficult to concoct a nutrition drink with help of the optimize function of the system, he only needed to record information on biology and chemistry.In fact he had already decided that he was going to record every "knowledge worthy" books from the libraries in the upcoming days. It might require years but he had time. He decided so because everytime he needed to find solutions to something new, he didn't need to run everywhere to collect data. Its far more convenient to have everything that you need, in your reach.Practicing for another half an hour, Kent went to shower.Despite the cold, his morning practice warmed him up enough to resist the chilly weather. The hot water from the geyser also helped.During breakfast...Mr. and Mrs. Granger was sitting side by side on one side of the square table, opposite to them on the other side of table, Kent and Hermione were sitting."Kent, why did you shower so early?" asked Mrs. Granger with a bit of concern.It was early December, the weather had already started to get colder than usual. Mrs. Granger was worried that Kent would catch a cold. She knew that Kent was far mature than his peers, so she found it unnecessary to reprimand him."It was because I had become sweaty after exercising," answered Kent."Hey Hermione, wanna do exercise with meâ€“ *cough*" Kent almost choked on his food."Eat before you talk!" chided Mrs. Granger."Okay okay," said Kent as he drank some water."Hmm, okay," Hermione nodded in response to Kent's offer."Good," Kent smiled.After being reborn in this world Kent had always been worrying about the future. As a result he didn't paid attention to Hermione. But still he noticed some peculiarities about Hermione, especially her maturity. He could clearly remember from the movie that although Hermione was brilliant but was never that mature.'Well, the fiction also didn't have a brother of Hermione,' mused Kent in his thoughts."Whatever," muttered Kent as he continued eating."Did you say anything?" asked Hermione who was sitting beside him."Nothing," responded Kent.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

It had been a month since Kent got the simulation system and he had never been happier.The set of optimized exercises that he got was far more magical than he thought. In only two weeks he could feel the difference. His stamina, speed, flexibility and reflex, everything had been enhanced. Additionally the nutrition drink he optimized using the system was a great supplement for his and Hermione's exercise.They both grew a few centimetres in the last month.It was impossible for Hermione to copy the the set of exercises to exact details as she didn't have the simulation system and also her physic was of a female, so there ought to be few deviation but the end result were pretty good.Hermione was also very happy and at the same time a bit shocked. Well, anybody ought to be shock when a set of pretty ordinary exercise could produce such magical result.In the past month, there had been another major thing that happened, that is, he and Hermione got along pretty well. Earlier she was a bit colder to him, to which Kent couldn't find any reason.Seeing the magical effect of the 'Optimization', Kent optimized another set of exercise just for wrist and finger movements. It was for easier and faster wand movement in the future. He didn't share it with Hermione as he couldn't say that he knew that they were magical and they would get Hogwarts letter on their 11th birthday.As for how Kent knew that he was a wizard, it was the leaky cauldron. No muggle would be able to see much less enter the leaky cauldron, but he could see and also enter. He didn't linger much as he didn't want to venture into the magical world without much protection.In addition to doing exercise daily and practicing the set of wrist movements Kent also kept recording any valuable books he got, Mathematics, Engineering, Computer Science, Electronics, Chemistry, Physics and Biology and also the auxiliary subjects like drawing, sculpting, designing and many more. He didn't need the knowledge at present but it might be required in the future. He also wanted to start early in the magical education but considering the risk of exposing himself to the magical world early, he gave up the thought.Well he didn't want to eat more than what he could chew.In the spare times, he searched particularly for books or any form of knowledge about runes, ancient relics, metaphysics and mythology and chinese qi(spirit) meditation available in the non-magical world. He wanted to develop a skill like 'danger sense', so that he could have a better chance at surviving the bleak future.He knew it would be difficult but that didn't stop him from trying. The first two trials ended in failure. When he set the desired function and purpose of the skill and selected the appropriate data from the 'Library', he got the notification that there was not enough relevant data.'Who knows how much knowledge I need to collect to develop the skill! Will I even be able to develop such skill? No! I can't give up!' Kent was in a dilemma. As there was no convenient mode of acquiring knowledge like Internet on a mobile or a laptop, it was pretty difficult to go around libraries and bookshops to collect the necessary data. It takes a lot of time.'Well, I will collect as much as possible in the spare time and after a year, I will try again to depelop the danger sense skill' he decided after some pondering.1 year later..."Finally, Lets hope that it will work this time," mumbled Kent. He was sitting on his bed with the door closed. It was nighttime, so it was unlikely that anyone would come but to be sure he locked the door from inside.Kent had collected as much as he could in the last year about metascience, mythology, runes etc.He opened the system page and clicked on the 'Optimize' option.ooo[Finalise what you want as an optimized output](Blank)[Select the data based on which you want to optimize the result](1.

It was because even if a piece of data was not relevant it would be excluded automatically.Its like if you want to develop a martial skill and select some data on martial arts and also data on how to cook, the system will still optimize the martial skill.After selecting the data, he specified the function of the skill, i.e., detect danger to oneself in advance including the direction in which the danger is coming. It would be disastrous if you know that danger is coming but don't know from where its coming.After rechecking all the entries, he hesitated for a moment but clenching his fist, he clicked submit."Fortunately!" Looking at the system screen, Kent sighed as if a heavy weight had been lifted off his shoulders.oooDeduce and OptimizeSlot[1] Advance danger sense [Estimated completion time 2 years 6 months 13 days]SimulationLibraryDownloadInventoryoooHe closed the system panel happily.Thinking about the future, it didn't take long before he fell asleep.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

Swish! Swish!Like a blur, Kent's hands and feet were moving in a synchronised pattern. The movements looked more like dance than martial arts.His right hand was holding a short stick like a baton.If a person looked closer, he would notice that Kent was manipulating the stick with just the index and middle finger. There wasn't even a hesitation. The movements were so fluid that the stick looked like an extra limb of the body, it was Kent's goal after all.For wizards and witches, wand is a vital part of their lives, a means to protect or destroy. As a person who knew the grim future of Harry Potter world, Kent was going to make sure that he would survive and his new family was safe from harm.For that he was doing his best. Doing exercise daily, drinking the 'not so tasty' nutrition fruit mix, reading and recording books or any form of useful data when he was free.Although the growth of his body was slowing down compared to the explosive growth in the first year after getting the system.He expected it and he was happy with it. It would be illogical to think that human body could grow indefinitely if given sufficient nutrients as well as doing exercises in a regular basis. There are other factors like growth hormones, genetic heredity, gravity etc. which influences the growth of human body.No matter how slow the growth was, Kent didn't give up. The martial art exercise was not just for the physical growth of the body but also stamina, speed, strength and flexibility. Although his body's growth had slowed down but the increase in the other attributes didn't slow down instead it sped up. He was now more in control of his own body. If he tried he could outperform most teenage athletes in their respective fields.Although Kent missed his adult body of his previous life but it was not that significant anymore. His new body was lot more flexible and stronger than his previous life's adult body. And he was gradually adapting to his new life as his previous life's memory was fleeting away like a breeze. Only the future plot of "Harry Potter" was intentionally recorded and memorized by him using the library and download function of the system.After exercising for an hour, he freshened up and drank the fruit mix he had prepared earlier. It had become a habit to keep extra two-three bottles of fruit mix in the freezer.Finishing the fruit mix, he went to his room without waking others up.Hermione had a headache yesterday night, so Kent decided to exercise today without her.Thinking about system, he was excited. He waited for nearly two and a half year for countdown of the 'Advance danger sense' skill to finish.There was only few minutes left before the optimization of the skill was completed.Closing the door of his room, he sat on his bed and opened the system panel. Although the panel was invisible to others but Kent always felt insecure opening the panel out in the open if not necessary.oooDeduce and OptimizeSlot[1] Advance danger sense [Complete]SimulationLibraryDownloadInventoryoooWithout any hesitation he opened the completed 'Advance danger sense' skill and downloaded the same into his memory. There was no headache or even a slight pain whatsoever in the process of influx of new information into his memory.He was speechless after getting the information of the danger sense skill. According to the manual, he needed to imagine a set of pattern and symbol that were so intricate and complex that he felt dizzy just looking at them. It was said in the manual that not only you have to memorize the array of pattern but also have to visualise it for a duration of five minutes every three hours and you have to do it until it becomes an instinct. Only after making it an instinct will the skill to be considered completely mastered.Fortunately the 'Download' function of the system helped him imprint the complex pattern in details into his memory otherwise he didn't know how he could memorise the said pattern much less visualise, it would take much longer than what he would hope for. But now that the first step, that is, the memorisation of the array of symbol was completed, he only needed to visualise it every three hours.He knew that it would be a lot harder than it sounds, like when he's in school or while he's sleeping.He closed the system panel and quietly lied on the bed. He didn't use the Simulation function of system because he knew it won't work. Whenever there is a practice involving the mind, the Simulation function would show error saying that system cannot control the user's mind.The error didn't disappoint him, rather it reduced Kent's little worry about the system. He didn't want to be puppet of the system after all.Dismissing the distracting thoughts Kent watched the white ceiling of his room and pondered about the schedule for the practice of visualisation. The most troublesome thing is visualisation during sleep and class.Although the array of pattern was etched into his memory but consciously visualising the said pattern is entirely a different thing.Nonetheless he had to do it.He sighed and got up from his bed. Tidying up his room he went downstairs.His father was reading newspaper while his mother was preparing breakfast. It was not surprising that his parents didn't call him as they knew that he was awake."Dad, Where's Hermione?" asked Kent from the stairs."She's sleeping," answered Mr. Granger as he put down the newspaper."Oh," said Kent as he turned back to go upstairs."Kent, don't wake her up, she needs rest," came his mother's voice from the kitchen."OK mom, I'll just check if she's alright," replied Kent."Make sure you don't disturb her," added Mr. Granger in a serious tone."I won't disturb her, I promise," said Kent as he went upstairs to Hermione's room.Quietly opening the door to Hermione's room Kent went in and saw that Hermione was panting heavily in her sleep and her face was flushed.'Somethings wrong,' without any hesitation Kent placed his hand on her forehead.'She's burning!' he exclaimed."Mom! Dad! Hermione's having a fever and it's very high," yelled Kent from Hermione's room.Kent's shout woke Hermione from her sleep."No! not Harry, noo, Ahhh," screamed Hermione as she abruptly sat up.'Harry?' Kent's expression froze for a moment before he was distracted by the sound of a pair of footsteps coming from outside the room.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

"Whaâ€“?! Where am I?" asked Hermione looking around, confused and dazed."Calm down Hermione. You were having a nightmare," said Kent with a stiff expression. He still hadn't recovered from the previous shock.The door opened and Mr. and Mrs. Granger walked in.Seeing that his parents were already here, Kent made way for them."Let me check," said Mrs. Granger as she hurried forward.Putting her on Hermione's forehead she exclaimed, "You are burning, Hermione!""Dan, immediately call a doctor. Her temperature's too high," ordered Mrs. Granger."Uh, the phone's downstairs. Okay, you stay here. I'll be right back," said Mr. Granger as he hurried downstairs to make the phone call."Hermione, how are you feeling?" asked Mrs. Granger with concern."I... I feel a bit thirsty," answered Hermione weakly tilting her head sideways, confused."Kentâ€“""Here Mom," Kent handed over a glass of water he had already prepared, to Mrs. Granger.Taking the glass, Mrs. Granger let Hermione drink slowly from the glass."Okay, you lie down a bit. I'll go get the thermometer," said Mrs. Granger."Mom you stay here, I'll go," Kent offered to help. Without waiting for her reply Kent went downstairs."It's in the cupboard beside the Kitchen's door," informed Mrs. Granger loudly."Yeah, I know," answered Kent who was already halfway through the stairs.It was 2 o'clock at noon when Hermione's fever subsided. The doctor prescribed some antibiotics and advised her to have some rest.There was nothing serious, at least, the Granger couple were told so.But Kent had different thoughts. If he remembered it correct, Hermione uttered the name "Harry" before she woke up.'It can't be a coincidence,' Kent didn't think it was just a coincidence. Kent knew that they didn't have any relatives by the name "Harry" and as far as Kent could recall they also never had classmate named "Harry".That could only mean that Hermione dreamt something about the future and it wasn't a pleasant dream from what he could infer from her panicked face and scream.'It seems that I can't overly rely on my foreknowledge. I can at most take it as reference. Nothing more,' closing his eyes he organised his thoughts."And I have to hurry up and master the danger sense skill," muttered Kent. After today's incident, he felt more insequre and uncertain about the future. His presence alone might've changed the trajectory of the lives of various people.'Hope that, history's the same as I know otherwise my exclusive knowledge about many important secrets may become useless,' he prayed silently."Okay whatever, it's better to think about the present," throwing away the unnecessary thoughts, he sat upright on his bed and took a deep breath."What?!" He tried visualising one corner of the pattern but found that he could not. No matter how hard he tried he couldn't visualise portions of the pattern separately.After few more tries, he realised that he had to picture the whole pattern in his mind, only then could he practice.Without any further delay, he concentrated on the pattern.He didn't notice it before but after a minute of constantly visualising the pattern, he had a feeling that he was going to grasp something, something that felt so close and yet at the same time, very far. It was an illusory feeling.He couldn't quite understand what was happening but instinctively he kept trying to understand.Forgetting the passage of time he kept visualising the array of patterns before he was snapped out of the vague state with a sharp headache.He immediately felt sluggish as if his body had run a marathon.'What happened?' Kent was scared.'Was it the array of pattern? How much time did I spend visualisation?' He looked at the clock."Sh*t! It's been half an hour already!" Kent shouted out loud before he put his hands on the mouth and looked toward the closed door of his room anticipating a scolding from his parents, especially his mother for the use of inappropriate word."Phew! It was close," getting no response from downstairs, he heaved a sigh of relief."I have to set an alarm next time, otherwise I would be too tired to do anything other than practicing visualisation," he muttered feeling the fatigue.At the dinner table...While eating, Kent subtly observed Hermione who looked a lot better than before.'Frequent glances toward mom, opening mouth for no reason, occasional clenching of fist, tapping on table. Hermione must be anxious to talk about something. Is it about the nightmare?' Kent came to a conclusion.Recently he had compiled a comprehensive book on human psychology and behaviour using the system.Kent had watched TV show in his previous life where a former CIA officer was introducing how one can identify if someone was lying and even can tell what a person is thinking just by looking at their body language or facial expressions. It was even possible to manipulate one's action using subtle psychological cues.So he also wanted to try.But what he didn't expect that his decision to compile the psychology book would bring him such a surprise. It was like a non-magical version of Legilimency."Hermione, how are you feeling now?" asked Kent trying to get her attention."Uh, I'm okay," answered Hermione absent mindedly.Not getting Hermione's attention, Kent decided to test something."Harry Potter," said Kent."Wha- cough, cough," Hermione choked on her food.'I was right!' Kent cheered mentally."Here, have some water," Mrs. Granger who was sitting beside Hermione handed her the glass of water."Kent, don't talk while you're eating," chided Mrs. Granger in a stern voice, glaring at him."Sorry mom," apologised Kent meakly lowering his head. But his eyes were still on Hermione, secretly observing her body language and expression.It didn't take long before their eyes met.Kent gave a knowing smile to her curious and questioning look."We'll talk later, in the morning," said Kent as he passed by Hermione on the way to his room. It was a soft whisper audible enough to be heard by Hermione.She nodded after a slight hesitation.The brother-sister interaction remained unnoticed by the Granger couple who were discussing whether to open the clinic tomorrow.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

The next morning, Kent woke up a bit later than usual. The mental fatigue caused by the visualisation of the pattern for half an hour had far more serious consequences than he thought.'Next time I have to be more careful,' he thought while his hands and feet were moving gracefully in a coordinated fashion.After three years of daily practice he didn't need to consciously think about moving his body anymore while practicing the set of martial arts. It had become an instinct.But after practicing for so long, he also had started to notice some obvious shortcoming of his practice.At first when he optimized the set of exercises he mainly focused on shaping his body to have more stamina, flexibility and speed. It was oriented toward dodging and escaping rather than attack.As a result he lacked a proper means of combat.It wasn't that having high stamina and flexibility wouldn't help him attacking his opponents but there was a huge difference between having only speed and having both speed and a proper combat tactics. Because its quite impossible to make decisions for every attack you do with conscious mind as it would make your movements slower and predictable.So he decided to compile and optimize a set of melee combat tactics which also included the use of dagger.Fortunately he had accumulated huge amount of data in the library of the system.It took only half an hour to deduce and optimize the melee combat tactics."Kent, freshen up. Breakfast is ready," suddenly his mother's voice sounded from inside the house.'Mom's already awake?' Kent questioned himself before he realisedâ€“"Oops I forgot, I woke up late today," muttered Kent tapping his forehead."Okay mom," replied Kent loudly.After a short discussion during breakfast it was decided that Mr. Granger would be going to the clinic while Mrs. Granger would be staying at home.Although Hermione's fever had gone down and she was in normal condition but still Mrs. Granger insisted on staying home, just to be sure.Hermione and his mother was sitting on the sofa and watching the television when suddenly Hermione stood up."Mom, I'm going upstairs to Kent's room," informed Hermione.She was still anxious about yesterday's matter, how did Kent know about 'Harry Potter'?'Did I talk while sleeping?' Hermione thought as she hurried upstairs."Don't run on the stairs," chided Mrs. Granger."Okay mom," Hermione was already on the 1st floor by the time she slowed down.Kent just finished the practice of visualisation of the pattern when he heard a knock on the door.He looked at clock sitting the desk beside his bed and noted down the time. After three hours, he would have to practice again.He opened the door to see that Hermione was standing there."Why was your door locked?" asked Hermione as her eyes roamed around the room looking for clues to what Kent was doing.She was disappointed that she couldn't find anything worth noting."I was just meditating," chuckled Kent looking at Hermione's behaviour."Do you want to become a monk or something?" asked Hermione jokingly."Who knows?""Well, let's get down to business," said Kent seriously as he took out a pile of paper from the drawer of the desk.Placing the pile of paper on the bed, Kent asked, "You want to know how I know the name 'Harry Potter', right?"Hermione nodded and sat on the bed, looking curious at the papers placed on the bed. They looked like parchment paper.Kent dragged the chair to the side of the bed where he put papers and sat on it."But before that," Kent took a deep breath and asked,"Do you think magic exists?""What?!"Hermione was taken aback by the sudden question."How did youâ€“""Guess, right?" Kent handed her the top most paper from the pile. There was a realistic drawing of a series of boats with four kids each floating towards a magnificent castle illuminated with lamps, under the night sky."Where did you get picture?" asked Hermione staring intently at the drawing.'Looks like she recognised it,' Kent guessed looking at the subtle changes in Hermione's expression.Kent had drawn the pictures yesterday night just to check whether Hermione had clear memories or visions of the future or just some occasional visions. As for Hermione being from future, he was not very sure. Kent had observed her for the last three months but couldn't find anything that would indicate that she was from future."I drew it," chuckled Kent and handed over the rest of the drawings, "also look at these."Hermione took the parchments. Putting the rest back on her side, she unfolded the one at the top. It was a considerably small compared to the others.Unfolding the paper, she saw the sketch of a huge man in shabby clothes holding an equally large umbrella. Most of his face was covered in beard which reached down to his belly."Hagrid," she whispered subconsciously tracing the drawing with her index finger. She didn't notice that Kent was looking at her closely.Her whisper only solidified Kent's guess that Hermione not only dreamt of future but also she could recall the content of the dream.Putting aside the picture of Hagrid, she picked up the next one.Looking at the sketch of a classroom, she frowned. It was of a classroom where students dressed in robes were paired together and there were cauldrons placed in front of them. A man with long hair was standing in front of them holding a short stick. Kent had perfectly portrayed the professor's serious and gloomy expression.Hermione looked a bit uncomfortable when looking at the man. This time she didn't whisper anything but looking at her expression Kent knew that she recognised the man.She soon moved on to next picture. One by one she picked up the drawings and watched them silently.Finished looking at the pictures, Hermione took a deep breath and said one word, "How do you know?""Hermione, in the beginning I asked you that if you believed that magic exists, right?"Hermione nodded."I also believe magic exists and I also believe that we both have magic powers.""Butâ€“""Don't be in a hurry do deny it." Kent interrupted her and continued speaking."You remember that in our fifth birthday when cousin Sally teased you about your front teeth and suddenly a book was flung from the shelf toward her,"Looking straight to her eyes Kent asked, "What do you think, caused the phenomenon?"Clearly remembering the incident, Hermione was stumped by Kent's questions."But, It could be wind orâ€“""Do you really think that wind would have such an accuracy that it only flung the book without disturbing other things and most of all there wasn't even strong wind or storm at that time." argued Kent."Okay, let's just say that the incident was a coincidence but what about our dream.""Yes, I also had dreams about the castle and the classrooms and many more," Kent admitted. Looking at her unbelievable expression, he argued, "How do you think I drew those pictures?"There was a brief silence. Kent sighed and stood up."You probably heard about fortune telling, right?" Kent went to desk and picked up a book on metascience on Divination and gave it to Hermione."What if, the dreams we had were from future?" Kent voiced his thoughts and without giving Hermione a chance to argue back, he continued to speak."It sounds unbelievable, right? I also didn't believe it at first but there are some places I recognised from the dream. One of them is 'Leaky cauldron'. It's a shabby pub on the Charing Cross road. I also visited the place and saw the same kind of people with robes and wands. I even saw them levitating objects," explained Kent although the last part was a lie. He didn't see someone levitating objects. He just made that up.Hermione's expression brightened up."I think magical people or better call them wizards, they might have magic to turn away any non-magical people that's why we don't hear anything about them and the reason I could see them, I guess that I might be magical as well.""I also think the magical world might be dangerous," Kent took out some other papers that were in his pockets and unfolded them one by one.There were drawings of huge snake, a huge creature with a small head carrying a big club, three headed dogs, giant spider."Basilisk, Trolls, Cerberus, Acromantula. I have seen them in my dreams. The Basilisk can kill a person withâ€“"Interrupting Kent in the middle of his talk Hermione explained the rest of it, "â€“its eyes and if a person looks at them through a reflection they become petrified,""And according to what I remember from my dreams, I was petrified by looking at its through a mirror." confessed Hermione.'I might be wrong about her. She knows more than I thought. Did she get memories from the future without affecting her personality?' thought Kent confused by the contradictory fact that Hermione's personality remained the same even with rather complete memories from the future.'Or her personality is same as that of the future? My impression of her may be biased due to my previous life's memorieâ€“'"What happened?" Hermione' s voice woke him from his thoughts."Yes, as I was saying, the magical world is dangerous. So it's better not to venture into the world without sufficient protection." Kent voiced his thoughts."Yes, I know. I had a nightmare yesterday about the man with pale sickly complexion. He called himself V-Voldemort. H-he ki-killedâ€“"Hermione started panicking."Hermione! calm down. That could really just be nightmare," said Kent snapping her out of panicked state.Hermione quickly composed herself."Okay, now that you are calm. Let's talk about the future,""If what we saw in our dreams are accurate then we better prepare ourselves for the worst and I think its better not to inform our parents about this. They might not believe us or even if they did, what we saw was not something our parent can handle," suggested Kent."Hmm," nodded Hermione agreeing with Kent.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

After another few minutes of discussion with Kent, Hermione came out.Without looking back she ran to her room and shut the door tightly.She couldn't hold it in anymore.Inside the familiar walls of her room, she finally let go of her pretence.Kent would be surprised seeing her like this. He wouldn't have thought that occlumency was more than just protecting your mind from legilimency.Thinking about the future, Hermione's expression turned sad and nostalgic. It looked like she had gone through countless vicissitudes of life. Her eyes gradually moistened with drops of tears rolling down her cheeks.It was hard, even for a highly skilled occlumens like her. Keeping her real self under the vineer of a childish personality was harder than she anticipated, especially after seeing those familiar faces, remembering the joyous times, the sad times and mostly the last two years of her life in the future. She along with Harry were under the constant hunt of the dark lord's underlings before she died under the curse of the said dark lord.Hermione was indeed from future. She didn't know how she returned to the past after dying but she was happy that she got a chance to correct the countless mistakes and wrong decisions she made in her life.But there was a single variable in all this. It was her brother.Kent Granger didn't exist in the future. As far as she could recall she was the single daughter of her parents.It didn't just end there. Kent was far mysterious than she thought at first.First of all, he was far more intelligent and mature than what a kid of his age should be even if he was a genius. Maturity and knowledge just don't come out of nowhere. It comes with experience.Kent was also more confident and sure of himself which is generally seen in adults.She had a guess that Kent might be same as her, that is, adult consciousness inside a child's body.Her suspicion deepened after their fifth birthday.He had came up with a set of martial arts which "could" shape the body to it's fullest "potential". She didn't take it seriously at first but as an excuse to observe him more closely, she decided to accept Kent's offer and exercise with him. He even came up with a nutrition drink, although it tasted bad but it was better than those potions she drank in her Hogwarts years.But within a week, she got an unexpected surprise. The combination of the exercise and the nutrition drink worked like a charm. She could literally feel the changes it brought to her body. Although it might not be as instantaneous as those potions but it felt more natural.And within one year, her physic changed from a normal girl to an athlete's or even better.This also deepened the mystery of her brother.Sometimes she was tempted to use legilimency on him but her moral integrity stopped her from doing so. Although during the war against Voldemort, she had picked up the rudimentary legilimency skill but it was rough and rude. It wasn't as subtle as of those highly skilled like Dumbledore.And more importantly, Kent wasn't her enemy.She never felt threatened living with Kent under same roof. Instead she felt a little safer and she tended to believe her intuition more than her eyes, the war had demanded so. When friends as close as your brother abondon you and betrays you for comforts of life, you've got to develop some skills.But she wasn't sure if he knew about magic though.But her doubt was soon cleared one year after her fifth birthday when Kent suddenly started practicing the same martial arts but with a short stick in his hand.She had watched him carefully during the practice and noticed his graceful manipulation of the stick with his fingers.It was also one of the reason Hermione staged such a scene yesterday about her nightmare. Accidentally revealing the name 'Harry' in front of Kent.Another reason was, she wanted to know if Kent was indeed from the future.Today's incident confirmed her guess.He was indeed from the future. She didn't believe any of his "visions seen in dreams" excuses. The portrait of Hagrid, the drawings of Hogwarts castle, potion classroom. Even the gloomy expression on Snape's face was spot on.Divination was much more complicated and vague than that. As far she knew all the prophecies were vague.She had to admit that her brother's drawing skills were superb.'It makes things easier and also a lot more complicated than before,' Hermione sighed.Easier in the sense that Kent's biological age was same as her and mentally he was also an adult like her. She could at least relate to someone in her age group, be it her brother.And it was harder in the sense that she wasn't sure if they were the only ones who came back from the future. And also which future did Kent come from? The parallel universe theories are pretty complicated.Putting away the distracting thoughts, Hermione pondered, 'maybe I should teach him occlumency.'But she immediately scrapped that idea.'No! I need to observe him more,'It was not that she suspected Kent was an enemy but on careful thought, she found that she didn't know him as well as she believed.She was also sure that he hid many things from her just like she hid many things from him.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

The last six months were hard for Kent. It was mainly because of the practice of visualisation.He had clearly underestimated the difficulties. He couldn't always carry an alarm clock with him, could he? Like in class. It was also difficult to wake up in the middle of the night to practice. He hadn't had a proper sleep in the last six months.He was reprimanded by his teacher more than once for being distracted during the class.It was also tiring to practice it every three hours. He found that although he followed the instructions as best as he could, he still felt tired at the end of the day. This also increased his calories intake. He even drank the nutrition mix more than once a day. Fortunately his parents were dentists. It would be difficult for a normal family to bear the cost.In the end, his hard work had paid off. After the first three months of struggle, he immediately felt the changes. His perception of the surroundings had subtly changed. He noticed many small and insignificant things that he would usually ignore.The knowledge of psychology and his enhanced observations complemented each other. He could more or less predict what a ordinary person's gonna do in the next moment. It was a magical feeling.Also after the first three months of practice, he had basically grasped the schedule.He no longer needed to close his eyes to visualise and concentrate and he also could wake up on time to practice, during the night.This also increased the efficiency of his practice and it only took another three months to partially master the danger sense skill.Whenever there was a danger, he would feel a slight stinging sensation and immediately know the direction it was coming from. It was pretty similar to the 'spider sense' of spiderman.The only shortcoming was that he had to stay vigilant for his danger sense skill to work. That's why he believed that he hadn't completely mastered the skill as said in the manual â€“ only after making it an Instinct the skill could be considered mastered. He was confident that he would be able to do so within a year."Stare at this pattern for a minute," Kent said to Hermione, showing her a pattern drawn on a piece of squared parchment.It was exactly the same pattern which Kent had practiced visualisation for the past six months. After mastering the skill, he found that he could visualise portions of the pattern separately. That gave him the idea of drawing it on a parchment and then show it to Hermione and see if it works or not.At first he was reluctant to share it with Hermione but after the incident involving her nightmare, they became very close, occasionally sharing things about the future they "saw" in their "dreams".After considering the future troubles, Kent felt it was silly and impractical to shoulder all the responsibilities alone when you have a smart sister who knows about the future.So Kent decided to share it with Hermione. The skill, if Hermione could master, would become a vital part of their fighting strength against the "dark lord".His art skills, which he had to spend countless hour in the simulation space to master, had helped him in his endeavour.There were few differences though, between the pattern on the paper and what he had in his memory.It was really impossible to copy the intricate pattern to the minute details. But he found it was pretty effective after testing it. He just wanted to know if it would work on Hermione.Hermione looked at pattern and asked, "what is this?"She was puzzled looking at the gibberish pattern which made no sense to her."Don't be distracted, just look at the whole pattern and try to concentrate on it as much as possible," said Kent.Seeing Hermione's hesitation, Kent persuaded, "just try it, you will be surprised.""Okay, if you say so," Hermione finally agreed.After only few seconds of staring at the pattern she went into a trance.'So, it also works on others,' thought Kent looking at Hermione who was standing in a daze looking toward the pattern on the parchment which was stuck on the wall.'It's almost three minutes,' He looked at the clock and decided to wake her up."Hermione, Hermione," Kent shook her shoulders.Hermione woke up from her trance with a gasp as if she was deprived of air."Are you okay?" asked Kent with concern.Adjusting her breathing, Hermione exclaimed out loud, "what just happened?!""After looking at the pattern, you went into a trance for three minutes straight," replied Kent as he sat down on his bed and continued, "no worries, I was also in a trance when I tried it for the first time,"Without waiting for her to speak, Kent asked, "Do you remember the feeling when you were in a trance?"The question made Hermione thoughtful. Thinking quietly for a moment, she answered, "I can't quite accurately describe it but it felt like I was going to comprehend something. It-it was like... when you read the first few sentence of an essay and think that you understand what's the whole essay is about but the next few sentences make you realise that you didn't actually understand anything. This process goes on. It was so frustrating!""Good analogy," Kent nodded thoughtfully."What is that pattern?" asked Hermione."I don't know myself," admitted Kent truthfully. He really didn't know. It was the system that deduced and optimised the pattern from lots of information collected over an year by him. It would take a lot of timeâ€“ which he didn't have, to search through the library of the system to find the source."Where did you get it?" asked Hermione."Well, let's just say, lots of knowledge and a powerful mind." Kent gave her a vague answer."Okay, putting away the unimportant questions," said Kent not caring if Hermione was dissatisfied. The system was his biggest secret which he didn't want anyone other than himself to know about."You see if you visualise that pattern for five minutes in the interval of three hours, you would develop a skill which will help you sense danger in advance," explained Kent concisely.Looking at her expression, Kent laughed and asked, "You don't believe me?"Hermione nodded frankly. Although the pattern was quite mysterious but it was still unbelievable to think just by visualising the said pattern, one would develop the skill to sense danger."Flying brooms, dragons, unicorn, talking portrait and magic itself is an impossible thing but they still exist, so why can't the fact that the piece of pattern on the parchment can help develop a intuitive sense of danger be possible," argued Kent.Kent then suddenly thought of something and looked under his bed."You may not believe my words but you have to believe your eyes" said Kent suddenly as he pulled out a plastic bag containing three tennis balls."Lets go to the backyard.""Tennis balls? What do you want to do with tennis balls?" asked Hermione on the way."You'll see," said Kent as they soon reached the backyard of their house."Okay, you hold this for a sec," Kent handed over the plastic bag to Hermione.He walked to the centre of the yard.Then he took out a piece of black cloth and covered his eyes with it."Hermione, throw the tennis balls toward me. Aim for my chest or head, wherever you want. Just throw with the intention of hurting me," Kent instructed."Did he really mastered the danger sense skill?" Hermione muttered. She finally understood what Kent wanted to do but she was still skeptical whether Kent's words were true.'Whatever, let's see if Kent can really dodge the balls while blindfolded,' Hermione took out one of the tennis ball from bag and put rest back to the ground."Here I come," Hermione threw the first ball aiming for Kent's shoulder. As she was standing really close to Kent, about ten meters away, the aim was pretty correct.The ball went straight toward Kent's right shoulder.But when it was just about one foot away from Kent, he jumped sideways to his left. The ball hit the fence on the back missing him completely.'It must be a fluke. He probably heard my voice and dodged the ball,' Hermione concluded and to prove herself right, she picked the next ball quietly and walked sideways to her left. Aiming for Kents abdomen, she threw the ball. This time, the ball was faster.But the result was the same. Kent dodged the ball at last moment by jumping sideways to his right.She was still not reconciled.Picking up the last ball, she threw it with all her strength."Oops," She gasped as soon as the ball left her hand. Due to her using full strength, the aim was a bit off. She wanted to aim for his shoulder but the ball went straight toward his face.But similar to the first two tries, Kent dodged the ball in the last moment just by ducking his head."You must be cheating," Hermione ran toward Kent to check whether he had properly covered his eyes. Even after seeing the cloth tightly wrapped around his eyes Hermione remained skeptical."This time I will tie it around your eyes. Let's see if you can still dodge," said Hermione as she untied the blindfold."Okay, whatever you wish," Kent laughed. He was having fun seeing Hermione so frustrated and flustered.After making sure the blindfold wasn't transparent, Hermione tied the blindfold back around his eyes. She even made sure that it covered both of his eyes completely."Are you happy now?" Kent sighed helplessly."Let's see if you can laugh after this time," Hermione said as she picked up the three balls and went back to her position.The first ball went straight toward his leg, Kent jumped and dodged it. The second one went straight towards his lower abdomen, Kent turned ninety-degrees to his right allowing it to pass and missing him completely.The last one was difficult. Hermione walked forward quietly until she was only a few meters away from Kent. She threw the ball fast and hard straight toward the middle of his chest. The aim was perfect this time. Kent responded to this one a bit differently. He caught the ball with his right hand while his left hand was on the back.Throwing the ball back to Hermione, Kent untied the blindfold and asked, "So, how was it? Still don't believe?""Can you sense any kind of danger? Like... like if someone is in front of you and pretending to be all friendly but he actually want to harm you. Can you detect the danger?" Hermione couldn't help but ask."I haven't tried it but it should work. If you can master the skill, you will feel a slight stinging sensation when you are in danger and also know the direction its coming from." answered Kent expressing his thoughts.It had only been a few days that Kent had mastered the danger sense skill. He still hadn't have the time to experiment with it properly.AN: Do you mind giving me reviews?An extra like, maybe?A follow, maybe?

When Kent decided to share the pattern with Hermione, he didn't expect anything in return. He just wanted a capable ally against the future enemies.But who knew Hermione would offer something that he was in dire need of before going to Hogwarts.It's Occlumency.Kent had been worried that his secrets might be exposed if someone used legilimency on him. To counter the problem, he had compiled a comprehensive method of organising his thoughts and protecting his mind from outside influences, but he was pretty sure that against legilimency it won't be effective.So he really wanted to learn Occlumency. But even if he ventured into magical world, it was doubtful if he could get books or instructions on Occlumency. It was pretty obscure and valuable knowledge.Hermione solved the problem.After seeing the effectiveness of the danger sense skill, Hermione felt a little guilty about hesitating to teach Occlumency to Kent.From Hermione's perspective, the danger sense skill was equally valuable as the Occlumency skill."Here, I have written all the steps and instructions I remember about Occlumency practice," Hermione handed over a notebook, half-an-inches thick, to Kent. She was sure that after today, Kent would probably suspect that she's from the future. But still Hermione didn't hesitate because, like Kent, Hermione was also investing on a future ally.Opening the notebook, Kent skimmed over the content and he was baffled by it.'How much does she remember?!' exclaimed Kent in his thoughts. Considering the thickness of the notebook, Hermione had probably written over a hundred pages of content."Ah, I almost forgot," Kent suddenly remembered something and said, "okay, wait here for a moment,"He ran out of the room in a hurry.When he came back to Hermione's room, he had a small bracelet with him.He showed the bracelet to Hermione. It was a plain bracelet with a small red button on the top.He clicked on the button and a small squared card slid out from the side of the bracelet. It contained the pattern that Kent showed her earlier. To make visualisation more convenient for Hermione, Kent had carefully drawn the pattern on the small card and constructed a bracelet with sliding mechanism to put it inside.He then put the card back into the bracelet and handed the bracelet to Hermione."Remember, it is dangerous to visualise the pattern for more than five minutes. So be careful." Kent warned her about the danger of visualising the pattern. He had experienced the danger himself when he first tried it."It would be better if you do it in my presence for the first few days," Kent offered to help."Okay," Hermione agreed without hesitation. She was well aware of the danger. If Kent hadn't woke her up during her first try, she might not be able to wake from the trance.Days went by as Hermione started to notice the changes brought about by visualisation of the pattern.After the first few months of visualising under the supervision of Kent, she found that she could recall the pattern in her mind and it was as effective as the one drawn on the card.This also made the practice more convenient and easy.The only problem was that her progress was a bit slow.It wasn't that she wasn't deligent enough.The problem stemmed from the imperfections of the pattern drawn by Kent.That didn't make her lose confidence though, because however small the improvement was, it was happening. She had become more observant. She had started to notice things she usually ignore especially as a witch.Her perception of magic had improved ever so slightly and it was still improving.Kent wasn't idle either during the time.After getting the step by step instructions on Occlumency from Hermione, Kent had read the whole notebook.The process of practicing Occlumency was not much different from the meditation guide he had compiled using the system. The difference was that Occlumency required the person to make his or her mind blank and empty, devoid of emotions. It sounds easy but practicing the discipline required great control over one's emotion.He modified the meditation guide he had been following for the last five years. He just chose all the information related to meditation and also included the content of the notebook that Hermione gave him.He specified the main function as being able to repel any kind of mental intrusion.It took about three days for the system to deduce and optimize the guide. He named it 'Guide to Occlumency'. He memorised the whole manual using the download function of the library.Practicing Occlumency was harder than the visualisation process. It was boring and monotonous.But the changes it brought kept him going on. He was a lot calmer. It also brought positive changes to his other practices.He was hopeful that after mastering Occlumency he would be less prone to panic when faced with unexpected situations.The process of Visualisation had also become a lot more effective.It was a chilly, Sunday morning.Two teenagers were sitting on the sofa, a boy and a girl.Looking at them, it felt like looking at two scholars, refined and disciplined.The boy was Kent Granger and the girl was Hermione Granger.It was difficult to recognize the girl as she had straightened her distinctively bushy hairs.They would occasionally glance outside the window overlooking the front yard as if waiting for someone.Today was a special day for both of them. It was 19 September 1990, their 11th birthday and also the day they would probably receive their Hogwart's acceptance letter.They didn't have to wait long as they soon saw a middle aged woman walking toward the door. She was wearing emerald green robes and a black pointed hat with feathers stuck in the brim.

Minerva McGonagall was the deputy headmistress of Hogwarts, Head of Gryffindor House and also the professor who taught transfiguration.But despite having all those high positions and the corresponding responsibilities, she would always make time every year for the special occasion, that is, introducing muggleborn witches or wizards to magical world.She tries her best to make it as comfortable as she could, for the muggle family to accept magic and send their child to Hogwarts.She was pretty surprised this morning, when she looked up the Hogwart's directory where the name and address of the wizards and witches who are eligible to attend Hogwarts, were recorded.It was quite rare for muggle household to have two magical children at the same time.It was at 9 o'clock when she reached the Granger residence.Ringing the doorbell twice, she waited."Kent, look who's at the door," came a female voice from the house."Okay mom," answered a boy.Soon she heard a pair of footsteps.A brown haired boy opened the door."Who are you?" the boy asked."I am Minerva McGonagall, a professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry," she introduced herself.Looking at the puzzle expression of the boy, she chuckled and said, "it'd be better if you call you parents.""So, you are saying that magic is real and both of my children are magical," asked Mrs. Granger with an unbelievable expression."Madam, I think you need to see a doctor," remarked Mr. Granger in the middle."Dan, don't be rude," Mrs. Granger sternly warned Mr. Granger."It's alright," Professor McGonagall smiled. She was not offended by Mr. Granger's rude words. She deals with similar things every year."A demonstration would dispel your doubts, I hope?" offered professor McGonagall."If you can, that is," rebuked Mr. Granger.Professor McGonagall waved the wand in her right hand and tapped twice on the tea cup sitting on the table. The moment the tip of the wand touched the cup for the second time, it changed into a breathing, living bird.The Granger couple were shocked seeing the tea cup turned into bird. The whole thing happened in front of their eyes leaving them no chance to rebute her claim.On the side, Kent was looking curiously at professor's demonstration. It was the first time he had seen magic right in front of him. He had already activated the record function of the system library. As said in the introductions, the system records informations in any form, be it pictorial or written.After introducing the Granger family to the wonders of the magical world and informing them of the advantages of magical education, the professor produced two envelopes from her robes and handed them to Mrs. Granger."There is a list of all necessary books and equipment inside the envelope along with the letter," added the professor."You don't have to decide immediately." reminded professor McGonagall seeing the parent's hesitation and continued, "but I hope that you will allow your children to attend Hogwarts as it can be very dangerous for your children if they don't learn to control their magic powers.""There will be a post owl waiting for your reply," she reminded them.After coming out of the house, professor McGonagall dissappeared as if squeezed into nothingness.It didn't take long for the Granger couple to reach a decision.After a bit of thinking and discussion, considering the danger of not learning how to control magical powers, it was decided that Kent and Hermione would attend Hogwarts.After getting the positive response from the Granger family, professor herself decided to be their guide to buy required books and equipment in Diagon Alley.It was 11 o'clock when professor McGonagall picked them up. They travelled to the Charing Cross road using non-magical transport as she knew that it would be uncomfortable for the Granger family to travel using "Apparition" â€“ a rather convenient magical teleportation skill."This is one of oldest pub in London, 'The Leaky Cauldron'. It is also the entrance to Diagon Alley where we are going to buy the supplies," Professor McGonagall opened the worn out grey door sandwiched between a book shop and a record store. It was situated in such conspicuous place but most people walking by didn't even glance at it.The Granger family followed her in.The moment they stepped in, they felt the change in atmosphere. It was like they travelled back to Victorian age. The pub was a bit dingy and dark. It was dimly lit with candles. Their presence didn't cause any changes in the lively atmosphere of the pub."Hello Professor McGonagall. Hogwart's students?" asked the bartender politely sizing up the two teens following behind the professor."Yes Tom," said the professor with stern face. There was a significant change in her attitude from when she talked with Granger family.Soon they followed the professor into a chilly courtyard surrounded by brick wall.The wall on the front had a few bricks missing from the centre.'It was made purposefully,' Kent concluded looking at the groove.Professor McGonagall took out her wand and tapped on the bricks around the groove in sequence.Kent memorised the position of the bricks as well as the sequence of the tapping.Soon on the fifth tap, the bricks started rearranging itself.The professor stepped back.The bricks pulled away by itself forming an archway leading to a street bursting with people wearing long hats and robes.If entering the pub was like traveling back in time to the Victorian age then entering Diagon Alley was like stepping into a whole new world.Kent deeply wished at the time that he was taller. The streets were so densely packed that it was very difficult for him to see the shops. He could only see the top of buildings that were slightly tilted toward the street."We will first go to Gringotts to change the muggle money to wizarding currency," said professor McGonagall."What is Gringotts, professor? Is it a Bank?" asked Kent."Yes it is the largest bank in wizarding world. It is run by goblins," answered professor McGonagall."Stay close to me," said the professor looking at the overcrowded street.On the way to the Gringotts bank, Kent would occasionally glance around him as if looking for something.'Looks like she can't feel it,' thought Kent as he took a glance at Hermione.From the moment he had entered Diagon Alley, he could feel a slight stinging sensation throughout his body. He knew that it was his danger sense that was warning him. Although it was very faint but still dangerous.So he would occasionally glance back or sideways to determine the source.Instead of finding out the source, he found a pretty significant flaw of his danger sense skill. It was very difficult to find the source of danger in an overcrowded area."Hermione, I felt slight danger a few seconds ago," Kent whispered to Hermione.Her muscle tightened on hearing Kent's words."I think what I sensed was hostility. But its better to be careful though," added Kent.Hermione nodded. If it was really dangerous she would've also felt it. Her sense were less sensitive or it would be better to say that Kent's senses were too sharp.'Looks like we reached the bank,' thought Kent as his eyes fell on a very tall white building with "GRINGOTTS BANK" written in bold letters on the front balcony structure.The whole building was made of white jade stone. The design was a bit trippy though, not that it was ugly but the whole building was asymmetrical.They entered the bank through a burnished bronze door followed by small entrance hall and another set of doors made of silver."Enter, stranger, but take heedOf what awaits the sin of greed,For those who take, but do not earn,Must pay most dearly in their turn.So if you seek beneath our floorsA treasure that was never yours,Thief, you have been warned, bewareOf finding more than treasure there, "Kent read the warning engraved on the silver door."It is the safest place in the world for safekeeping your money and valuables, expect for Hogwarts, that is," said Professor McGonagall with pride. It was difficult to discern whether she was proud of Gringotts or Hogwarts or it was both.Passing through the door, they reached marble Hall.'They don't look much different from what I had in my mind,' Kent thought seeing the hundred or so Goblins sitting at the counters. They were short with pointed beard and equally pointed nose and ears. Their fingers and feet were very long.After changing few thousand pounds to galleons, they followed professor McGonagall to Madam Malkin's to buy robes and hats for Kent and Hermione.It took a bit of time to fit them for their robes separately. After that they went straight to Flourish and Blotts bookstore located next to Madam Malkin's shop.The inside of bookstore was bigger compared to what they saw from outside.It was filled with shelves stacked to the ceiling.Looking at so many books, Kent had a urge to just record each and every book using the system library. Unfortunately, It was not the right time and the manager probably wouldn't allow him.They bought only one copy of each book in the list that was included in the envelope alongside the Hogwarts letter.Kent and Hermione had suggested that it would be wasteful to buy same books for them separately as they could just share it. The professor also supported the decision.Except for the Hogwarts textbooks, they also bought some other books which included books about the history of magical world like the one titled "Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century" and "The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts", a book on potion making and the theory behind it and also an encyclopedia about different magical plants and fungi.As it was not allowed for them to practice magic in "muggle world" except for special cases, so Kent decided that in the remaining time before they attended Hogwarts, he would make full use of the system and learn the "subtle art of making potions" as Snape would call it and if possible, try to come up with new useful recipes using the optimization function of the system.After buying the other necessary supplies like cauldron and telescope, they headed down the alley to buy wands for Kent and Hermione.Passing by a pet shop, they stopped in front of an old shop with an window display consisting of a single wand resting on a faded purple cushion."Olivander's, Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C," read Kent looking at the words inlaid with gold.The family of four followed the professor into the shop. There was a chime of the bell when the professor opened the door.The shop was quiet and had a dusty feeling to it.There were thousands of narrow boxes piled right up to the ceiling.'Do all of them contain Wands or they were just for show?' Kent wondered."Minerva McGonagall, nine and a half inch, Fir, dragon heartstring. Buying wand for new students?" said an old man who appeared from behind a shelf stacked with boxes containing wands."Yes Mr. Ollivander," she said and pointed toward the two teens standing beside her, "Mr and Ms. Granger will be buying their wands,""Ah, first generation, I see. eh?" Mr. Olivander suddenly felt something and looked back."Oh my! Is it...?" muttered Mr. Ollivander as he hurried to the room at back of the store.The family of four was shocked at his odd behaviour, professor McGonagall wasn't an exception. It was first time she had seen Mr. Ollivander so excited and she had visited the shop many times as a guide to muggleborn witches and wizards."I'll be! It is the third time, I am observating this phenomenon in my shop!" Mr. Ollivanders came out from the room with a cream coloured box in his hand. The box was occasionally producing sparks of red and gold."What happened, Mr. Ollivander?" Kent asked Mr. Olivander looking curiously at the oddly sparkling box."Vine wands do tend to produce magical effect in presence of a suitable owner and I think I just know who it is," said Mr. Ollivander looking at Hermione who was looking at the box in a daze.He opened the box, took out a yellowish wand about ten inch long and handed it to Hermione.The moment Hermione hold the wand, it produced a final bright spark of red before returning to normal."Quite a strong reaction," Mr. Ollivander looked curiously at Hermione before he turned his attention to Kent."Which one's your dominant hand?" asked Mr. Ollivander."Right. I am right handed, sir," answered Kent.Mr. Ollivander produced a measuring tape from his pocket and took a rough measurement of Kent's right hand."Ah, I know just the right wand for you," said Mr. Ollivander as he walked back to shelves.Soon he came back with a black box in his hand."Ten and a half inch made of Ebony wood with dragon heartstrings as it's core," He handed a dark brown coloured wand to Kent.There was no special effect whatsoever when Kent held the wand. He also didn't feel anything different."Give it a wave," instructed Mr. Ollivander.Kent did so aiming toward the shelves on the front."Hmm...?" Kent felt a familiar sensation passing through his spine towards his right hand the moment he waved the wand.But soon he was snapped out of his stupor both by his mother's voice and the sound of boxes falling on the ground."Be careful, Kent!" Mrs. Granger scolded her son and ordered him to apologise to the shopkeeper for making a mess."I am very sorry, Mr. Ollivander," apologised Kent sincerely and put the wand on the counter."No worries. This happens all the time and they are just a spell away from being sorted into the right place," said Mr. Ollivander light and flicked his original wand toward the fallen boxes. In the next moment the boxes flew back to the shelf and sorted themselves into their original places."Not the right wand, I suppose," Mr. Ollivander put the wand back to the box and went back to the shelves.Soon he came out of the passage between two shelves on the right hand side. He had four boxes in his hand.Kent tried them one by one but found no suitable match."Quite the tricky customer. Let's try a tricky wand then," muttered Mr. Ollivander as he went to room at the back of shop.While Mr. Ollivander was busy picking the right wand, Kent was reminiscing about the sensation he felt when he was trying out the previous wands.It took a bit of time for Mr. Ollivander to come out. This time he had only one box in his hand."This one's a unique wand with an unusual combination. I had tried making a second one only to end in a failure," Mr. Ollivander explained the story behind the wand."Why so, Mr. Ollivander?" asked Kent looking curiously at the yellowish wand."Cedar wood known for choosing owner with strong characters and loyalty never tend to mix with feathers from phoenix known for its detached and aloof temperament. It was by an experimental accident that I was able to make the wand," explained Mr. Ollivander and handed the nine and half inch long wand to Kent.The moment he touched the wand, Kent knew he had found the right wand. It was like the last piece of puzzle settled into the right position and he became whole. The feeling was very magical.From the side, they saw Kent glowing faintly with red which subsided on the next second."Very good, I expected great things from both of you," said Mr. Ollivander.Paying the 14 galleons for the Wands, the family came out of the shop.After escorting the Granger family out of the Leaky Cauldron, professor McGonagall disappeared.The Granger family took a bus and returned home. On the way back, Kent and Hermione remained vigilant.Kent's danger sense was triggered quite a few times while shopping in Diagon Alley.They were not sure if the hostile party or parties would follow them back. So just to be safe, they were ready to fight in a moment's notice.AN: Where's my review?

"Take care of your sister, Son," said Mr. Granger giving a pat on Kent's shoulder.They were standing on a platform packed with people, next to a scarlet steam engine.The atmosphere was lively with some students saying goodbye to their family, some fighting for the seat near the window."I will, dad," said Kent firmly.Their conversation was cut off by the whistle of the steam engine.Hermione who was standing in front of the door of an empty compartment with both of their trunks, looked back and urged Kent to come quickly."Goodbye, Dad" said Kent as he ran off to join Hermione.Taking a last glance at their dad, they lifted their luggage onto the train through the small door, albeit a little difficulty.Tucking their trunks separately in a corner of the compartment, they sat down next to the window opposite to each other.With a whistle the train began to move. They waved at their dad who soon disappeared from view as the train picked up the speed.Kent leaned against the seat comfortably while fiddling with the wand. The wand was moving smoothly between his fingers as if there was an extra limb which was manipulating it.After getting his own wand, it had become a habit of playing with it whenever he felt bored."Just stop playing with it, will you," said Hermione angrily closing the thick book in her hand."Sorry," Kent stopped playing with the wand but didn't put it away."So, what do you think we should do? About Neville, I mean do you wanna help him find his toad? What was it's name again?" asked Kent."Trevor." reminded Hermione. The little toad had a significant role in her life. Through it, she met two of her best friend on the train in her "first try at life" as she likes to call it."Ah yes, Trevor. So what do you want to do?" asked Kent. He never liked to impose his plan on others, if not absolutely necessary.And Hermione was an adult, she could decide for herself. He could suggest but that's all."I don't know. I don't want to change everything, you know. I miss them. I miss my friends. I wish our friendship could be back to the way it was in the future." answered Hermione with melancholy."I dare not say that I can understand what you're feeling. I never had gone through a war much less had friends on whom I could depend with my life. But if you really want my advice then I would suggest, take it slow. Observe and interact with them, see where it leads," suggested Kent."I know. I really want to. It's just I'm afraid, I'm afraid to face them knowing that they are not and can never be the same person I once knew," said Hermione expressing her fear.The compartment fell into a strange silence.Knock!The silence was broken by a knock on the door. They saw a round-faced boy standing outside."Speak of the devil," muttered Kent."Come in," said Kent politely."I'm sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad?""No, I'm afraid not," answered Kent. Hearing Kent's words the boy looked as if he was going to cry."How about I help you search for your toad?" Offered Kent. The boy wanted to say something but Kent didn't give him any chance to speak.Standing up and straightening his robe, he said to the boy, "let's go,"He looked back and nodded at Hermione who was trying her best to control her emotions.He wasn't worried about Hermione's safety. He might be stronger and faster than her physically but in terms of magical powers, he was far from being her opponent. She didn't need his protection."I am Kent Granger," introduced Kent while walking through the narrow corridor."I...I am Neville, Neville Longbottom," the round-faced boy stammered shaking Kent's hand nervously."Don't worry we will soon find your toad," Kent reassured Neville with a pat on the shoulder.Kent had another purpose other than helping Neville. It was to explore the compartments and meet new students, see if they look anything similar to what he remembers from the movie.The coach they were in, was pretty long. To search more efficiently, Neville and Kent chose to go in opposite direction of the coach.Kent went toward the back end of the coach. According to what he could recall from the movie, Harry Potter should be in one of the compartments near the end of the train.One by one, he knocked on each compartment and asked the occupants if they had seen Neville's toad. Unfortunately most of them answered "no", some said that they had seen a toad but forgot where they had seen it.After getting "no" as an answer from majority of the students, he wondered, "Did Trevor jump off the train?""Anything off the trolley, dears?"He was snapped out of his thoughts by a female voice.He saw a lady in deep red dress, probably in her forties, standing with a trolley full of candies.He walked forward and saw a black haired boy buying off most of candies from the lady."Is that Harry Potter?" muttered Kent. He couldn't get a proper look at the boy as his back was turned against Kent.After the lady passed by him with her "almost empty" trolley, Kent walked up to the compartment door.The door was already open. Two boys were busy sorting through the candies sprawled all over the seat.He knocked on the frame of the door to get their attention."Have you seen a toad?" Kent asked, "My friend Neville lost it."Kent took a quick glance at the rat sleeping on the lap of the red haired teen before turning his attention toward the bespectacled boy with black hair."No," answered the red haired boy irritably."Thank you," Kent said, "Sorry, by the way."Kent then walked away from the compartment. He had already confirmed what he intended to. Also It would be rude to interrupt their meal.On the way to his compartment he met up with Neville who looked tearful."You should properly check your own compartment. The toad might be in there somewhere," suggested Kent helplessly. It was really difficult to search for a tiny toad in such a vast coach."T-thank you. I will," said Neville in a low voice.When he came back, he saw a bespectacled girl with short brown hair coming out of the compartment Hermione was in.Returning back to his seat, he asked, "Who was she?""Her name is Sally-Anne Perks. She's a first year like us." answered Hermione. Her mood had improved a bit."Sally-Anne, the name doesn't ring any bell." Kent shook his head."She dropped out of Hogwarts after taking her OWLs exam in the future." informed Hermione."Oh,""So, what did you find?" asked Hermione changing the topic."Everything is pretty similar to what we know," answered Kent."Did you see that rat?" asked Hermione with a menacing expression."Yes." Kent said."Was it missing a toe?" Hermione asked again."Probably." Kent wasn't very sure.Getting a stare from Hermione, he justified, "I couldn't get a proper look. They were having a meal!""You know, we can just grab Sirius from Azkaban. It'd save us a lot of time and work," said Kent as if he had a sudden enlightenment."First of all, we don't know the layout of the jail. And also it's impossible to bypass the dementors without alerting the guards," she said seriously, "and most important fact is that we are not powerful enough to just waltz our way into the jail and grab Sirius. Alsoâ€“""Stop stop. I know it's difficult but I am worried whether your plan would work." Kent said, "I mean, some of the 'upright' and politically influential people will not want to see Sirius Black getting a trial. Especially Lucius Malfoy, he always coveted the heritage of Black family.""Malfoy's still not influential enough to manipulate the minister and most importantly Fudge recently became a minister," Hermione argued back."It's also risky to use Rita Skeeter," Kent reminded, "Daily Prophet's probably under those pureblood bigots.""You don't have to worry, I will meet her under disguise." She said,"and also don't forget that she's an unregistered animagus.""By the way, what's your animagus?" Kent asked suddenly."I was getting started in my sixth year but then Dumbledore died and the war escalated. Harry and I were too busy running away from the death eaters to relax and practice. One thing led to another." She said, "I never got the chance,"The compartment fell into an awkward silence again.Kent was embarrassed. He was mentally a decade older than Hermione. He was supposed to be comforting her but didn't know how to."You don't have to feel bad though," Hermione said with a smile, "I am happy that I got a chance to redo everything.""Yes." Kent said, "I am also happy that I got the chance to learn and practice magic.""But first we need get rid of that dark w*nker," added Kent jokingly to lighten up the mood."Language Kent!" Scolded Hermione trying her best to keep a straight face.

It was already dark when the train reached Hogsmeade station.Kent and Hermione got off the train train in the midst of the students pushing their way through the door."Firs' years! Firs' years over here!" They saw a huge man about as tall as the train coming over with a lamp in his hand.'Hagrid's really huge!' Kent looked up at the man with the lamp and wandered, 'Then, what about real giants?'The first year students gathered in front of the Hagrid one by one."All right there, Harry?" asked Hagrid.Harry sleepily nodded. It was a long journey."Any more firs' years? C'mon then, follow me!"The first years followed Hagrid down a steep narrow path. It was really difficult to see on the either side of the path because of the dark."Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here.""Wow!" Kent looked at the vast castle perched over a high mountain on the other side of the lake.Hermione was silent by his side. She had a complicated feeling looking at the familiar castle. It had brought her so much joy but also had ruined her life once."We won't let it happen again," Kent said softly.Hermione nodded, clenching her fist."No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of small boats sitting in the water by the shore. Each boat had a lamp hanging from the wooden post stuck on it.Kent and Hermione got into a boat followed by the girl Sally-Anne Perks and another lively girl with blond hair."Everyone in?" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. "Right then -- FORWARD!"And the fleet of small boats moved off all at once, slowly gliding across the lake.The castle was getting bigger and bigger as they moved closer to the other side.Kent got a clear view on how big and majestic the castle was."Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of vines that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.Kent and Hermione were the only ones who didn't have any difficulties walking on the rocks.They steadily walked through the crowd of students and stopped beside Hagrid who had a little toad in his huge hand.'When did Hagrid got it?' Kent wondered."Trevor!" cried Neville blissfully holding out his hands.Then the students, except for Kent and Hermione who were walking steadily as walking on a flat land, clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door."Everyone here?"Hagrid raised his gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.While everyone was nervous, Kent was quietly looking at door, recording everything in his sight using the system library. There were lots of unknown intricate symbols and inscription on the door. They might come in handy one day.A few moments later, the door swung opened to reveal a familiar face.Kent recognised the black haired witch at first glance. She was Professor McGonagall who "introduced" him and his sister to the magical world and also acted as a guide in Diagon Alley."Firs' years, professor McGonagall," said Hagrid."Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here."She pulled the door wide. The entrance was big, big enough to fit a medium sized house in it. The grey walls were lit with flaming torches. In the front was a marble staircase that led to upper floors.The Granger duo followed behind the professor along with other first years.'The door probably leads to the great hall,' guessed Kent hearing the drone of voices coming from the doorway to the right.The professor led them to a an empty hall and stopped in front of them.The students crowded in, standing rather close to each other. Kent and Hermione stood at the side."Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room."The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours."The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting."Her eyes roamed around the students for a moment."I shall return when we are ready for you," said Professor McGonagall. "Please wait quietly."The hall fell silent. There were bouts of whisper but no one spoke out loud."Are you nervous?" Kent whispered to Hermione."Yes, I am afraid we have to lower our occlumency shield for the hat to sort us." Hermione said, "it uses legilimency.""I don't think the hat remembers what it sees," Kent said. "It must have sorted so many students in the last thousand years. It can't possibly retain everyone's memory, right?""What the â€“ ?!"Their conversation was cut short by a collective gasp from the crowd. The students were staring at a group of pear-white and slightly transparent figures floating and talking with each other.It was their first time seeing ghosts. It was bound to scare them a little.Kent looked at the ghosts curiously wandering if they were real spirits."Move along now," said a sharp voice. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to start."Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall."Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and follow me."Kent and Hermione were the last to join the line, with Kent standing behind Hermione.They followed the professor out of the chamber back across entrance hall, and through a pair of double doors into the great hall.The great hall was lit by the numerous candles that were floating over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students.Kent looked at teachers. He recognised headmaster Dumbledore, who was sitting at the middle of the high table.He also recognised professor Quirrell by his large purple turban, who was fidgeting constantly. He was having a conversation with a greasy haired man sitting beside him."That must be professor Snape." Kent guessed but turned his eyes sideways. From the the corner of his eyes he could see professor Snape looked at him.'Phew! He's too sensitive,' thought Kent as his eyes fell on professor McGonagall.She placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top the stool, she placed a pointed wizards hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty.Kent shivered at the thought putting that dirty hat onto his head.Soon the chattering of the students quieted down with all of them staring at the hat, waiting for something to happen. The hat twitched as if it was coming to life. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,But don't judge on what you see,I'll eat myself if you can findA smarter hat than me.You can keep your bowlers black,Your top hats sleek and tall,For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting HatAnd I can cap them all.There's nothing hidden in your headThe Sorting Hat can't see,So try me on and I will tell youWhere you ought to be.You might belong in Gryffindor,Where dwell the brave at heart,Their daring, nerve, and chivalrySet Gryffindors apart;You might belong in Hufflepuff,Where they are just and loyal,Those patient Hufflepuffs are trueAnd unafraid of toil;Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind,Where those of wit and learning,Will always find their kind;Or perhaps in SlytherinYou'll make your real friends,Those cunning folk use any meansTo achieve their ends.So put me on! Don't be afraid!And don't get in a flap!You're in safe hands (though I have none)For I'm a Thinking Cap!"The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment."When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails slowly walked to the stool, put on the hat and sat down."HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat.The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at Hufflepuff table."Bones, Susan!""HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again, and Susan scurried off to sit next to Hannah."Boot, Terry!""RAVENCLAW!"The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them."Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers."Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin."Finch-Fletchley, Justin!""HUFFLEPUFF!""Finnigan, Seamus," a sandy-haired boy sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor"Granger, Hermione!"Despite having gone through the sorting ceremony once, Hermione was a little nervous. Fighting was lot more easier than being on a stage with hundreds of eyes on you.She put on the hat and sat quietly on the stool. It took about half a minute to decide which house she belonged to."GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat. The Gryffindor table once again burst into loud cheers.Hermione slowly walked to the familiar long table and sat on an empty sit."Granger, Kent!"The crowd saw a boy, little over five feet tall, walked out of the line. The extra attention was due to the fact that his surname was same as Hermione's, who was just sorted.Kent was nervous. Neither in his past life nor in this life had he ever stood in front of a crowd with all their attention on him. It was a little nerve-wracking.He quietly walked to the stool and picked up the hat. He took a glance inside. It looked clean.He sat on the stool and put on the hat. The hat fell over his eyes hindering half of his vision.'Godric Gryffindor sure had a huge head,' a funny picture appeared in his mind.'Let's see what we have here,' a rough voice sounded in his head. He waited for the hat's "evaluation" of him, see if it matches with his own ''evaluation".'A curious yet cautious mind,' The hat said in his head, 'Brave heart but with a sense of restraint. A seeker of knowledge. Where to put youâ€“''Just put me in Gryffindor,' said Kent.'Gryffindor eh?' chuckled the hat, 'So be itâ€“"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat.The table to the far left burst into cheers.Putting the hat back on the stool, Kent walked to the Gryffindor table and sat down next to his sister. He took a quick glance at the long table to the far right.It was then Neville's turn. The round-faced boy fell over on his way to the stool. It took about a minute to decide as the hat finally shouted "GRYFFINDOR!".Then a thin boy by the name "MacDougal, Morag" was sorted into Slytherine.It was finally Malfoy's turn. He was blonde guy with a "I am better than everyone" fac. He walked confidently to the stool. The hat barely touched his head before it shouted "SLYTHERINE".The three student after him with surname, "Moon", "Nott", "Parkinson" were also sorted into Slytherine one by one.Then a pair of twin girls by the name "Parvati Patil" and "Padma Patil" were sorted. The first one to Gryffindor and the second one to Ravenclaw.Then Kent saw the familiar bespectacled "Perks, Sally-Anne" walking to the stool nervously. It took only few seconds for the hat to sort her into Ravenclaw."Potter, Harry!" When Harry's name was called the hall fell into a strange silence. There were occasional whispers among the students as the black-haired boy slowly walked to the stool.After Harry put on the hat, Kent noticed that he was whispering something.A minute later, the hat shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!"The Gryffindor table burst into loud cheer and applause. It was different from before as most of the students in the Gryffindor table stood up and clapped. A pair of twins with red hair even shouted "We got Potter! We got Potter!".And now there were only four people left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean," a black boy taller than most first years, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. "Turpin, Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and "Weasley, Ronald", the red haired boy who was with Harry Potter was sorted into Gryffindor.The ceremony ended with the last student by the name "Zabini, Blaise" being sorted into Slytherin.Headmaster Dumbledore rose from his seat. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there."Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!""Thank you!"He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered.'Eccentricity stems from power and authority.' Kent figured. Dumbledore was probably the only wizard who held three to four positions at the same time and also one of the most powerful wizards of all time.Soon he was snapped out of the thoughts as food magically appeared on the gold laden plates. There were so many varieties of food: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.'Elves' magic is really advanced,' thought Kent as he began eating. He really envied the ability of the elves to remain invisible and teleport which seems to have no barrier, at least he never heard any.Then his attention turned to ghost that just came out through the table."That does look good," said the ghost in the ruff sadly."Can't you -- ?" Harry Potter, the bespectacled boy offered the piece of steak he was going to eat."I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years," said the ghost. "I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.""I know who you are!" said Ron suddenly. "My brothers told me about you -- you're Nearly Headless Nick!""I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy -- " the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted."Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?"Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted."Like this," he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, "So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost."Kent and other first-years nearby, looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy."How did he get covered in blood?" asked Seamus with great interest."I've never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding...As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families."I'm half-and-half," said Seamus. "Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him."The others laughed."What about you, Neville?" said Ron."Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch," said Neville, "but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad."'No wonder Neville's so clumsy,' Kent thought.At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent."Ahem -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you."First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well."Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins."I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors."Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch."And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.""And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried Dumbledore.After singing the 'out-of-tune' song, the Gryffindor's first-years followed Percy the prefect through a series of moving stairs to finally reach the portrait of a fat lady in pink silk dress."Password?" asked the lady in the portrait."Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a round room full of squashy armchairs.Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another.

After setting up a simple warning ward around his bed which he had learned from Hermione, Kent finally relaxed.Despite having his danger sense, Kent set up the ward as an extra precaution.He was quite certain that Scabbers, being a coward that he was, won't attack anyone in the dormitory but it was quite unsettling to sleep in the same dorm as a murderer.Scabbers was the rat that Ron Weasley currently owned. It was not actually a rat but Peter Pettigrew in his animagus form.Unlike majority of the Wizarding world, Kent knew that it was Pettigrew who blew up the street and killed twelve muggles framing Sirius Black.With the assurance of his acute sense of danger that works even if he is asleep and the warning ward he set up, he closed the curtain to his bed.Under the dim simmering light of the lamp, the tiredness of today's journey took over as he fell asleep.The next morning, he woke up early around 6 o'clock. After brushing his teeth and taking a quick shower he changed to a pair of warm clothes and went to the common room. It was empty.He went back to the dorm and took out a book titled "Magical Theory" written by Adalbert Waffling.Back in the common room, he dragged an arm-chair closer to the fireplace and sat on it.With nothing else to do, he quietly read the book.No matter how many times he read the book, it never seized to amaze him.The book had several theories about how magic came to be or what magic actually is. It gave him a lot of inspirations on how to improve the spells he had learned. Especially the wand movements, which he found were nothing but runes."What are you reading?" asked a female voice from behind him."A book on magical theory," Kent answered. He was already aware of Hermione's presence."Have you had breakfast?" asked Hermione."Aren't students supposed to eat together?" asked Kent."It's not mandatory but a tradition," Hermione said, "let's go, I am hungry.""Wait for a sec," he said as he went back to the dormitory to put the book in his trunk.After having a fulfilling breakfast, Kent followed Hermione to the library.It was a huge library, probably the largest he had ever seen. Seeing so many books, Kent wondered if he would be able to record all of it.'Let's start with spells and transfiguration,' he decided.Spells are the most important part of an wizards strength, be it auxiliary spells like levitation spell and summoning charm or offensive spells like the cutting curse and blasting hex.As for transfiguration, it is the most versatile branch of magic. You can use it to attack, defend and also for auxiliary purposes.Hermione being familiar with every corner of the library showed him the relevant sections.Kent first went to the section with books mostly on transfiguration, theory and laws related to it.There were three shelves with about hundreds of books in each. He was unfamiliar with most of them, so he chose the books randomly.He was just going to record the information contained in them.He carried the book to the table next to the shelves. There were very few students at this time in the library. Kent guessed that it must be because classes hadn't started yet, there were no homework whatsoever. Only the ones who loved reading and acquiring knowledge would come to the library so early.Leaning against the wooden chair, he activated the record function of the system library.He opened a thick book with leathered cover and started flipping through the pages.He would pause and glance at each page for a moment and then glance at the next one.In the beginning he had underestimated the capability of the system, especially the library function. A glance is what it requires to record a piece of information like page of a book or a picture.The process of pausing and glancing at each page went on for about a minute before he finished the hundred and fifty page book. Putting it aside, he opened the next one and went through the same process.One by one the pile containing ten books were finished within an hour. He put back all the book to their original position and chose the next batch of books.He kept repeating the same process for the next two hours. After that he had to slow down because the library started filling in with students mostly seniors in the sixth or seventh years.It was almost noon when he finished the first shelf. Looking at remaining two shelves, he determined that it would take another day to record all the books related to transfiguration that are not in restricted section.He really wanted to record the more advanced knowledge from the books in restricted sections but unfortunately a slip from one of the teachers was needed.'Don't be so impatient, Kent!' he reminded himself. There wasn't much to worry because it only needed good performance and a plausible excuse to get the teacher's permission.After lunch, he returned back to the library.If possible, he wanted to record all books on transfiguration today.This time, instead of going back and forth between the table and the shelves, he pulled out a book while standing, took a glance at each page and then return it to its original position. It was way faster and convenient.The next day, Kent woke up early like usual, took a shower and changed to his Hogwarts uniform.Gryffindor first years was scheduled to have their first transfiguration class with the Slytherins at 9 o'clock in the morning.Just like yesterday he and his sister didn't do the daily exercise like they used to do in their home. It was because they hadn't found a good place outside of prying eyes.It was unfortunate that the simulation space of the system had little effect on the physical body.Having their breakfast and resting for a bit in the common room, Kent and Hermione went directly to the classroom where professor McGonagall would be taking the transfiguration class.Although they reached ten minutes earlier than the designated time for the start of the class, there were already lot of first years in the room.The classroom was huge. There was a big blackboard behind the teacher's desk in the front. A cat, ignored by most of the students, was quietly resting on the desk.The student's desks were arranged in rows with certain spaces between them. It was probably to reduce the possibility of students accidentally hitting each other with spells.The Granger siblings sat down in an empty desk at the back of the first row from the right.The students of Gryffindor and Slytherine House were sitting in separate rows as if they had an unspoken rule.Five minutes had passed since the start of the class time but there was no sign of professor McGonagall. Kent knew that the odd looking cat sitting on the desk was in fact the professor's animagus form. Kent could guess that she was waiting for Harry Potter.Kent was curiously watching the behaviour of the cat.The cat's ears perked up as she stood up abruptly. Moments later, Kent heard a pair hurried footsteps from outside the classroom.A pair of boys came running in. They were panting as if they had run a marathon.Their entrance attracted the attention of every student in the room. It was mostly because of the bespectacled boy with black hair. He was the boy-who-lived after all.Seeing that professor McGonagall wasn't present, both of the boys sighed with relief."Looks like we came in time," the red haired boy laughed but it was cut short by a sharp voice."No Mr. Weasley, you and Mr. Potter are five minutes late," the cat that standing atop the front desk jumped and changed into professor McGonagall and said, "I hope that I won't have any students coming into my class late from the next day."For the first half of the class, professor McGonagall introduced the students to the art of transfiguration, theory behind it and the mistakes to avoid.The students scribbled down everything.Even though Kent had finished the first year course with the help of the system, he noted down everything. There were lot of unique insights from the professor in it; they couldn't be found in the book."Today you will be learning how to turn a match into needle," the professor said, "but before we start, I must warn you that transfiguration is one of most dangerous magic. I will not have anyone messing around in my class."After getting a stern warning from the professor, each student was given a match.Most of the students started trying according to the instructions given by professor McGonagall, only to realise that it was not as easy as shown by the professor.At the back, Kent"Well done, Mr. Granger," professor McGonagall said with a smile, "five points to Gryffindor for your excellent performance.""Thank you, professor." replied Kent politely. He was not being humble. He himself knew that he was not a genius.Having an adult mind not only provided Kent with many benefits but also with a great obstacle.The obstacle being the rigidity of his thinking making it harder to believe in anything that is not normal, thus affecting his magic, be it transfiguration or spells.He spent countless hours practicing spells and transfiguration in the simulation space of the system, to overcome this psychological barrier.The successful transfiguration done by Kent triggered other students in the room to be more enthusiastic about turning the match into needle, especially the Slytherine students. It was quite embarrassing and unacceptable for them to be overtaken by muggleborn students in terms of magic.But their enthusiasm was short lived as they couldn't produce any change whatsoever in the colour or structure of the match.At end of the lesson, it was only Kent who successfully turned the match into needle. As for Hermione, she only changed the colour of match to silver which was was purely intentional.

The OfferingEnglandDiagon AlleyWeasley's Wizard WheezesAre you sure? I need to replenish our reserves of Peruvian Darkness Powder, and I already have the trip to Peru all planned.""George, I am just as surprised as you are. But it does check out. The best ingredients are not actually harvested in Peru.""Wellâ€¦ then where?""Mexico.""Are you trying to cheer me up with a prank, Harry?""No. You know I'm not the best at pranking. Not even passable."George Weasley sighed. "I know, brâ€¦ little brother."A heavy silence fell between the two. It was Harry who broke it. "I miss him too."George swallowed the lump in his throat, and passed an arm over Harry's shoulder. A comforting gesture gesture for both. "I know. I know. Everyday I expect to see him."Harry nodded. George continued. "You know why I let my beard grow?"His friend shook his head."I cannot stand to see myself in the mirror." He closed his eyes. "Angelina thinks it's because of my ear." He smiled sadly, caressing the mangled flesh. "It's because every time I shave, I see Fred looking back at me. And it breaks my heart every single time. The first week I broke all the mirrors we had at ourâ€¦" a tear fell down his face, he wiped it distractedly. "At our flat." He finished."I justâ€¦" he waved a hand, trying to explain. "I don't knowâ€¦ I just stared at my reflection, waiting for Fred to talk to me, he usually was the first one to say something. I was there, standing with the razor in my hand, my face full of foam. Just staring, Harry. Just staring at my brother. Waiting for him to talk." His voice broke in a ragged sob. "I don't know how to explain it, that emptiness in my chest.""George." Harry whispered softly, when his friend raised his head after a long time. "I know how it feels.""Do you?" There was no anger in the question. "How can you know it, little brother?""It was back in my First Year. Do you remember the three headed dog?"George nodded. "Oh, yes." He smiled a little, remembering, " it scared us out of our skins, that ruddy dog.""Us too. Ron, Hermione and me.""Wellâ€¦ close to where Fluffy was guarding the entrance to a lower room, Dumbledore had another thing stored. A bloody mirror."George imitated Hermione's voice. "Honestly, Harry. Language."Harry chuckled, George had it down. From the voice, to the tone, even his facial expression were all Hermione's. He continued, shaking George's shoulders. "It was a standing mirror, a magical one.""Mirror, mirror, on the wallâ€¦" George intoned, "who is the Harryest of them all?""Be serious, George!" A moment later, Harry's face fell, remembering his late Godfather, who loved that awful pun."Sorry, it was not my intention. Please, go on.""It's okay. Wellâ€¦ it had a strange inscription on top. I can't even say it from memory, but the thing was called The Mirror of Erised. It doesn't show your reflection, but what you really, in the bottom of your heart, what you really want."George gasped. "Iâ€¦" he hesitated."It showed me my family." Harry looked up. "Dad, Mum, holding me close. I had never in my life up to thenâ€¦ I had never felt loved, George. Never." The lone twin didn't know what to do. He knew Harry had been gravely mistreated by those animals. Denied everything but scraps. And even those, given with hate and disdain. It was a wonder he had turned out as a good guy."I spent several nights there, just looking at that illusion. Even then, I knew it was not real. But I had to be there to feel them. And you know what? Later that year, when Hagrid gave me the album of pictures he had collected for me, the people from the mirror didn't really match with the pictures. But these, even in pictures, these were my parents.""I didn't know that, Harry.""It's okay, George. It was a long time ago. Maybe someday I will tell you more. When we are both ready. Right now," he stood up brusquely, slapping his thighs, "we have to plan your trip."Late OctoberMexico CityHernandez Household"Welcome to my humble home, Mister Weesli." The Mexican wizard slapped George's back, almost knocking him down. "Sandra! CariÃ±o!" He bellowed, "tenemos visita!"A dark skinned woman came down the stair. She smiled widely, wiping her hands in a hanky she put into the pocket of her apron. "Wellâ€¦comeâ€¦" she said, frowning. She shook her head and said to her husband, "Apenas me medio acuerdo de mis clases de InglÃ©s, Sergio! Dile que es bienvenido a la casa y que su cuarto estarÃ¡ listo en un ratito."Sergio HernÃ¡ndez kissed her in the cheek, pinching her bottom at the same time. She slapped his hand playfully. "Que va a pensar el seÃ±or?!"Sergio laughed, and winked at her, "Que mi esposa es la mÃ¡s linda de la ciudad!" He turned back to George. "My wife doesn't really speak English, but she says your room will be ready in a few minutes.""Ah, um," George opened the common phrases book Harry had given him, smiled awkwardly at both, and said "Grass-ee-as, sen-eeora Err-nan-dess." He raised his eyebrows questioningly, hoping he had not mangled the words too badly.Sergio nodded in approval. "Good enoff, Mister Weesli!" He nodded, tilting his head to the left. "You'll need a bit of practice, but that's okay, no one is born knowing. Now, you must be tired and hungry." He checked his watch, "We eat in half an hour, you're welcome to join us, but," he raised his right index, "I suggest you don't add the salsa to your food. My wife is famous for her home made guacamole, and she likes it really, really spicy!"George nodded, "I've heard the stories. It can't be that hot, I mean."Sergio laughed again, George would have compared it to Hagrid's booming laughter, but his host actually sounded even louder than the half-giant! "Don't say I didn't warn you. Well, I'll just ask Sandra to reserve a bit of guacamole with less chili."Half an hour later, George Weasley realized that Mexican food could be both delicious and a torture at the same time.He put a bit of the curious green stuff on the meat on his platter, "Seg-ooro keh no peeca?" He said, remembering the phrase book phonetic instructions."Quite sure, this may be just a little hot, but just a little. Kid stuff, really." A child of about six years, with a wild mop of hair that reminded George of Harry's own, though short and quite spiky, signaled George for permission to take a small spoonful, George nodded, unsure of what to say.The boy, Manuel, George remembered the name, proceeded to take a tortilla, putting some pieces of chicharrÃ³n on it, spread the guacamole over the crispy pieces, rolled the tortilla, and bit into it with evident pleasure."See? Kid stuff!" Sergio boomed.However, Sandra filled George's glass with fresh watermelon juice, diluted in water and with just a little bit of sugar added. "Por si las moscas." She said."What did she say?""Actuallyâ€¦ it doesn't translate well, but it means 'Just in case.'"George did follow Sergio's instruction, under Manuel's expectant gaze. George recognized the gleam in the boys eyes. He and Fred had it just before springing a prank!'I'm about to make a mistake. I knowâ€¦' he thought. He cut the meat, and without hesitation, he chewed. The taste was amazing! He closed his eyes for a moment, concentrating on the favour and texture.He nodded as he swallowed, "Mui sav-rosso!" He said, and it was then when it hit him. His tongue began to get warn, then hot, and finally, he felt as if his whole mouth was on fire! He fanned his hands desperately, looking around. Sergio put the glass in his hands, and George drank it in three frantic gulps!Sandra had already poured another, and gave it to him.George managed to empty the whole jar of watermelon water. He gasped and wiped his face with a hanky, still fanning his mouth."Esta bien, SeÃ±or Weesli?" Sandra asked. George nodded spasmodically. "Yeah, I thinkâ€¦ That has quite a punch!"With all seriousness, Sergio pontified, "Mister Weesli, if a Mexican says a salsa isn't hot, it is hot. If he says it's mildly hot, it is very hot. If he says it is very hot, it is extremely hot. And if he says it is really, really hot, you better have your will registered and your affairs in order." Then he broke laughing. "I mean it!""And this was?" George gestured at the little dish."Not hot."Sandra took the dish, replacing it with another. "Es solo aguacate con sal. Sin chile."Sergio translated, while Manuel snickered "Avocado with a pinch of salt. No chili. I trust you'll find it to your liking." He smiled again.With some fear, George tried it. But just as promised, it was not spicy at all.That night, Sandra and her grandmother, decorated a small table near the dining room. There were some pictures, and, to George's surprise, small skulls made of sugar or chocolate among the bright orange flowers.Sergio pulled two chairs to the backyard, and sat with George. He had brought a couple of beers from the kitchen and gave one to George."Curious?""Yeah. In England we celebrate both Halloween and Samhain, we plÃ¡cate the angry ghosts, at least, symbolically. I had never seen sugar skulls." He scratched his head, puzzled."We are a complicated mix of traditions, Mister Weesli. Some from our native ancestor, some from our Spaniard ancestors. But the short version Is this. We remember our departed in this form. Tradition says that the night of October the 31st, the veil between the land of the living," he sweeped his hand around, "and the land of the dead, gets open, and the ghost of our late relatives has permission to come up for a visit. We, the living, put an altar for them, an offering, with their pictures, so they know we still remember them. That night, we prepare their favorite food, and put it in the altar, so their spirits can eat once again.""And they do eat it?" George leaned forward on his chair."Symbolically, yes. They eat theâ€¦ the essence of the food, because they are spirits. We do get to eat the rest, of course." His smile was full of memories. "Come, I'll introduce you. And explain the meaning of each part of the altar."October the 31stBack in EnglandGeorge Weasley's FlatEarly EveningGeorge arranged the table just as Sergio and Sandra had shown him. On the table, a jar of water, a little bowl full of salt, several lit candles, incense, cempasÃºchil flowers (those had been a bit of a problem at customs, until the inspector determined the plants were not magical), a petate(kind of rug/tablecloth/bed, made of woven fibers), a small ceramic dog, a round bread Sergio had called "Pan de Muerto" (Bread of the Dead), a picture of Fred, a plate with Fred's favorite dinner dish, a sandwich with bacon, butter, tomato and cheese. George had barely managed to prepare it, the memories kept coming. And finally, two chocolate skulls. Both twins preferred chocolate to candy. On the forehead of one, Fred's name, lovingly written on a small piece of paper; on the other, George's name. Of course, under each paper, there was another, with the other's name. Fred would have approved.George checked his altar once again."There's water, Fred, for you to drink. Salt, to keep your spirit pure. Candles, to light your way. Incense, to keep evil spirits away. You know who you are, guys, you are not welcome. The flowers," George scratched his head, "I'm not really sure about those, but that's how I was shown, so here they are, I hope they will guide you here, brother. The petateâ€¦ I had never even heard of it, but well, today is a mantlecloth. The izcuintli, the toy dog, to keep you company in the way here and back. The bread, wellâ€¦ it is very tasty, I'm sure you'll like it. And a sandwich, just the way you liked it. Be welcome to this humble dinner, Fred. I miss you."George set everything as Sergio and Sandra had shown him. He lit the candles, making sure there was nothing flammable around, and setting a few fire-proofing charms, just in case. "Ah, I almost forgot." He poured two measures of firewhiskey in two glasses. He took one, and clinked it against the other, "For you, Fred, the best brother I could have asked for. Cheers!"And he drank it in one gulp. Two puffs of smoke came out of his ears. He sat on a comfy chair, watching his offering.And remembered his late brother, until he fell asleep with a smile on his lips.For the first time in a very long time, he felt at peace. The emptiness in his chest would be still there in the morning; but for now, just for this night, Fred and George Weasley were together again.

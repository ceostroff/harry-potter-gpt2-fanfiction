3rd Person POV { Belle }As everyone re-told their summer, Belle sat at the Hufflepuff table, looking at each person as they entered the hall to see if any were injured. As per usual, her gaze lingered on the Hufflepuff students for a little longer when she suddenly noticed a Gryffindor student shining. Immediately, she knew that it was a sign that a glamour had been placed upon them. What she didn't understand was why the student was Harry Potter.He was wringing his hands and nervously glancing around the hall with his green eyes. As Belle was watching him, he walked with a limp, only noticeable to those really paying attention. Once the Golden Trio were seated, Hermione taped him on the arm to get his attention. He flinched and spun around in his seat to look at her. Ron, for once, noticed that something's up, so he clamped a hand on Harry's shoulder in a way that's supposed to be comforting, but all it did was cause Harry to jump in his seat.Right when Belle was about to turn her attention to the Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, she noticed that a certain blond is watching Harry closely. He caught her looking at him, so she tilted her head to the side, both coming to a silent agreement and understanding that there must be a reason as to why there's a golden glow around the golden boy.

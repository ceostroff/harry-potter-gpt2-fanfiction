.A/N: Please accept my apologies for somewhat misleading you. This is not a new fic, just a story of how lacking FFN is in their protection of writers.TROLLSApparently the Dramione trolls are at it again. They are simple-minded little troglodytes who sit behind their screens and anonymously "review" Dramione fics using other author names â€” Dramione authors and famous real-world authors.Example:Story: Something Beautiful in ReturnChapter: 17 Chapter 17From: Casandra Clare (Guest)Add a disgustingly racist, sexually explicit, misogynistic, foul 'review'These trolls believe they are morally and ethically superior to everyone. But their gleeful use of rape and sodomy, suicide suggestions, and death threats in these comments suggest otherwise.It's a sad world when a certain type of person thinks it's appropriate to use violent words to try to harm others. It's even sadder to think that these people have the time to target certain authors with these words just because they disagree with them.The Dramione fandom is strong.The writers and readers are good people who believe in redemption and second chances. They believe that people can change, that there's always room for forgiveness if it is deserved.I feel so much pity for the trolls. I often wonder what has happened in their lives that has made them so unfeeling and morally bankrupt.If you are a Dramione writer, please keep writing. We love your work and will always support you. And if you see our names in your work as a guest, please know it's not us.If you are a Dramione reader, we thank you for taking the time to read and enjoy our work.I'm sure this 'fic' will garner some attention from the trolls, but if they're trolling me, they're leaving everyone else alone.

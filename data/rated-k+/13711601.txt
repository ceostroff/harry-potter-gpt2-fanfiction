July 12, 1984Little Whining, SurreyNumber 3, Privet Drive"Well here we are" a fairly muscular man with tan skin, buzz cut chocolate brown hair, dark blue almond shaped eyes, with a slightly pointed nose, thin lips and a scar running from his neck to between his shoulder blades, standing around 6 feet 5 inches wearing a plain black t-shirt, cargo pants and combat boots sighed as he pulled into the drive way of their temporary home"Oh come on Daniel it wouldn't be that bad" A curvy woman with the same tan skin, long wavy black tresses pulled into a tight ponytail, round dark chocolate colored eyes with long lashes, a cute button nose, perfect pouty lips standing around 5 feet 3 inches wearing a plain white button up shirt, a long skirt that reached just above her ankles and 5 inches black heels "I'm sure that our little one can grow here just fine""I hope your right Dinah I hope your right" the man Daniel Remus White said as he moved to the back of their Ford Sierra to take their sleeping four year old daughter out of the car"Is Asvoria still asleep?" the woman Dinah White nee Bonifacio asked as she grabbed several bags that contained their belongings"Yeah I just hope she stays like this until tomorrow morning"Daniel sighed as he helped his wife with their bagsThe next morning Dinah got up early to cook her family breakfast and to walk around the neighborhood and take in the new faces and sights"Mama where are you going?" her four year old daughter asked as she walked down the stairs in her cute Pikachu pajamas,her wavy black bob cut hair framing her cute face and expressive dark blue almond shaped eyes,pale skin and perfect pouty lips"I was just about to take a walk want to join mama?" Dinah asked her daughter with a smile"Mmmhmmm" Asvoria nodded happily before she ran to her room and got dressed"She takes after you in reading but my love of the outdoors" Daniel said chuckling as he walked in to the dinning room"And my dad didn't help much by taking her to our mountain side property and beach front property back home" Dinah said smiling and shaking her head at the memory of her parents nearly giving her a heart attack when they took her daughter without her knowledge"Nor did mine they bought her a whole library's worth of books" Daniel said also chucklingWhen Asvoria was ready they all went for their walk and they immediately found themselves irritated by their neighbors. As both elders were pointedly ignoring everyone of their neighbors Asvoria was looking at a tiny boy with messy black hair, pale skin and sad emerald green eyes he was being bullied by three more larger boys before a woman who looked like a horse walked out of the house only to shout at the boy calling his freak"Mama, Papa" Asvoria whispered frightened by the horse like woman's screaming"Oh don't mind him dear he's a little bastard always getting into trouble" an annoying sounding woman said dismissing the hurt tiny boy making Dinah want to kill her"I take back what I said this neighborhood is pathetic Danny please tell me that you plan on helping that little boy" Dinah demand her husband once they all walked into their house"I'll call my brother but for now we just have to try and live our lives here until our new house in Tenby is done" Daniel said hugging his wifeAs the summer season went on Asvoria would watch the tiny boy from her window and as her papa's instance took pictures of everythime he would interact with the Dursleys, Dinah being a doctor always took not of the obvious signs of abuse and neglect on the little boy even going as far as to look through the medical records in secret, Daniel often times tried to slyly invite the boy over even suggesting to babysit the boy when he last talked to Vernon Dursley but was declined much to his displeasure. When school started Asvoria being a brave and smart little girl went up to the tiny boy and made friends with him soon she found herself being bullied by the pig Dudley Dursley and his cronies but she wasn't chased away especially because she was never one for listening to people too stupid to spell four wrong, soon she and the tiny boy Harry were almost inseparable.July 27,1984Little Whining Police Station"You're right Danny these are serious charges especially since it looks like this has been going on for years now" Denver White Daniel's younger brother said looking over the evidence his brother, sister in law and niece gathered"Dev can you make sure we get custody over the boy Riri really likes him and keeps making us promise that he'll be her brother soon" Daniel said making Denver laugh"I think if we're lucky the judge of the case could be mom and she'll just hand in the adoption papers tomorrow" he said jokingly"When will you be arresting them because last night Asvoria said that she saw Harry being thrown onto a stove burner while it was on I had to hold. My wife back before she got my gun and killed the whale of a man" Daniel said rubbing his arm where his wife had managed to hit him"Right now actually" Denver said grabbing his jacket before he started barking out orders to his fellow policemenThat night Vernon and Petunia Dursley were dragged off kicking and screaming as Denver handed Harry over to Dinah who rode in the ambulance with Harry all the way to the hospital. That night everyone in Private Drive all had started feeling guilty for ignoring Harry's pleading look for help. At the hospital Harry was under the caring and watchful eyes of Dinah who took it upon herself to help her hopefully new son heal while Daniel told their family about the hopefully new addition to their family which they all wished soon

Once Harry was back to nearly healthy Dinah and Daniel took him and Asvoria to Pembrokeshrine town,Tenby West Wales here their new house was done and ready for use. It was a beautiful mansion near the beach and had a perfect view of the sunrise and sunset. It had three floors the ground floor having a grand elegant but modern Living room with warm colors, the kitchen that was mainly dark wood and silvers and the dinning room that could seat close to 9 people, on the second floor were the entertainment room with multiple games like ping-pong, Nintendo game consoles with the games and a play station to the side, an in house theater, board games and several other games, beside that was a music room with all kinds of instruments and a mini recording studio, across from that was the library which was sound proof and was already stocked with a lot of books and four computers one for each of them, beside the library were two offices one for Daniel and one for Dinah, the third floor mostly had rooms the master bedroom which was elegantly decorated with blues and whites for the parents, Harry's room which was like a mini universe with all the twinkling lights on the ceiling along with the solar system model hanging above the room, next to that was Asvoria's room which looked like a mini bird sanctuary from all the beautiful birds painted on her walls and the sky like ceiling after that were the multiple guestrooms, outside the mansion was a beautiful pool with a mini waterfall, slide, diving platform and etc. the kids also had to go to a new school but it was fun for them seeing as Asvoria would always encourage Harry to do his best in everything soon the little boy was the top of all his classes second only to his sister except in music, math and history where they tie. After a whole year on July 31,1986 Harry James Potter was now officially Harrison Daniel Bonifacio-White and it was the happiest day in his life. That was 3 years agoDecember 11,1990Pembrokeshrine ,West Wales"Great job son" Daniel praised as he wrapped his arm around Harry's shoulders as the boy wiped his sweaty forehead with his hockey jersey. Harry was now extremely healthy from all the food that his parents and sister gave him, the multi vitamins his mother had him drink daily and the physical activities his parents enrolled him in, he was 4'5",a lithe frame,slightly muscular legs and arms,his hair was still a messy mop of raven black which he styled to hide his scar,same emerald green eyes and pale skin"Yeah the last goal was amazing Har" Asvoria chimed happily as they all walked to their car. She also grew from an adorable baby faced child into a beautiful blossoming young lady. Her wavy black hair was now up to her mid back,her height now 4'5",her lips still a perfect pout,her eyes still the expressive dark blue almond shape"Thanks sis" Harry said smiling as he smiled to his sister"Let's hurry and get home you both have marshall arts this afternoon remember" Dinah said smiling at her kids"I thought you had ice skating today sis?" Harry asked once he and his sister were in the car"No I actually had German and my tutor said that since I learn abnormally fast I will be finishing in a week" Asvoria said smiling at her brother"Should I be concerned that my kids eat through knowledge like they eat ice cream" Daniel whispered to his wife"I hope not but really they have a father who use to be proud pilot of the royal Air Force and is now a well respected Archeologists who has many popular finds and a mother who is a well known doctor and has a number of clinics around the world not to mention that they both inherit mass amounts of money from their grandfathers from both sides"Dinah whispered back before turning to her kid who were happily chatting away about something "Well Ria where do you want to celebrate your birthday tomorrow?""Home" Asvoria said simply"I'll make the cake!" Harry chirped happily"Always" Asvoria said smiling at her brotherThe next day Harry and Dinah we're preparing the pool side table for Asvoria's party while Daniel entertained the birthday girl in the entertainment room when suddenly they heard unexpected knocking"Who could that be?" Dinah asked her son before heading to the door only to find a thin man with sallow skin, a large, hooked nose, and white even teeth. He has shoulder-length, greasy black hair which frames his face, and cold, black eyes. He wears black, flowing robes which give him the appearance of "an overgrown bat"."May I enter mrs. White"he asked respectfully"I am Severus Snape a representative of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry your daughter Asvoria has been accepted""Oh um of course sir. Harry honey go get your father and sister"Dinah said before leading the man to their living room "Would you like some tea or coffee maybe?""No thank you mrs. White" the dower man said before Asvoria,Harry and Daniel walked into the room"Everyone this is Severus Snape a representative for a school named Hogwarts""Good morning sir"Asvoria said respectfully "I am Asvoria Divinagracia Bonifacio-White""Good morning sir I am Harrison Daniel Bonifacio-White"Harry said equally as respectful before they heard a loud thud making them all look at the man only to see him sitting down in shock"No it can't be Harry Potter"he whispered in shock"Sir?"Harry called worriedly"Mr. Snape are you alright?"Daniel asked slightly shocked to see a man having a panic attack on his couch"Mr. and Mrs. White could I trouble you for that tea now?"Severus said"We'll prepare it would you like Assam black tea,Chai,Earl Grey,Smoked Lapsang Souchong or perhaps Pu'erh tea" Harry asked knowing that they'd need the strong tea because Asvoria or his mum wouldn't let anyone have strong alcohol this early in the morning"Anything will do darling"Dinah said trying not to imagine breaking her morning alcohol ban something inside her screamed that she'll need it"Mr. Snape why did you react like that upon seeing our son?"Daniel asked"Mr. and Mrs. White how did you come to have Harry Potter in your home?" He asked still slightly in shock"I'm sorry mr. Snape but if it's not too much trouble would you please answer us first" Dinah said calmly and softly as she observed the man "This man has been abused,bullied and tortured I wonder where he got all those scars from and his nose is definitely not natural""Mr. Potter has been reported missing for roughly over five year Dumbledore said that he was kidnapped from his relatives" Severus said before sighing really wanting to drink some Firewiskey"Mr. Snape we didn't kidnap our son we legally adopted him after rescuing him from his abusive relatives" Daniel said coldly"Honestly I thank you for that I knew Petunia and she would have abuse and broken the boy if he had stayed" Severus said before looking at the couple "As for why I am here originally Mr. and Mrs. White has your daughter ever displayed unusual talents or did anything extraordinarily amazing that it's almost impossible to believe?""Does making her piano play without touching the keys? Making several antique artifacts dance and sing and swords fight? Count"Daniel asked"Or making trees grow extremely fast? Hissing at snakes?Finding themselves on the school's rooftop?"Dinah asked"Yes and yes though the fourth one is a rare gift. Your children are able to do those things and more due to them being born with magical cores"Severus said as the kids walked back into the room with two cups of chai pumpkin tea,a cup of black coffee, and two glasses of chocolate milk with whipped cream on top then gently distributed them to everyone "Thank you""How does our Harry have a magical core is it from his parents?" Dinah asked shocking Severus who expected her to ask that question regarding her daughter"You are correct mrs. White mr.Potter's parents were able to use magic as well his father was an heir to a noble and ancient house and his mother a Muggleborn like your daughter" Severus said"I take it that you weren't fond of my birth dad"Harry commented"No I was often their target for their cruel pranks as brave as your father was he was spoiled and became a bully to me and everyone in my house just because everyone thought that we would all turn evil"Severus said making Asvoria frown"Mr. Snape would you please show us some magic please"Asvoria requested trying to lighten the mood"But of course ms.White"he said before turning the butterfly on her hair pin into a real butterfly shocking Daniel and Dinah in an amazed stupor"Amazing!"Daniel exclaimed before blushing at his sudden outburst"And we can learn to do that at this school?"Harry asked excited as Asvoria was almost vibrating in excitement"It explains so much oh can all witches and wizards talk to animals?Are dragons real? What do you teach mr.Snape?-"Asvoria said before Harry covered her mouth and nose"Sorry our daughter is always a curious one"Daniel said chuckling as Asvoria bit her brother's hand making him yelp and growl at her while she smirked mischievously at him"Quite alright and to answer your question ms.White No,Yes and Potions"Severus answered amused by the Muggleborn girl and the Boy-Who-Lived"Can they still do their none magical studies?"Dinah asked worried"They can I will make arrangements with their head of house and the Deputy head"Severus said making Dinah sigh in relief"What else can you tell us about this school?"Daniel asked wanting to know everything about where his kids wanted to go to schoolAfter Severus explained everything to the Whites the adults looked doubtful along with the kids but the kids were still willing to try. When lunch rolled around Harry and Asvoria managed to convince Severus to stay and eat with them their the two adults surprisingly became quick friends with the dower man and Harry got to know about his parents both good and bad at the end of the day they all decided to visit Diagon Alley in Harry's birthday but Severus gave them the location of another alley near their town that they could visit if they wished"Oh and Mr. Snape please call us Dinah and Dan from now on"Dinah said smiling at her new acquaintance"Severus"the dower man said smiling a small smile at the family of fourYey! Nice SeverusI don't own Harry Potter my Ocs are the Whites and their extended family

July 31,1991Pembrokeshrine Town,West Wales"Happy Birthday Harrison"Severus greeted as he entered the house with tall, rather severe-looking, and "sprightly" seventy-year-old woman. She had black hair which was combed back into a tight bun. "May I introduced prof. Minerva McGonagall she will be teaching you Transfiguration and she is also the deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts""Good morning professor McGonagall"Asvoria and Harry greeted from the kitchen where Harry was currently trying to steal some of the frosting from the cake his sister made but before he could touch it Asvoria would hit his hand making him withdraw it and glare at her"Hello professor McGonagall my name is Dinah White and well my husband is currently setting up the table"Dinah said as she walked into the room with 5 presents under each arm "No using magic to see inside these boxes Harrison""Opo mama" Harry said before turning back to make tea for the three adults in the living room"Mrs. White I am to understand that you saved Harry from his relatives may I ask what they did?"Minerva asked looking at the floor"Well I don't usually do this but I could get his medical files if you'd like but it would have to be in my office I want to keep those memories away from Harry "Dinah said before guiding the two to her office after Asvoria assured her that she'll make sure Harry doesn't take a peek at his gifts"You have raised a fine young man mrs. White"Minerva said smiling softly"Thank you though our daughter deserves most of the praise she was always by Harry's side he always trusted her far more than us"Dinah said smiling at the memories of her daughter helping her son in the rougher early days of their adoption "Harry is our son and he's just as important to us as our daughter ""Thank Merlin the Fates gave him to you"Minerva said smilingAfter the small family lunch Severus and Minerva apparated them all to the Leaky Cauldron where the children almost fell on their faces and the adults to the surprise of Minerva and Severus to be upright and just the bares hint of dizziness which they shook off with ease"I use to be a pilot for the royal airforce I'm use to dizzying spins"Daniel said as he helped Harry up"I don't want to talk about it"Dinah said as she helped their daughter"Before anytime else mr. White it would be best to hide your scar and hair"Severus said before Harry pulled up his hoodie"Where to first?"Daniel asked as he was looking around the pub "Don't think I'll be bringing the boys here anytime soon""Gringotts Wizarding Bank where you can convert your money into our currency and perhaps set up an account for ms.White"Minerva explained"Do you not use Pounds or Dollars?"Dinah asked"The wizarding currency of Great Britain consists of three different coins; in decreasing order of value, they are:Galleon ,Sickle, and Knut. They are gold,silver, and bronze, respectively. There are 17 Sickles in a Galleon, and 29 Knuts in a Sickle, meaning there are 493 Knuts to a Galleon."Severus explained to the fascination of the adults"Who run the bank if you don't mind my asking?"Dinah asked smiling at how her children gushed over a snowy owl who seemed to preen at their attention"Goblins"Minerva answered"Just our of curiosity what shouldn't we to when addressing them?"Daniel asked looking slightly pale upon seeing dragon liver"Frankly just be respectful and never demand anything from them"Severus saidFrom Diagon Alley, they all made their way into a set of white stairs leads up to a set of burnished bronze doors. The doors are flanked by a goblin in a uniform of scarlet and gold, it leads into a small entrance hall and another set of doors. Engraved on these silver doors are the words:Enter, stranger, but take heedOf what awaits the sin of greedFor those who take, but do not earn,Must pay most dearly in their turn.So if you seek beneath our floorsA treasure that was never yours,Thief, you have been warned, bewareOf finding more than treasure there."Alright both of you I want you both on your best behavior respect the goblins here and please don't ask them a million questions"Dinah said as Severus led them to a teller"Good day Bloodtooth"Severus greeted respectfully"Ah Lord Prince may your gold forever grow"the goblin greeted before turning to the family "How may Gringotts aid you?""Mr. Daniel and Dinah White would like to exchange their muggle currency for Wizarding money and heir Potter is going to withdraw from his trust vault"Severus said quietly"Um mr. Bloodtooth sir would there be a way to find out if my husband and I have any magical relatives to act as magical guardian to our children or at least assure that Severus is their magical guardian" Daniel said after hearing about how Albus Dumbledore left his son on the Dursleys doorstep asa baby he didn't trust the man"I see that you are well informed Lieutenant White"Bloodtooth said shocking the family "If you would all be so kind as to follow me"Upon reaching the Bloodtooth's office everyone sat in the summoned chairs as Bloodtooth and two other goblins presented them with several parchments"These are goblins are Silverfang and Griphook the account managers of the Prince and Potter vaults and to confirm that this young man truly is Harry James Potter"Bloodtooth said before pulling out a beautiful dagger and giving it to Harry "Three drips into the potion mr. Potter""Is that knife sanitized?"Dinah asked worriedly not wanting her son to get an infection"I can assure you mrs. White that no harm will come to your son"Silverfang said before Harry cut his finger and dropped the acquired amount into the potion "This will take several minutes in the mean time I assume that you would also like to start a vault for your daughter?""Um yes but just out of curiosity what is the exchange rate from dollars to galleon?" Dinah asked as she pulled out her purse"6.64 dollars mrs. White"Griphook said before looking at the woman's wallet "You can also use credit cards here mrs. White""Thank you"Dinah said with a small smile"I thought a galleon would be worth more than that, I mean it is made of gold"Daniel commented before he looked at the left side of the Bloodtooth's office "The Hama Yumi?""I am impressed that you know about it Lieutenant White" Bloodtooth stated impressed "We have been looking for that particular magical artifact for decades now several of our curse breakers already came back empty handed""The test is done and you are indeed Harry James Potter" Griphook said drawing everyone's attention to himHarrison James Black-PotterJames Charlus PotterFatherLily Potter nee EvansBlood adoptionsRegulus BlackBearer"What?!"Severus exclaimed at a complete lack of words "That I oh dear Merlin why does the test state that he is not Lily's son?""What does that mean Tito Severus?"Asvoria asked confused"To everyone's knowledge your brother is the son of James Potter and Lily Potter nee Evans but according to this test you were merely blood adopted by the woman that means that you should have never went to the Dursleys in the first place" Severus explained missing the title before his name"Severus I do hope that you will be staying for dinner later because we have several questions ready" Dinah said exhausted,angry,and much more doubtful about sending her children to Hogwarts"Continue reading Harry"Daniel said hugging his wifeSirius Orion BlackUncleGodfatherSeverus SnapeGodfatherTitles:Heir PotterHeir BlackHeirLord Gryffindor HeirLord PeverellGifts:ParseltongueMagical twin bond to Asvoria Divinagracia Bonifacio-WhiteMetamorphmagusProtective magicMagical Ailments:Magical Block 60%Magical Leech 4%Soul mate bond 100%Compulsion Charms BrokenLoyalty potion linked to the light,Gryffindor,Albus Dumbledore,Ronald Weasley,Molly Weasley,Ginevra WeasleyFlushed outHate potion linked to The dark,Slytherin,Severus Snape,Voldemort Flushed outMarriage Contract to Ginevra Weasley Made by Albus Dumbledore and Molly Weasley October 31,1981"Why do I have a feeling that the last part is bad"Daniel said as his wife groaned"Lord Prince seeing as you are legally heir Potter's magical guardian would you like to do anything about this?"Griphook asked the potions master"Yes break that blasted contract and I would also like for the Whites to have absolute custody of Harrison James Potter in the muggle world I shall remain his magical guardian here" Severus said before Daniel smiled at him"Thank you Severus could you possibly do the same for Asvoria?" He requested not wanting his precious daughter unprotected"Pardon me but due to heir Potter and me. White's magical twin bond I believe that she also gained the protection of house Potter,Peverell and Black as secundarium heredis " Griphook said"Never the less Severus we trust you enough to know that you'll take care of our children so please " Dinah begged"Very well the simplest way would be me blood adopting her as well as Harrison so no one can refute the claim"Severus said and after a nod from the adults they started the rituals necessary such as the blood adoption and the cleansing for Harry which Dinah was adamant that he getAfter getting everything they needed and the Potter,Black,Peverell,Gryffindor and Prince Heir rings plus money they all went to get the school supplies the kids needed plus many books in regard to the magical community,laws,Magical lore,Hogwarts,etc. then the potions ingredients and cauldron which both kids were excited about much to the amusement of the adults and to Severus' delight finally they both went to get their wands"Ah mr. Potter I expected to see you today"an old man with pale silvery eyes and white skin said shocking both children who walked in alone "I remember your bearer's wand mr. Potter one of my finest works of art Black Walnut with a dragon heartstring core 11",very flexible your father, on the other hand, favoured a mahogany wand with Phoenix tail feather . Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favoured it — it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course""Ladies first"Harry said giving his sister a nudge"Ah now my dear which is your wand arm?" The man asked"I'm ambidextrous but my left hand is more dominant" Asvoria answered confused before a tape measure flew at her and started measuring her left arm after 4 wands a shattered window,broken shelves,a shattered vase and a whole in the ceiling Asvoria was presented with a wand that gave her a really wonderful feeling"Try this my dear Apple wood with Phoenix feather, 10 3/4", rigid flexibility"he said as he handed her a beautiful wand that almost seemed to jump into her hand and as soon as she held the wand and gave it a wave everything fixed themselves "Now for young mr. Potter""Thank you and sorry about the mess I've made"Harry said as he held his new wand which seemed to be one of the rarest one in the store if mr. Ollivander is to be believed since apparently he just got the wand from his friend in America mr. Mykew Gregorovitch. Snake wood with a Thestral Hair, 11 1/2" extreme flexibility"Oh no mr. Potter it is quite alright and besides you and your sister did repair and even clean my shop. Take these wand holsters as a gift of gratitude" Gerrick Ollivander said as he smiled at the children in front of him before they left to meet up with their parents, once they lady he looked at the Holly with Phoenix tail feather core wand in his hand and remembered how violently it reacted to the young man while it reacted the exact opposite to the young lady "How very odd and somehow I know that Albus will not like the fact that you did not choose the child"Most of the wands in this chapter are actually thought up by my cousin especially Regulus' wand since their is absolutely nothing on it,James Potter and Regulus Black's affair will surface during the story and yes they were both adopted by Severus who is Lord Prince. Also Harry's wand is something I kept thinking about and I just thought that snake wood would be so awesome for him but I threw in the Thestral tail hair because I just couldn't help it .Asvoria's wand is actually my wand in PottermoreI don't own Harry PotterAnd I will start warning you all that their will be bashing namely Dumbledore,Ronald,Ginny and Molly"Opo" is the respectful way of saying yes in Filipino cultureHama Yumi :This bow is said to be one of the oldest and most sacred Japanese weapons; the first Emperor Jimmu is always depicted carrying a bow. It is also called the evil banishing bow

August 28,1991LondonAs the White family enjoyed their last day together the two kids couldn't stop talking about the potions they learned to make under their mother's supervision and she had to admit despite the taste they work perfectly and instantly. Daniel was impressed by how much freer is son looked as if he was never with those monsters it made him smile everyday, Severus had also became a new uncle to the kids while Dinah seemed to be determined to see him healthy even going so far as to give him vaccinations for muggle ailments"I've been meaning to ask why didn't you ask about Asvoria having a magical core?"Daniel asked "I was quite frankly too shocked to think at the time""It's nothing really it's just I talked about everything that kept happening to us with tatay and he told me some about my mother about how she wasn't human. I honestly thought that he was just pulling my leg back then but now I want to know for Asvoria's sake"Dinah sighed before she closed her eyes just as her husband hugged her from behind"We'll visit him as soon as we're able then you can find everything out"Daniel said before they heard their kids ordering pizzaSeptember 1,1991Kings Cross Station,London"Both of you be careful!"Dinah scolded her children who were walking a little faster than they should "Poor Hedwig and Yuki are getting jostled!""Sorry mum"the children said before they stopped at the wall between platforms 9 and 10"Just walk through right?"Daniel asked before his son fell back into the wall"I guess so"Dinah sighed as she and her husband followed their daughter with Dan pushing Harry's trolley"Wow it's so red"Harry said at a loss for words making Asvoria laugh at him"Well isn't this a treat doctor White"a female voice said making them all turn to the left where they saw a square-jawed witch with close-cropped grey hair and a monocle. This gave her an appearance of being a serious person"Ms. Bones how has your leg been? No pains?"Dinah asked smiling at her ex patient"Yes quite alright now oh Susan dear this is Doctor Dinah White the nice muggle doctor who saved me during the first Wizarding war"Amelia said as a slightly chubby red haired girl stepped forward shyly"Well hello Susan it's wonderful to meet you this is my husband Daniel and these are my children Asvoria and Harrison" Dinah said smiling at the shy young girl"Hi!"the two said smiling before they heard the train whistle sound off signaling that they were about to depart "Bye mama,dad""Bye stay safe alright and write three times a week please" Dinah said as she hugged her children then kissed their cheeks"If you have any problems remember to approach your uncle"Daniel said before he let his son and daughter go and got their luggage into the trains compartment"I love you mama,dad you adopting me was the best thing that has ever happened to me"Harry said unknowingly made Dinah cry before giving them both watery kisses before they went on the train with Susan who introduced them both to Neville a shy pure blood who Harry likes immediately"And that is why you should never wake my sister up she can be a right dragon I swear she traumatized dad the first and only time he tried to wake her up"Harry told Neville while Asvoria taught Susan how to play Blackjack"Should I be scared?"Neville asked"No I don't think so"Harry said shrugging before a boy with slick back platinum blonde hair,silver eyes and pale skin opened their compartment door"Harrison"he said cool before Harry sat up and left the compartment"Wanna try our twin bond thing?" Harry thought and when Asvoria inclined her head he knew that their bond was working"My name is Draco Malfoy my mother told me about how you are Regulus Black's son which makes us family" the blonde said trying to sound cold and distant"Well I didn't know until our parents took us to Gringotts where I took an inheritance test and I was just as surprised and so was Tito Severus"Harry said smiling warmly at the blonde"Har Bear he's nervous because he has never met muggles before and you are nothing like how he imagined you to be and that's all on top of the new family relationship that was recently revealed. He wants to be your family,he's jealous of me because I'm already your family" Asvoria said through their link"Draco would you like to sit with us?"Harry offered smiling as he reached his hand out to the blonde "My sister would really like to meet you""Very well Harrison"Draco said looking to the sideOnce Harry introduced Draco to Susan,Asvoria and Neville it became evident that Susan and Neville didn't like or trust Draco causing a very awkward silence which lasted for about an hour before Asvoria finally snapped"For goodness sake you are all eleven year old but you act like you are already mortal enemies without any reason to. Neville I get that your nervous but Draco is just as nervous as you he isn't planning anything malicious he just wants to make real friends,Susan I get it your cautious because of how you were raised but don't you think your being a bit paranoid Draco isn't an enemy he's just like in a first year heading to Hogwarts" Asvoria snapped as she felt every emotion the other three were feeling for the past hour "Don't you dare feel amused Harrison or I swear that the next Marshall arts spar we have you'll be black and blue all over""How did she-?"Neville asked blushing along with Draco"My sister is an empath she can feel other people's true emotions and see their real intentions" Harry explained"But she's a Muggle-Born most don't have magical abilities"Susan said shocked and blushing in embarrassment"I may not be fully human"Asvoria shrugged before she got her sketch book out and began to draw as all three gaped at her before turning their attention to Harry"Mama said that their could be a possibility that her mother wasn't a human at all we just don't know what she means"Harry said shrugging"Oh hello dears anything from the trolley?" A kind looking elderly lady asked as she opens the compartment door"What would you guys recommend?" Harry asked"Cauldron cake,Blood pops,Chocolate Frog you may like those"Draco suggested getting a nod from both Susan and Neville"Sis?"Harry asked"Cauldron Cake I guess" Asvoria said shrugging"Are you sure these aren't real frogs covered in chocolate?"Harry asked Neville and Draco who both laughed but then nodded"They're just spelled to move Harry"Neville explains trying not to laugh at his new friend that was until a boy with bright ginger hair,hazel eyes with lots of freckles burst into their door glaring at Draco and making Asvoria stop her drawing to grab her brother in fear"Where is he Malfoy!?"he demanded"Who?"Draco said emotionlessly"Harry Potter my best friend where did you hide him you evil spawn!" He shouted until Harry with his hoodie up got between the two"Enough if you are done falsely accusing Draco and scaring my sister leave your poison emotions are not welcome here"Harry snarled readying his fist just in case"Is ickle wiwwle Ronnikins bullying Gred?"a mother voice asked"I believe he is Froge and scaring a lovely little lady shame" another said"YOU'RE SIDING WITH THE DEATH EATER!"The boy exclaimed before he turned around to come face to face with two very sharp looking scissors and two dead glares"Leave our compartment and listen to your brothers or else"Asvoria said darkly scaring the boy enough to wet himself and run away"You all alright?" Two identical gingers asked at the same time"Yeah thanks Fred,George guys these are the demon twins of Gryffindor Fred and George Weasley, Fred,George these are my new friends Draco Malfoy,Susan Bones,Asvoria White and Well Harrison Potter" Neville introduced smiling"Lovely to meet you all and sorry about Ron Malfoy he listens too much to our mum while we were taught by aunt Muriel about what your father did in the sidelines of the first war" The twins said in unison before looking at Harry "Heir Black-Potter best to stay away from our two younger sibling their spoiled brats that think of you as nothing more than a way to get money and fame fast just like our mum""Thank you for the warning would you two like some muggle candy?"Asvoria said smiling as she offered them some Hershey's bars,Reese's Peanut Butter Cups,Dove chocolate bars,Hershey's Cookies and Cream bars, War Heads,Starburst jelly beans, gummy candy,nerds,etc.Well that's the Hogwarts train and they're making friends yay!I'll introduce Hermione soon I just don't know howI don't own Harry PotterTito means uncle in TagalogTatay or Tay means father or dad in Tagalog

An:Sakura Lisel Thank you for pointing that out to me I'm sorry my math was off but In think I'll fix it as soon as possible thank you again .Once the Hogwarts Express stopped Asvoria and Harry followed their friends out of the train and headed over to the boats where a giant man was pointing at. Asvoria,Harry,Susan and Neville were in one boat while Draco went into the one next to theirs with his friend Blaise Zabini"Oh look!" Asvoria exclaimed excitedly upon seeing the castle "So majestic""Easy Ri you'll fall into the lake if you lean any closer"Harry said concerned and amused by his sister's excitement"Ok fine"Asvoria said pouting before she smiled when they got to the castle steps and got in with Draco"Wow this place is amazing"Harry said smiling"Oh I can't wait"Asvoria said smiling before she felt a wave of nervousness from her new friends "What's wrong?""Well-"Susan started before she was cut off by the arrival of Prof. McGonagall""Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.""What do you think the sorting ceremony is going to be?"Harry asked Neville and Draco"I don't known though I highly doubt that it's battling a troll we'd all be dead before anyone is sorted"Susan said she she heard the rude ginger from before"Maybe it's a magical object that can determine your strongest trait among the four treasured by the houses?" Asvoria suggested before she did a backflip to avoid a water balloon that a poltergeist had thrown at her "I think I like ghosts when they communicate through dreams and emotions""What?"Draco asked"Apparently muggle spirit that choose or are forced to stay here on Earth can communicate with people sensitive to energy or emotions like Asvoria here. We know that because of how many houses our grandparents own and several of them are well to put it frankly haunted"Harry said shrugging before prof. McGonagall escorted them all into the Great Hall in a single line while in front of them was an old looking hat and a stool in front of all the professors."Wouldn't it be funny if it would sing?"Harry whispered to his sister who giggled they both jumped in shock when it didOh you may not think I'm pretty,But don't judge on what you see,I'll eat myself if you can findA smarter hat than me.You can keep your bowlers black,Your top hats sleek and tall,For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting HatAnd I can cap them all.There's nothing hidden in your headThe Sorting Hat can't see,So try me on and I will tell youWhere you ought to be.You might belong inGryffindor,Where dwell the brave at heart,Their daring, nerve, and chivalrySet Gryffindors apart;You might belong inHufflepuff,Where they are just and loyal,Those patient Hufflepuffs are trueAnd unafraid of toil;Or yet in wise oldRavenclaw,if you've a ready mind,Where those of wit and learning,Will always find their kind;Or perhaps inSlytherinYou'll make your real friends,Those cunning folks use any meansTo achieve their ends.So put me on! Don't be afraid!And don't get in a flap!You're in safe hands (though I have none)For I'm a Thinking Cap."I hate my mouth sometimes" Harry groaned making Neville and Draco chuckle while Asvoria and Susan giggled at him"Once I call your name sit on the stool to be sorted"Prof. McGonagall said as she unrolled a piece of parchment "Hannah Abbott"By the end of the sorting 7 first years went to Gryffindor including Neville,12 into Ravenclaw including Harry and Asvoria, 8 into Hufflepuff including Susan and 8 into Slytherin including Draco. As Harry ate dinner he couldn't help but feel uncomfortable due to everyone looking at him"Don't worry most of the stares are mainly from curiosity but..."Asvoria said through their twin bond"But?""Several of the older Slytherins are looking at you in malice and well the headmaster isn't exactly friendly either his intentions are really darkand greedy" Asvoria said before she held Harry's hand in silent support "I don't like it one but""Have I eve told you that I love that your a walking lie detector" Harry said jokingly earning him a slap on the arm curtesy of his beloved sister"Well mom did have a minor freak out when I did the inheritance test after Tito Severus blood adopted us" Asvoria said grinningIt had just been a few minutes after Severus had blood adopted the White siblings when Goldfang Asvoria's account manager requested that she took an inheritance test of her ownAsvoria Divinagracia Bonifacio-White-PrinceDaniel Remus White FatherDinah Ligaya White nee Bonifacio MotherSeverus Tobias Prince Blood adopted Magical Guardian Titles:Secundarium Heredis PotterSecundarium Heredis PeverellHeiress PrinceBinibining Bonifacio Prinsesa ng BiringanLadyHeiress WhiteGifts:EmpathParseltongueMagical Twin Bond to Harrison James Black-PotterProtective Magic"Wait did our families have magic long before us?"Dinah asked in shock"It would seem so I assume that the White family must have been from another country we will look into it though I must say it is an honor to work for a princess to such an ambient magical city"Goldfang said bowing slightly to Asvoria "Anymore surprises?" Daniel asked hoping that no one would answer "Yes actually it seems as though LordHeir Potter is also descended from the Emrys and Le Fay lines though he can not inherit the Le Fay line due to his gender"Griphook said before Dinah fainted from all the shocking information given in one day"Though I do feel guilty for making mama faint"Harry said sheepishly"Yeah who knew that our blood held so much secrets"Asvoria said giggling before a very short professor walked over to Harry"Mr. Potter I am Filius Flitwick your head of house" the short professor greeted jovially"Oh hello professor how may I help you? And I would prefer my current name" Harry asked"Oh yes mr. White. The headmaster would like to see you in his office alone"he said making Asvoria feel anxious and it wasn't her own"Professor with all due respect he can say whatever he needs to say in front of my sister and magical guardian" Harry said not trusting the man that gave him to those monsters"Oh of course Severus has already told us about it. Trust me mr. White us heads know everything and we don't trust the headmaster as far as we can throw him"prof. Flitwick said smiling before both first years stood up and followed him making Susan,Neville and Draco worryOnce they arrived at the headmaster's office Harry noticed that his uncle was already there along with the other heads of houses then his eyes met the headmaster's to which he felt a prob at the back of his head like a thief trying to break into a maximum security prison"Whoever gifted us with protective magic thank you"Harry though as he gripped his sister's hand tightly needing the reassurance that he wasn't alone that she was there with him"Ah Harry my boy please do come in. Lemon drop?"the headmaster said completely ignoring Asvoria enraging Harry "How dare he Asvoria is a princess and he treats her like noting""Harry calm down its best that he doesn't know who I am and as touching as it is I don't need you playing knight in Black armor no pun intended"Asvoria said through their bond as Harry sat down on the chair Severus standing right behind him in silent support while Minerva did that same with Asvoria who was seated across from her brother"I must say I was rather distressed when I learned that you were kidnapped from your loving relatives"Albus Dumbledore said making both children stiffen"Forgive me headmaster but what loving relative would throw a child into a flaming burner?"Asvoria questioned as she pulled out her brother's case file and health records "My brother was not kidnapped my parents rescued him from abusive,repulsive and horrible people when he was four years old. It took two years for him to heal completely as he had several bones that repaired crookedly which had to be regrown and realigned,a year of powerful vaccines to make sure he didn't get any deadly mundane disease, a year of heavy multivitamins to combat his malnutrition and even after all that he is still anemic and on occasion asthmatic""Don't forget four years of psychological and psychosocial therapy"Harry grumbled darkly not noticing that all the other heads of houses were looking at Dumbledore in shock,rage and disappointment"Yes well they have changed and you need their protection"Dumbledore said sounding like an upset grandfather but Asvoria sensed the rage and narcissism rolling off the man in waves"No Albus Harry is my godson and my Secundarium Heredis I am responsible for him"Severus said practically growled actually"Now Severus Lily would have wanted Petunia to raise her son"he said making Minerva and Severus growl"Funny because mr. White's inheritance test say that he is the son of James Potter and Regulus Black blood adopted by Lily Potter nee Evans. Regulus was my best friend and I'll be damned if I let his son be abused"Severus said as he pulled Harry and Asvoria up and led them out "I will no longer be your little puppet Albus and neither will my Heiress and Secundarium Heredis"When the pair got to Ravenclaw tower they were greeted by a prefect named Roger Davis who showed them their rooms and introduced Harry to his room mate Terry Boot whirl explaining to Asvoria that she'll have her room all to herself until next year when she get to where her room with a lower year"May I inquire where I can find a copy of the Hogwarts charter?"Asvoria asked sweetly"Of course it's in the common room library here I'll show you" Roger said as he led Asvoria into the common room and got the book for her"Thank you"she said sweetly before she took the book to a vacant couch and started reading it as Harry walked over to her"Well I made a friend"Harry said grinning"Mabuti naman para sayo.Sino siya?" Asvoria asked without taking her eyes off her book"Pangalan niya ay Terry Boot mabait naman siya ewan ba kung magapatuloy ba yan"Harry said as he pulled out his potions book"Magingat ka kung sino an kakaibiganin mo alam mo naman may mga plastic na tao sa mundo" Asvoria said looking at a group of older girls who kept leering at Harry"Salamat na man na binigyan tayo ni tito ng mga singsing niya"Harry said smiling before he yawned "Well night sis Love ya""Night love you too" she said as he kissed her forehead and she kissed his cheek in returnWell both Whites are in Ravenclaw and they've met Dumbledore not to mention protective heads of houses and everything else will be explained as the story goes on.I don't own Harry PotterFilipino EnglishMabuti naman para sayo.Sino siya?Good for you. Who is he?Pangalan niya ay Terry Boot mabait naman siya ewan ba kung magpapatuloy ba yanHis name is Terry Boot he's nice but I don't know if that'll continue Magiingat ka kung sino an kakaibiganin mo alam mo naman may mga plastic na tao sa mundoBe careful on who you make friends with their are plastic people in the worldSalamat sa Dyos na binigyan tayo ni tito ng mga singsing niyaThank God that uncle gave us his rings 

September 2,1991HogwartsThe next day Asvoria and Harry made their way down to the Great Hall carrying both their mundane and magical books on their way to breakfast along with Terry Boot and Su Li a Ravenclaw who Asvoria noticed was rather withdrawn"What's with all the books?"Terry asked as he looked through Harry's books"Oh were still taking our muggle classes" Harry answered as he reached out for several pancakes and bacon"Our mother is a well-respected doctor in the muggle world who had several clinics all over the world, a major fashion line and several resorts and hotel chains while our father used to be in the royal air force and is now a well-respected archeologist. Thus many people in the muggle world have high expectations for us and despite our parents telling us not to mind them we kinda can't afford to slack off because we are sorta well known in the muggle world due to our charity works, several songs we wrote, us being slightly famous sports stars and us acting in several movies" Asvoria said exhausted before pulling out her algebra work"Not to mention we also have the excellent talent of learning a language in three months," Harry said smiling slyly before he saw Neville, Susan, and Draco and waved them over"Had a goodnight, Harry?"Neville asked smiling"Yup mostly because Terry's snoring isn't as loud as our grandfather's, "Harry said before Asvoria reached over to slap him on the shoulder"Be nice" Asvoria said when she saw Terry glare at Harry but she didn't sense any malice if anything he was amused"That was nice," Harry remarked glaring at her as she went back to her work"How can you understand any of this?"Draco asked Harry when he read over his Russian paperwork"Eh Russian is an interesting language" Harry shrugged before their head of house gave them their time tables"Mr. and Ms. White in regards to your mundane education you may use the abandoned classroom near Ravenclaw Tower I will have house-elves clean it," Prof. Flitwick said smiling at the two "I will also include items for your physical activities""Thank you, professor," the White siblings said smiling at the short man"Come on Susan we have potions first, "Asvoria said as she gathered her things before Harry took them making Asvoria look at him incredulously"What?"Harry asked her with a smirk"I don't know if you want to be a gentleman or your just making me forget my threat about turning you black and blue all over, "Asvoria said before she took Susan's hand before dragging her out of the Great Hall"I am both blessed and cursed to have someone as strong and affectionate as Ria as a sister"Harry grumbled before following after her as Neville, Terry, Su, and Draco all chuckled at him before both ravens ran after themAs Susan and the other Ravens got to the dungeons Severus greeted them by telling them what to expect from him including his strict rules in his class"Makes sense this class can kill people so messing around isn't something we want to do, "Asvoria remarked as she sat between to Su and Susan while Harry and Terry sat behind them snd were soon joined by another Hufflepuff named Wayne Hopkins"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word. It was as if Severus had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. "As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death—if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach. Mr. White, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?""The Draught of Living Death sir" Harry answered confidently but most students didn't notice too shocked at their teacher addressing the Boy-Who-Live by the wrong name"Correct 5 points to Ravenclaw. Ms. Bones where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?""In the stomach of a goat sir"Susan answered getting smiles from both Asvoria and Su"Mr. Boot, What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?""Monkswood and Wolfsbane are the same plant sir they also go by Aconite" Terry answers tankful that Harry told him to study for potions just in case"Anything to add ms. White?""In the muggle world Wolfsbane gets its name for being the poison used to kill carnivores such as wolves and panthers, in the 18th century (Aggrawal 2009), it was put into raw meat to bait the animals (Blaisdell 1995). Some believed that it was even aconite that caused rabies in these animals later on because of its horrifying side effects (Blaisdell 1995). Aconite shows up all across history. In Greece, it was thought to have been one of the first poisons ever created, in Rome, it was used to poison enemies, it was even used by Shakespeare as a deadly weapon for an aconite covered blade in "Hamlet" (Aggrawal 2009). These are just a few of the gruesome events that took place in aconite's past. In ancient Chinese culture, aconite, along with other plants, was used to poison arrows (Chakravarty and D. Chakravarti 1954). It was also thought that aconite's deadly powers were used by Nazi scientists to poison bullets (Stewart 2009)" Asvoria answered smiling as all her classmates gaped at her while Harry looked amused"Good work Ms. Bones, Mr. Boot, and Ms. White and I am pleased to see several of you were bright enough to write everything down. 10 points to Ravenclaw and 5 points to Hufflepuff. Now write down the instructions on the board you will be brewing a simple cure for boils who you are sitting with will be your partners for the entire year"Severus said before heading to his deskAfter Asvoria wrote the instructions down on her parchment she read over it two times before she got up and got their required tools as Su and Susan got the ingredients needed"Let's see horned slugs, porcupine quills, and snake fangs hmmm first step is to add 6 Snake Fangs to your mortar then crush them into a fine powder using your mortar. I'll crush these up could you set up the cauldron Su""Sure," Su said while Susan lit up the burner just as the boys started on their potion"Add 4 measures of the crushed fangs to your cauldron the heat of the mixture had to be 250 degrees for 10 seconds. Wave your wand. Leave to Brew since were using a copper cauldron we should just leave it to brew for about 60 seconds" Asvoria said as Susan stopped waving her wand"Next is to add 4 horned Slugs," Susan said as she added the slugs one at a time "Now 2 porcupine quills""After that, we stir 5 times clockwise then wave a wand over the cauldron to complete the potion," Asvoria said before she felt someone behind her"Wonderful work ladies I see that I have three fewer dunderheads in my class. 8 points to Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff" Severus said pleased with his heiress who seemed to be quite the potions mistress in the makingAfter the class, three groups were exempted from the three-foot essay about the potion the three groups being Asvoria's, Harry's, and the team of Padma Patil, Anthony Goldstein, and Megan JonesAfter Potions, Harry and Asvoria made their way to charms with the Gryffindors where they saw Neville who was talking to a bushy-haired girl both seemed to be very upset"Hey Nev what's wrong?"Harry asked making the girl turn to them"Ronald Weasley he pushed Hermione here and told her some really mean thing he um, "Neville said hesitantly"What did he say, Nev?"Asvoria asked worried for her new friend"He said that his parents were weak pathetic cowards that deserve what happened to them"the girl Hermione said in a whisper"Don't worry you two he is just an asshole who needs to be brought down a peg or two now how about we go into class and sit together" Harry offered a smile as he took Neville's arm while Asvoria took Hermione's who smiled slightly"Strange Professor McGonagall isn't here yet, "Asvoria said as she looked around the room only to see a silver tabby who looked like she was wearing spectacles "But her cat if here""What are the chances that that her?"Harry asked before they all just greeted the cat not caring if they looked weird greeting a cat before taking their seats"I swear my mouth is cursed or something" Harry grumbled as professor McGonagall shifted back into her human form as Asvoria giggled at him"Well at least we decided to greet her properly instead of petting her," she said still snickering"Now let's just turn this match into a needle," Harry said before he started thinking back to all of Severus' pre-Hogwarts lessons "Concentrated, Transfiguration is one of the hardest forms of magic master Minerva taught me that it helps when you visualize the transition""Oh well-done Mr. and Ms. White ten points to Ravenclaw for excellent spell work" professor McGonagall praised the siblings for their amazing spell workAfter their magical educational the siblings took their new friends into the abandoned classroom professor Flitwick told them bout, where two house-elves pleased several snacks for them all"Thank you," Asvoria said smiling at the little creatures who got teary eyes from the simple thank you before popping away"What was that?" Hermione inquired confused"A house-elf" Draco responded"What is a house-elf?" Hermione asked again" House-elf is a magical being that is immensely devoted and loyal to the one designated as their master." Neville explained"It sounds like slavery, " Hermione said slightly horrified by the idea"Not really, you see Hermione house-elves need the magic of their masters it's kind of like mutualism the elves get the magic they need while the wizard or witch has a little helper but yes it is akin to slavery in some ways but Tito told us that if your house-elf is happy they would do anything for you, " Harry said smiling as his sister sat at one of the desks and began to writeTheir group is getting largerThe next chapter is probably Halloween and soon Harry is going to get a special messageI don't own Harry Potter

September 12,1991Quidditch FieldOn a bright sunny day, Asvoria and Harry found themselves outside waiting for their flying lesson while trying to calm down Susan, Padma, and Su who looked ready to pass out"You'll be okay don't worry too much, " Asvoria said trying to calm the three-down it didn't help that several boys were teasing them only to be shut up by Asvoria glaring at them"Good morning everyone" Madam Rolanda Hooch greeted as she walked to the front of the students her piercing golden eyes staring at every one of her students "Now to start this lesson I would just like to warn you lot about messing about, now step up to your brooms, hold your hand out and say up!""Up!" both Asvoria and Harry said, at the same time making their brooms shoot into their hands"Cool," Harry said as she smiled at his sister who was also grinningOnce everyone had a firm grip on their brooms they were all asked to kick off the ground and hover for a few minutes before landing back down but Padma's broom went crazy sending her all over the place and without thinking Asvoria and Harry flew up to try and get her off her broom and set her safely on the ground but at the last minute just as they were close enough to reach her she fell making both Whites swoop down and catch her"Mr. and Ms. White!" Madam Hooch exclaimed as they were placing Padma on the ground "Wonderful work saving Ms. Patil but you two still disobeyed my orders. 10 points from Ravenclaw but 16 points for saving your fellow student"At lunch what the White sibling did had become the topic of the whole Great Hall making the siblings extremely annoyed especially when Weasley tried to sit with Harry pushing Asvoria to the floor in the process, only to have her kick the back of his knees making him tumble to the floor"Idiota egoísta egocéntrico" Asvoria grumbled glaring darkly at the ginger as she dusted herself off"彼を最後の脳細胞に任せてください," Harry said as he also glared at the idiotic ginger"Welche Gehirnzellen ich bin mir ziemlich sicher, dass es dort eine leere Dose ist" Asvoria grumbled"Ay, dili ko kamao naa man jud koy utok" Harry answered shrugging just as professor Flitwick approached them with an older Raven"Ah, Mr. And Ms. White this is Roger Davis our Quidditch team captain" he greeted happily "Roland happily told me about how you saved Ms. Patil and so I thought that you two would be our perfect seekers for next year. That is if you are willing""Sure seems fun" Harry chimed in while Asvoria nodded along with a smile on her face"Great your first practice will be next Saturday I'll take you to the pitch myself," Roger said smiling for next year "Next year we finally have a chance at winning the Quidditch cup"October 31, 1991Hogwarts, Charms ClassroomIt was Charms with Ravenclaw and Gryffindors when it happened. Asvoria, Su, Padma, and Hermione we're happily practicing the Lumos charm while Terry and Harry we're helping Neville with the charms when Hermione decided to try and help Ronald Weasley who rudely told her to shove off in the rudest way possible making Hermione cry and him getting slapped from all three female ravens who went to chance after their friendDuring the Halloween feast Percy, Fred, and George walked up to Harry and apologized for what Ronald did to Hermione"You shouldn't be the ones apologizing," Harry said softly "What's his problem anyway?""He's a spoiled little brat like our younger sister our mum doesn't deny them anything" Percy explains"Let me guess he sees me as nothing more than a means to an end he sees the Boy Who Lived" Harry sighed before smiling at them "Don't worry I hate your brother but not you three""You are such a nice guy" Terry joked prompting Harry to punch him on the arm"Let's just go to our table," Harry said as he walked over to the Ravenclaw table only to see Su and Padma but his sister wasn't there "Where's Asvoria?""She's still with Hermione in the second-floor girl's bathroom. Last we saw Hermione was having what Asvoria called a panic attack because she's scared that Weasley was right and we weren't her real friends" Padma said sadly"I think we should tell Neville he looks like he's ready to explode from worry," Terry said before he walked over to the Gryffindor tableHalfway through the feast professor Quirrell ran into the Great Hall shouting something about a troll in the dungeons"Prefects lead the students back to their dorms!"Dumbledore commanded making Harry freeze"ARE YOU CRAZY! YOU'RE MAKING THE SLYTHERINS WALK TO THEIR DEATHS!"Terry shouted in disbelief"The Hufflepuff common rooms are also near where the troll is"Harry exclaimed making all four heads look at Dumbledore in horror as the realization dawned on them"Students stay in the Great Hall Prefects count all the students"Professor McGonagall commanded which was when Harry felt fear from his sister"Professor Asvoria and Hermione aren't here," Neville said to his head of the houseMeanwhile, Asvoria had just finished calming Hermione down when a foul odor entered their senses making them look up to see a huge smelly and ugly troll looming over themwith its club raised"Hermione run!"Asvoria screamed as she pushed Hermione away from the club swinging towards them"Why is there a troll here?"Hermione asked scared as Asvoria raised her wand ready to defend herself and Hermione"I don't know but we have to be careful, "Asvoria said before doing a backflip to avoid that blasted club"Wingardium Leviosa" Hermione cast as she levitated the club over the troll's head then dropping it only for it to bounce off the troll's head making it angry, it grabbed its club again and walked towards Hermione and Asvoria who had just reached her friend"Harry, Tito Sev anyone please help us," Asvoria thought desperately as the troll lifted its club intent on killing them only for a bright light to launch itself from Asvoria's magical core towards the troll. Halfway to the troll light became large birds made of shimmering red, blue, gold, and white energies circling it making a tornado surrounding the foul creature seemingly sucking out all of its air, no more than a minute passed it laid dead while Asvoria was slumped against a crying Hermione who tried desperately to wake her up"Asvoria please wake up please" Hermione begged not even noticing that teachers arrived until Minerva touched her shoulder and proceeded to force her cub to let go of her friend so that Severus could take her"Hermione dear what happened?"Minerva asked gently as she guided her cub to the hospital wing"I-I-I'm so sorry professor I-I was so upset because Ronald Weasley bullied me a-and Asvoria, Su and Padma followed me here t-then I had a panic attack then the troll, "Hermione said before crying hysterically"Oh dear Poppy we need a Calming Draught, "Minerva said as she placed Hermione on the bed nearest to where Severus laid Asvoria"What happened Minerva?"Poppy Pomfrey asked seeing the distressed faces of the teachers"These two were not in the Great Hall for the Halloween feast it turns out that ms. Granger was having a panic attack and ms. White aided her they were found by the troll and somehow they managed to kill it" Filius said looking pale"Asvoria's magic" Hermione whimpered as she looked at her friend"What was that my dear?"Pomona asked"When the t-troll cornered us she-her magic shot four birds at the troll which then made a tornado around it sucking out all its air. She was unconscious when it happened I-I was so scared that I-" Hermione whimpered close to tears again"Rest ms. Granger, I will inform Mr. White and Mr. Longbottom about your condition" Severus said before leaving the hospital wingThe next morning Harry and Neville went to the hospital wing the first chance they got accompanied by Susan and Draco who was equally worried for the two muggleborns"I don't know what it is Albus I have never seen this type of magic" the voice of madam Poppy Pomfrey sounded out and she sounded irritated"Surely you should know Poppy. She is a first-year and a muggleborn she should not have been able to kill that troll and her magic could help the light" Dumbledore said making all four first years growl"ENOUGH! Ms. White and Ms. Granger both need rest I will not let you interrupt that"Madam Pomfrey said before they saw Dumbledore run out of the hospital wing "Come in children""Is my sister alright?" Harry asked worried as he saw his paler than usual sister just laying on her bed"Yes she is magically exhausted but otherwise fine," the medi-witch said smiling softly "Go on but do be mindful of the fact that your sister and Ms. Granger need rest and lot of it""Thank you," Harry and Neville said softly before they sat on the chairs next to the beds"Hello you lot"they heard Fred or George greet turning back they saw the ginger haired twins carrying flowers"For the loveliest ladies and heroes of Hogwarts""Thanks guys"Harry said smiling as he took the flowers and placed them in the vase near his sister's bed while Neville did the same with Hermione's"How did a troll get into Hogwarts? Aren't there protections against them?" Susan asked both angered and worried at the state of her friends"My father will hear about this"Draco grumbled not liking how weak Asvoria looked"And thats not even counting the Hogwarts rumour mill"Neville said as he looked at his best friend in Gryffindor"Oh Asvoria is not going to like that" Harry bemoaned"I don't like it at all"a quiet voice said startling everyone"How are you feeling?" Harry asked"Tiered by intact and well enough, How's Hermione is she alright?" Asvoria asked trying to sit up"Oh no you dont""Madam Pomfrey will""Have our heads""If we let you of of bed""Correct misters Weasley" the medi witch said as she walked over to Asvoria "Gave us quite the fright ms. White""Is she alright?" Susan asked as the older witch ran a diagnostic charm on Asvoria"Yes she is in fact she will be back to full health in no time though you will have to stay here until lunch" Poppy said smiling softly at the muggleborn"And Hermione?" Neville asked"She will be allowed to leave as soon as she wakes up" she said before her smile became a stern expression "Now off with you lot breakfast is being served right now don't want to miss it"As they all had breakfast at the Ravenclaw table Draco noticed that Harry was barely ate anything except a piece of toast and one piece of bacon"Harrison Daniel White if your sister found out that you didn't eat anything more than a piece of toast and bacon she'll hang you" Susan scolded before turning to Hermione who was just toying with her food she was just about to scold her to when a girlish scream caught their attention looking towards the Gryffindor table they all saw Ronald Weasley trying to run away from a pink and blue fuzzy stuffed spider who was repeating the words "Love me" over and over again this caused many of the students to laugh at him especially the Slytherins and Gryffindors"Les jumeaux ont fait un travail formidable" Draco said whispered to Harry who looked much happierHalloween done!I don't own Harry PotterTranslation :Language EnglishIdiota egoìsta egocēntricoSpanishSelfish Self-centred idiot彼を最後の脳細胞に任せてくださいJapaneseJust leave him to his last brain cellsWelche Gerhirnzellen ich bin mir ziemlich sicher, dass es dort leere Dose istGermanWhat brain cells I'm pretty sure that its an empty can in thereAy, dili ko kamao naa man jud koy utokFilipino(Bisaya)I don't know I have a brainLes jumeaux ont fait un travail formidableFrenchThe twins did a wonderful job

November 9, 1991Quidditch FieldAs Asvoria and Harry were making their way to the field with their friends Terry, Padma, and Su Harry noticed that the Roger was running up to them looking extremely winded"Roger are you alright?"Harry asked while Asvoria just tilted her head to the side in confusion"You two need to sit with the team," Roger said panting in between word hunched over"Why?"Asvoria asked confused"You need to understand the workings of a seeker what better than with people who can accurately answer all your questions" Roger answered as he tries to stand properly"Ugh you guys don't mind right?" Asvoria asked looking at her friends"Go we'll tell the others," Terry said grinning as the girls nodded behind him"Thanks guys, " Harry said before Roger took them both to the stand where the sat"About to start" Asvoria stated as Madam Hooch called both Quidditch team Captains over"Is Madam Hooch always the referee?" Harry asked"Most of the games she is but when she's unavailable another teacher steps in" Roger explains as Madam Hooch asks all the player to mount their broomsAfter the players had taken off, she released the Quaffle, which was immediately taken by Gryffindor Chaser Angelina Johnson, who passed it to fellow Chaser Alicia Spinnet; Alicia passed it back before the Quaffle was taken by Flint. He tried to score, but Wood blocked the Quaffle, which was taken by Katie Bell. Katie was hit by a Bludger and lost it to Slytherin player Adrian Pucey, but he in turn was blocked by the second Bludger, hit at him by Fred Weasley or George Weasley. Johnson regained possession of the Quaffle, and with a clear field, dodged another Bludger, shot the Quaffle past Slytherin Keeper Bletchley, and scored first for Gryffindor. Johnson, who passed it to fellow Chaser Alicia Spinnet; Alicia passed it back before the Quaffle was taken by Flint. He tried to score, but Wood blocked the Quaffle, which was taken by Katie Bell. Katie was hit by a Bludger and lost it to Slytherin player Adrian Pucey, but he in turn was blocked by the second Bludger, hit at him by Fred Weasley or George Weasley. Johnson regained possession of the Quaffle, and with a clear field, dodged another Bludger, shot the Quaffle past Slytherin Keeper Bletchley, and scored first for Gryffindor."Is it always this intense?" Asvoria asked Roger"No that's just how Gryffindors and Slytherins are against each other" Brennan Doyle was a Keeper of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team said"Huh? What's that shiny thing?"Asvoria and Harry asked at the same time while pointing towards the teacher's stand"Well look at that they saw the snitch and they're not even playing loads better than Chang already" Grant Page the Keeper said grinningShortly after, Pucey was once again in possession of the Quaffle, dodging two Bludgers, when suddenly both Seekers noticed the Snitch. They soared downwards, the rest of the match frozen to watch; Potter was faster than Slytherin Seeker Higgs and nearly caught the Snitch, but Flint rammed into him, fouling him and losing the Snitch. Hooch gave Gryffindor a penalty shot and Alicia Spinnet scored, making it 20 to 0. When the Gryffindor Seeker dodged a Bludger that nearly hit his head, he noticed that he was suddenly losing control over his broomstick. Thinking that he was falling, grabbed it with his hands and knees; it was trying to buck him off, zig-zagging wildly through and towards Harry."Harry! Look out!"Asvoria exclaimed before she pushed Harry to the ground just as the Seeker zoomed passed them"You two alright?"Roger asked before he and the rest of the team formed a protective circle around the two"I think so," Harry said shaken as Asvoria held him tight also shakenWhile the Gryffindor Seeker was having difficulties with his broom, Flint was in possession of the Quaffle; he was hit in the face with a Bludger but was still able to score, making it 20 to 10. Eventually, the other spectators began to notice the odd behavior of Harry's broom; he was thrown off of it when it gave an almighty jerk and was left dangling from it with one hand meanwhile, it was becoming increasingly difficult for the Gryffindor Seeker to hang on to his broom. Fred and George tried to pull him onto one of their Cleansweep Fives, but failed to do so; Flint scored five goals without anyone noticing, making the score now 20 to 60."What's going on?" Harry asked a bit better but still held on to his sister"Someone must have cursed the broom kiddie" Jason Samuel a Chaser said as he continuously cast a protection charm"Looks like the Slytherin Seeker saw the Snitch"Duncan Ingebee a beater said as Asvoria looked up only to see her uncle Severus and head of house making their way towards them"Mr. and Ms. White lets get you out and to safety, "Severus said as he escorted his heiress and Secundarium Heredis out of the stadiumOnce the White siblings were safe the Gryffindor Seeker finally got back control of his broom and the match resumed without any other problem meanwhile Severus had taken Asvoria and Harry to his private quarters and checked them over for any injuries"Were fine Tito Sev promise, " Harry mumbled as Severus ran diagnostics spell on him"I assure you Harrison I am doing this for my benefit I will not have that mother of yours turn me into a pin cushion again" Severus sneered making the two children giggle "And before I forget Asvoria you will be receiving lady training from a dear friend of mine on Saturday after your muggle studies morning and Harrison the Black account manager has finally opened the vault your bearer set up for you. He found this chest""What are these?"Harry asked as Asvoria looked at the chest containing several vails filled with a silvery-white liquid curiously"These are memories it seems that Regulus wanted you to understand several events from his perspective. There is also a letter at the bottom" Severus said his voice almost emotionless in tone but Asvoria felt deep sadness from the man"Huh? I wonder what Mr. Regulus was to Tito?" Asvoria thought as she watched them both"What was my dad, Regulus like? Did you know him? Were you close?" Harry asked as he held the chest closely"Regulus Arcturus Black was the perfect Slytherin to most people but to me, he was a Raven in the Snake's Pit always having his nose in a book, wanting to learn everything especially Ruins, Rituals, and Spell Crafting. An annoying brat that always made it his mission to interrupt me when I study and overall my best friend...my only real friend actually" Severus said his eyes showing fondness, sadness, joy, nostalgia, and regret. The strength of each emotion made Asvoria dizzy "After Lily Evans walked out of my life without a second thought he kept me in the light, he led me away from hate, he did his darned best to make sure that I became a real Lord, Funny how he even gave you the name I playfully told him was the name I chose for my future son. Nonetheless, I am so happy that I get to see his oh so endearing personality in you every day""Professor will-um-can I"Harry stuttered as his eyes grew watery "Will you please tell me about my dad Regulus I want to get to know him""I believe the best person to aid you in that would be your grandfather Orion Harrison. I believe that his magical portrait" Severus said making both children tilt their heads in confusion "It is a tradition for witches and wizards of note to sit for portraits, so their legacy can be retained long after they've passed. According to the letter Regulus kept for me your grandfather had one made when you were born to guarantee that he can watch over you if an event as tragic as Regulus' death was to occur. He wrote about how your grandfather was smitten with you when he first held you. I believe he placed several pictures in your chest as well""Thank you tito Sev for everything," Harry said hugging the man as Asvoria smiled at them happy that her brother had something from his real parent"You're welcome brat now I believe that it is time for you to head back to your tower, your friends must be worried""Thanks again tito. You know if I didn't have dad, I would have wished that you were my birth father instead of James" Harry said as he walked out of the classroom"He is most certainly your son Regulus," Severus thought chuckling as he went to his desk and finished grading potions essaysDecember 12,1991Great HallOn the morning of Asvoria's birthday Harry,Terry and their other friends were all waiting for Asvoria who was walking to the Great Hall with Su and Padma. Harry was holding a delicious looking triple chocolate cake that was designed to look like a galaxy"Oh here she comes" Hermione said excitedly making everyone else who were in the Great Hall look at the first years stationed at the door in curiosity,amusement and a few raised eyebrows"Why do my eyes need to be blindfolded Su?"Asvoria asked as she was being guided by Padma and Su towards the Great Hall"Because"Padma said before giggling"Almost there Now!""Happy Birthday!" Hermione,Neville,Terry,Susan,Fred,Geroge,Padma and Su all shouted holding up wrapped presents while Harry just walked over and kissed his sisters cheek while holding the cake he made thanks to Susan showing him the kitchens and Professor Sprout giving him permission"Aww thank you that is every sweet of you guys" Avsoria said smiling and blushing"Happy Birthday to the prettiest firsty in the school"Fred and George exclaimed making their little group and a few older students laughSoon they all made their way to the Ravenclaw table where Asvoria blew out her candle,opened her presents and shared a good laugh with her friendsDecember 25, 1991Biliran Province, Visayas Region, Philippines"It's nice to have you both back," Andres Crisostomo Bonifacio said as he hugged his grandchildren"Glad to be back Lolo," Harry said grinning widely"Lolo what's your plan for this Christmas?" Asvoria asked as Dinah and Daniel carried their bags inside the two-story house with a fantastic beach from across from a private island"The usual prepare Noche Buena and you can tell me all about your new school, Sabi ng mama niyo na nageenjoy daw kayo doon" Andres said smiling"Opo Lolo Its so much fun" Asvoria said as she smiled happily"Good because after lunch well head to the restaurant to see your cousins""Nan dito palang si Aleia pa?Sa busy ng bunso ko akala ko doon pasiya sa Canada" Dinah said smiling at the thought of her younger sister"Alam mo na man yung bunso mo palaging nagkakaroon ng oras para satin at hindi mo ba alam may nanliligaw na sa kanya magkakaroon na ng daddy si baby Althea" Andres said making everyone laugh"Well thats good that sister of yours is too mich of a workaholic sometimes" Daniel said before the door opened"I missed you too Danny"a light and airy voice said making everyone turn around to see a woman who looked like Dinah except she was paler and shorter holding a baby girl with purple eyes who was looking around curiously"Bunso so good of you to join us"Dinah said as she walked up to her sister and hugged her"Salamat Ate and Im so sorry I've just been so busy"Aleia said smiling as she gave her baby over to her sister"Tita Aleia!"Harry and Asvoria exclaimed as they ran over to the woman"Oh my god you two are getting so much bigger" Aleia said smiling before she kissed the top of their heads"Oh sige na pumunta na tayo sakusina para makasimula na tayo makapanluto ng noche buena" Andres said smilingThat night as they all sat near the Christmas tree after eating a full and delicious meal, Andres who was dressed up like Santa Claus gave everyone their gifts starting with the children"Wow this is great! New drawing supplies" Asvoria gushed when she saw her present"And these skates are fantastic" Harry said as he lifted up his new roller blades"We have more gifts for you two though it will have to be for tomorrow morning oh and your friends sent you gifts too" Dinah said as she handed eighth presents to her children"Aww how sweet" Aleia cooed as she held her daughter who was playing with the wrapping paper instead of her actual gift"Oh Hermione got me a book about magi zoology, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them by Newt Scamander" Asvoria gushed as she hugged her new book"Hahahaha Neville had such big ears as a baby aww" Harry said smiling before his fave turned into that of awe "Wow Professor McGonagall played with us ad babies""Before I forget I got these in Aurora Alley in Canada" Aleia said before handing her special gifts to her nephew and niece "Carlos said that those are books on Enchantment and Warding I thought you two would find it interesting""Carlos?"Harry asked"Papa!!!!"Althea squealed happily"Hahaha Carlos is an Auror I am currently dating and he was also the one to save Althea here when her parents died in an accident" Aleia said as she hugged her daughter closerThe next morning the whole family went into a van with Daniel driving to pick up Carlos from the Tacloban City Airport and then they were off to the surprise the adults had for the two eleven year olds. After 5 hours they finally stopped and got out"Where are we?" Asvoria asked curiously"Biringan City I thought that you'd like to buy a few magical things before you head back to school" Andres said smiling as the gates opened for them all. The kids had a blast there getting to learn so many different thing and buying magical gifts for their friends back in England even visiting a wand maker their lolo personally knew and getting back up wands and a basilisk skin wand holster and boots"Where did you get the scales from?" Asvoria asked Melchora the wand maker and dueling specialist"Galing sa alaga kong Basilisks, Parseltounge Ako kasi iha, Alam mo iha ang mga tao sa Europa a naniniwala na masama ang relgalong ito pero mali sila and regalong ito ay ubud na ispecial at kapaki-pakinabang" Melcora said making both children smileYey Im done with this chapter and also I think I need a beta soon because I have online classes and work sheets to work onI dont own Harry PotterTagalog EnglishSabi ng mama niyo na nageenjoy daw kayo doonyour mom said that your enjoying yourselves thereOpo LoloYes GrandpaNan dito palang si Aleia pa?Sa busy ng bunso ko akala ko doon pasiya sa CanadaOh so Aleia is already here?

Let's go" Neville said as he guided the two to where their friends were"And here they are"Fred said"The siblings of the hour"George continued"How were your holidays?" Hermione asked smiling"Fun, the Philippines is different to England in terms of them being more open to all types of magic" Harry said as he sat next to Neville"And our mama made presents for all of you guys" Asvoria said smiling widely as she got out wrapped boxes in the color of their individual houses one metallic green, one gold and four metallic red"Wow a varsity jacket that has our house insignia on the back" Hermione said before getting up and hugging them before she marveled at her new gift. The Gryffindor jackets were a mellow red with light grey sleeves and the big golden Gryffindor insignia on the back and a smaller on on the left side in the front"It's very comfortable" Draco said smiling as he hugged trailed his hands over the material of the jacket. The Slytherin hoodie was green with white sleeves and had a big silver Slytherin insignia on the back and a smaller on on the left side in the front"Your mother made these?" Susan asked in awe.

To Fred,George,Neville and Hermione they gave white bracelets woth red pearls which looked like it had fire swirling in side it, For Draco a dark grey bracelet with its pearl looking like it had a mini ocean in it. For Susan a bright yellow bracelet its pearl looked like it had a living flower in it and for themselves a royal blue bracelet with a projection of a powerful typhoon in the pearl"Well then I believe it is my turn for gifts" Draco said as he passed around everyone's gifts.

Padma gushed as she held up her new dress adoringly. The dress had a 3/4 reglan sleeve, semi-circle knee length skirt and a little light purple sash that acted like a belt, it was also light blue with golden embroidery around the hem of the skirt and sleeves that looked like peacock feathers and silver lotus flowers"Yeah it started as a hobby but then became a business because of how many people love her designs" Asvoria answered smiling at how her mom knew just what to make for her friends"It is beautiful thank you" Su said in awe at her dress, It was a teal long that also had 3/4 reglan sleeve, semi-circle knee length skirt but this was like a Qipao, it also had jasmines embroidered around the waist area, hem of the skirt and along the collar"I like mine too thanks" Terry said admiring the shirts he got"You're welcome" Harry said smirkingThat night as Harry was just about to go to bed after reading his new book on protective magic a house elf popped into the room"Oh hello what can I do for you?"Harry asked the little creature as he placed his book down, the house elf just placed the gift on his bed then popped out "What was that all about?""Whats that mate?" Terry asked as he walked out of the bathroom"I don't know what it is"Harry said as he reached out for it only for his bracelet to tighten and the wind inside the pearl to strengthen "It has compulsion charms on it huh? I'll probably have to tell tito Sev about this tomorrow""Well night Harry"Terry said as he went to bed"Night"Harry replied as he set the gift off to the side and drew the curtains around his bed, placed up a silencing ward that Melchora taught him then pulling out his enchanted mirror and poured the first memory over the mirrorWhen the memory was in the mirror Harry tapped its surface with his wand and his reflection immediately changed to that of the Hogwarts halls where a younger looking Severus Snape was walking away from four other boys one looked like a scrawny heavily scared boy with light brown hair,one looked like the most arrogant prince with his long dark wavy hair and sky blue eyes,the other was a pudgy boy who looked like a mouse, the last one looked like an older version of him before he got blood adopted by Severus. Three of them were calling Severus names like Snivillus and Greasy Haired Bastard while the last one the scrawny one tried to stop them only to be hit with a silencing charm"Pathetic Snivillus"the one that looked like Harry sneered before all three walked away as the scrawny one ran over to Severus"Finite Incantartum" Severus chanted eliminating the spells on him and the light haired boy as another boy who looked a nicer,prettier version of the arrogant prince walked over looking worried "Sev,Remus are you two alright?" He asked as he knelt down next to them"The scrawny boy must be Remus" Harry thought as he continued watching the memory"Yes Regulus we're mostly alright" Severus said as he slid to the ground exhausted "They've been getting worse" Remus sighed as he mimicked Severus' actions "Why do you still involve yourself with them?" Regulus asked as he ran a basic diagnostic spell on them"Were dorm mates they drag me with them against my will. I assure you ever since the Screaming Shack include I want nothing to do with Black or Potter much less that disgusting Rat" Remus growled before facing the two Slytherins "Thank you again for warning me and forgiving me""Never really did much except be a coward the first three years and besides you saved Regulus from his brother's idiotic antic" Severus said barely glancing at the Gryffindor as he pulled out a potion for the boy to take "Here Wolfsbane for the full moon since you will be with Regulus and I this night""Mhm I already planned for the three to get detention" Regulus said smirking "I definitely got my dad's smile and smirk" Harry though amused as he watched his dad help the two older students up before separating ways Days later during their Herbology lesson Asvoria, Hermione and Neville noticed that Harry was extremely distracted thankfully Neville was his partner and so he was relatively safe since Neville was their Herbology protege"What's wrong with Harrison?" Hermione asked worried for her friend"I don't know" Asvoria sighed sadly before she noticed that her plants looked sad as did many of the plants "But Im sure he'll tell us eventually""I hope I don't think anyone like seeing him this way"Hermione said frowning"Ahhhhhh!!!!!!!"Padma screamed as a plant was biting her hair immediately Asvoria and Harry rushed over along with Neville to get the plant to let go while everyone except Terry,Su,Hermione and another Gryffindor named Dean Thomas laughed"Shhhhhh...tama na yan oh hindi ka ipapahamak" Asvoria said softly as she petted the plant's head while unknowingly emitting a gentle aura and to their surprise it purred at the attention it was getting until it yawned which gave Harry a chance to get Padma's hair out of its mouth"Professor Sprout" Asvoria said as she presented the still purring plant to the Hufflepuff head"Thank you ms. White and five points each for helping a fellow students"she said shocked"Some sister you are" Asvoria sneered at Parvati who instead of helping her twin laughed at herAfter Herbology they all headed to potions with the Hufflepuffs where Susan,Wayne Hopkins and Hannah Abbot were waiting for them and immediately noticed the foul mood of the Ravens and the sadness in Padma's eyes"Did something happen?" Wayne asked"Someone put a Snapping Hydrangea in Padma's hair and instead of helping like a normal sibling Parvati just laughed at her she was closest to Padma they were partners but she did nothing" Terry grumbled"Harry,Neville and Asvoria had to step in to help and we were the farthest away from Padma We couldn't help because Terry and I were sent outside for an errand when we came back everyone was just laughing while Asvoria,Harry and Neville got the Hydrangea to let go"Stupid jerks"Harry growled out as he and everyone else went into the laboratoryAfter potion Harry stayed after telling his sister that he needed to talk to Severus alone and he'll be at their study room soon"What can I do for you Harrison?" Severus asked noticing that his secondarium heredis stayed behind"Why weren't you repulsed by my appearance the first time we met I was a carbon copy of that horrible bully" Harry asked his eyes watering"So you did watch you bearers memories. Well the question to you answer mr. White is because you were and are not him. Thus far all I've seen from you is a younger Regulus or a younger Daniel. You have Regulus' understanding nature,his thirst for knowledge and your father Daniel's generosity, good instinct and from what you mother said good heart. I never saw that arrogant fool in you in any angle after I talked to you for the first time I never saw Harry Potter again I saw Harrison Daniel White son of my best friend,my godson and a son of two of the most incredible muggles that I am honored to have met" Severus said sincerely as he drew the now crying boy into a fatherly hug"Thanks tito Severus I needed that" Harry said after he cried his heart out"Not a problem brat now of to your muggle studies you go"The potions master said as he pushed the boy towards his door "Oh and mr. White you will have a visitor this summer"As always I don't own Harry Potter and I forgot to tell you that I may edit a chapter if I find it a problem or if I forgot somethingTagalogEnglishtama na yan oh hindi ka ipapahamakThats enoughyou're not indanger

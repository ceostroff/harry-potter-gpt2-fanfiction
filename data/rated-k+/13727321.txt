Written for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry (Challenges & Assignments)Prompts are at the end.Word Count: 798There's a horse dragging Draco around by the foot, and it's absolutely hilarious.Of course, then Hermione has to go and rescue him (and sure, it's only because Draco's going to take her to see the floating lanterns), grabbing onto Draco's arms and pulling until the horse ends up with a boot and she ends up with a thief named Dragon Lucius Malfoy (he is never letting go of that, even though no one can understand him when he teases Draco).The horse got the better deal, Harry thinks. But then Hermione has to shield Draco with herself as the horse charges, and Harry wishes his human wasn't so… protective. Though he supposes he can't talk, because the horse shows no sign of stopping, but Harry has to keep Hermione safe, so he finds himself hissing threateningly, puffing himself up to look more dangerous, though he could realistically do nothing to the horse that's probably a hundred times larger than he is.Miraculously, the horse slows, staring at Harry with an expression that's probably incredulous disbelief. It's an expression that only gets more and more obvious as Hermione starts talking about animal rights and slave labor, and Harry gets the feeling that the horse hasn't moved to get Draco again because the situation is just that ridiculous.And then they learn that the horse's name is Tom. It's clear that Tom doesn't like his name, but Harry thinks it's a lot better than Dragon Lucius Malfoy.Somehow, Hermione manages to negotiate a truce between Tom and Draco for the twenty-four hours of her birthday, then gets distracted by the city, so it falls to Harry to make sure the two actually behave.And if he turns a blind eye to a few of Tom's jabs at Draco, well… He's liking this horse more and more, now.Though it is nice of Draco to get those children to help Hermione braid her hair. That is, until it becomes clear that he expects something from Hermione, in turn. And it's only a dance, but Harry is absolutely furious at the thief, because doesn't he know that Hermione hates performing in front of crowds? (Well, no, he wouldn't, but that doesn't make Harry any less angry, because Draco should know, if he's going to court Hermione.)And if it's not as horrible as Harry would've expected, if it does serve to let Hermione go out of her comfort zone a bit, if both Hermione and Draco are smiling at the end, faces flushed from emotion and exertion… well Harry still doesn't approve of this thief trying to steal his human away. Even if this is what makes Hermione happy…Well Tom gets it.But then night falls and it turns out that Draco's prepared a little rowboat so they can go out on the water when the lanterns come out, and Harry kind of struggles to remember that this is still part of the deal Hermione tricked Draco into making, that Draco's only doing this for the crown. And then Harry sees, from the shore because he'd rather stay with Tom than be trapped in a tiny space with Draco, the thief bring out two already-lit lanterns for Hermione and Draco to release and… well…Fine.He's probably a really strange mix of orange, yellow, pink, and crimson right now, and he can see Tom laughing at him out of the corner of his eye, but fine.Maybe Draco isn't as bad of a person as Harry first thought. Maybe he would be good for Hermione. Maybe, just maybe… Draco and Hermione would be good together.Then Tom trots off abruptly, and Harry panics - is he going to turn Draco in, just when Harry accepted Draco and Hermione's relationship? But no, it turns out he's only going to… going to…Oh.One miniature paper lantern, glowing softly gold, that sits on an empty bench by the lake.Is this… is this for Harry?Tom rolls his eyes and throws Harry off his back and onto the bench when he doesn't move, and Harry can't find it in him to retaliate. Because this…He moves to grab the lantern, then glances back to Tom. It isn't right, exactly, if he just lets it go himself, is it? So carefully, Harry wraps his tail around the lantern and climbs onto Tom's back again, ignoring the horse's uneasy whines as he makes his way up Tom's mane and onto his head, then transfers the lantern to his front paws. He can tell, the moment Tom gets what he's trying to do.But together, right?Letting out a heavy sigh, Tom lowers his head, then slowly raises, just as Harry lets go.Beautiful.Also, when those twenty-four hours are up, he's rooting for Tom.Autumn Seasonal ChallengesDays of the Year & Religious Events: 17th October - Sweetest Day: Write about someone being sweetNative American History Month: Sacagawea: Write about someone joining and aiding a pair/group on their journey.Pet Peeves Week: Sudden stoppers when walking - Write about bumping into someoneChemistry Week: Rhenium: RomanticUnited Nations Day: Bulgaria: (action) DancingPrincess Day: Moana - Write about someone wanting to exploreCrystals & Gemstones: Emerald: Item: CrownWriting Club: OctoberRecord Collection: 21 - Rolling in the Deep: Write about always having someone by your side in difficult moments.Eras: Games: Super Mario - Write about visiting another world/a hidden worldTime Machine: Setting: Downtown or a town squareShowtime: Good Old Fashioned Wedding - (action) DancingElizabeth's Empire: (trope) found familyLiza's Loves: Fey Eladrin - Write about a mood swing.

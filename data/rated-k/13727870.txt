welcome it is my challenge for harry potter fanfiction . my challeng is all about a different school other than hogward for harry to learn from but in there teachers are former students from hogward from game mystery of hogward it a flexible idea because ther are many differences depending how you played and which characters you use the most . in there you cang yourself be mentor of harry and his friends if you add some . you can add another lessons way to learn even different school like for instance an ancient tomb founded by a yourself ( curse breaker ) you can add your own relationship you wished for and anything more . you can even make your own end for game if real one is not to your liking.relationship : Harry x daphne greengrass ( preferable but if not , oh well...) but can be anything but harry x ginny ( not real fan of this , too much ) , any other as long as not harem ( no more than one girl for harry ) , preferable no slash in main pairing ,must be : not godlike harry but strong ( specialist ) is OK not Overpowered wizard , more than just harry in school ( if you want you can create few ocs .you decide : old laws ( about superiority of husband above wife , for me its stupid because in wizard word most people look for power and not strenght so technically they are equal in power so ideas as trophy wifes is without merit for some people . WBWL ( Wrong boy who lived ) - only because of it it will be possible for harry to not go in hogwards without fuss . maybe alive potters , maybe sibling for harry . X-overs ( or at least idea s) are ok to add . wandless magic - ok . times change - so should people . bashing - you decide if you want , its your story so you should be deciding foes and alliesIf you got any questions about this challenge PM me and i try to help and answer . please Pm me if you start writing about this so i coud read this . have a good rest goodbye
